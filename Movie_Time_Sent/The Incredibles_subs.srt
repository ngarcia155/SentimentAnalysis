1
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,025
- Is this on?
- That's fine.

2
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,777
I can break through walls,
I just can't...

3
00:00:38,819 --> 00:00:40,946
- That's fine.
- I can't get this on.

4
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:44,325
Mr. Incredible...
Do you have a secret identity?

5
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:48,329
Every superhero has a secret identity.
I don't know a single one who doesn't.

6
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:51,624
Who wants the pressure
of being super all the time?

7
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,753
Of course I have a secret identity.

8
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:59,506
Can you see me in this
at the supermarket? Come on.

9
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,842
Who'd want to go shopping
as Elastigirl, know what I mean?

10
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:07,723
Superladies, they're always trying
to tell you their secret identity.

11
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,934
Think it'll strengthen
the relationship or something.

12
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:16,357
I said, "Girl, I don't want to know
about your mild-mannered alter ego."

13
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,028
I mean, you tell me you're
a super-mega-ultra-lightning-babe,

14
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,990
that's all right with me.
I'm good. I'm good.

15
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:27,164
No matter how many times
you save the world,

16
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:30,876
it always manages to get back
in jeopardy again.

17
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,421
Sometimes I just want it to stay saved,
you know?

18
00:01:34,504 --> 00:01:37,883
For a little bit. I feel like the maid.
"I just cleaned up this mess.

19
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:40,552
"Can we keep it clean
for ten minutes?"

20
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:42,346
I could get to that point.

21
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:45,307
- "Please?"
- We're not finished.

22
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:48,727
Sometimes I think I'd just like
the simple life, you know?

23
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,229
Relax a little and raise a family.

24
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:54,483
Settle down? Are you kidding?
I'm at the top of my game!

25
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,277
I'm up there with the big dogs!
Girls, come on.

26
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:00,739
Leave the saving of the world
to the men? I don't think so.

27
00:02:02,074 --> 00:02:03,116
I don't think so.

28
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:03,687
Mr. Incredible.

29
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:11,486
- What is it, ma'am?
- My cat, Squeaker, won't come down.

30
00:03:14,114 --> 00:03:17,450
Certainly. I suggest you stand clear.
There could be trouble.

31
00:03:17,492 --> 00:03:18,868
No, he's quite tame.

32
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,925
Let go now.

33
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:52,193
Thank you, Mr. Incredible.
You've done it again.

34
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,362
- You're the best.
- No, I'm just here to help.

35
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:56,823
<i>All units.
We have a tour bus robbery...</i>

36
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59,367
Tour bus robbery. I've still got time.

37
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:01,661
Officers. Ma'am. Squeaker.

38
00:04:02,454 --> 00:04:04,748
- Cool! Ready for take-off!
- What the...

39
00:04:04,831 --> 00:04:07,417
- Who are you supposed to be?
- I'm IncrediBoy.

40
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,085
What? No.

41
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:11,379
You're that kid from the fan club.

42
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:14,174
Brophy. Brody.
Buddy! Buddy!

43
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:16,051
My name is IncrediBoy.

44
00:04:16,134 --> 00:04:18,219
I've been nice, I've stood for photos,

45
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:20,889
signed every scrap of paper
you pushed at me...

46
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,600
No, don't worry about training me.
I know your moves,

47
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:26,645
crime fighting style,
favorite catch phrases, everything!

48
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:28,438
I'm your number one fan!

49
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,485
Hey! Hey, wait!

50
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:43,870
You know,

51
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:47,916
you can tell a lot about a woman
by the contents of her purse,

52
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,960
but maybe that's not
what you had in mind.

53
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:52,087
Hey, look...

54
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:58,927
Elastigirl.

55
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,096
Mr. Incredible.

56
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:04,641
- It's all right. I've got him.
- Sure, you've got him.

57
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,810
- I just took him out for you.
- Sure, you did.

58
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:09,604
- His attention was on me.
- A fact I exploited to do my job.

59
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:12,607
- My job, you mean.
- A simple thank you will suffice.

60
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,818
Thanks, but I don't need any help.

61
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:16,903
Whatever happened to "ladies first"?

62
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,155
Well, whatever happened
to equal treatment?

63
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:21,825
Look, the lady got me first.

64
00:05:21,908 --> 00:05:25,120
- Well, we could share, you know.
- I work alone.

65
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:27,664
Well, I think you need to be more

66
00:05:28,665 --> 00:05:29,791
flexible.

67
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:32,210
Are you doing anything later?

68
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,671
I have a previous engagement.

69
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:48,101
Now, you just stay here.

70
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:51,146
They usually pick up
the garbage in an hour.

71
00:05:51,187 --> 00:05:53,815
- Hey, Incredible!
- Hey, Frozone!

72
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:57,318
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- I still got time.

73
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:00,905
He's gonna jump!

74
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:17,172
I think
you broke something.

75
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:20,341
With counseling,
I think you'll come to forgive me.

76
00:06:20,425 --> 00:06:22,218
Wait a minute.

77
00:06:51,623 --> 00:06:53,875
Bomb Voyage.

78
00:06:56,008 --> 00:06:58,427
And IncrediBoy!

79
00:06:58,594 --> 00:07:00,137
IncrediBoy?

80
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:05,058
Aren't you curious about how I get
around so fast? I have rocket boots.

81
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,727
- Go home, Buddy. Now.
- What?

82
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,354
Can we talk?

83
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,565
You always say be true to yourself,

84
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:14,443
but you never say
which part to be true to.

85
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:19,323
Well, I've finally figured out who I am.
I am your ward. IncrediBoy!

86
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:22,451
And now, you have officially
carried it too far, Buddy.

87
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:24,745
This is because I don't have powers,
isn't it?

88
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,914
Not every superhero has powers,
you know.

89
00:07:26,997 --> 00:07:28,790
You can be super without them.

90
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:32,336
I invented these.
I can fly. Can you fly?

91
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,671
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

92
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:39,902
Just give me one chance!
I'll show you. I'll go get the police.

93
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:42,238
- Buddy, don't!
- It'll only take a second, really.

94
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,615
No, stop!
There's a bomb!

95
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:48,828
Let go, you're wrecking
my flight pattern.

96
00:07:48,911 --> 00:07:51,789
- I can do this if you let go!
- Will you just...

97
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:55,084
- I'm trying to help! Stop!
- Let go of my cape!

98
00:08:39,003 --> 00:08:43,007
Take this one home. And make sure
his mom knows what he's been doing.

99
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,009
I can help you.
You're making a mist...

100
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:47,178
The injured jumper.
You sent paramedics?

101
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,221
They picked him up.

102
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:50,723
The blast in that building
was caused by Bomb Voyage

103
00:08:50,807 --> 00:08:52,350
who I caught robbing the vault.

104
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:55,019
We might nab him
if we set up a perimeter.

105
00:08:55,061 --> 00:08:57,021
- He got away?
- Well, yeah.

106
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,357
- Skippy here made sure of that.
- IncrediBoy.

107
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,027
You're not affiliated with me!
Holy smokes, I'm late.

108
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,279
Listen, I've gotta be somewhere.

109
00:09:05,947 --> 00:09:08,866
- What about Bomb Voyage?
- Any other night, I'd go after him,

110
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:13,037
but I really gotta go. Don't worry.
We'll get him! Eventually!

111
00:09:19,544 --> 00:09:21,754
- Is the night still young?
- You're very late.

112
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:25,216
- How do I look? Good?
- The mask. You still got the mask.

113
00:09:28,052 --> 00:09:29,220
Showtime.

114
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:37,061
Robert Parr, will you have this woman
to be your lawful wedded wife?

115
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:40,231
You're late. When you asked
if I was doing anything later,

116
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:43,609
I didn't realize you'd forgotten.
I thought it was playful banter.

117
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,070
- It was.
- Cutting it close, don't you think?

118
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,698
You need to be more flexible.

119
00:09:48,739 --> 00:09:51,158
I love you, but if we're
gonna make this work,

120
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:53,411
you've gotta be more
than Mr. Incredible.

121
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:55,580
You know that. Don't you?

122
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:58,124
- ...so long as you both shall live?
- I do.

123
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:01,085
I pronounce this couple
husband and wife.

124
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:07,425
As long as we both shall live.
No matter what happens.

125
00:10:07,466 --> 00:10:11,637
Hey, come on. We're superheroes.
What could happen?

126
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,781
<i>In a stunning turn of
events, a superhero is being sued</i>

127
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:21,285
<i>for saving someone who,
apparently, didn't want to be saved.</i>

128
00:10:21,327 --> 00:10:22,995
<i>The plaintiff, Oliver Sansweet,</i>

129
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:26,540
<i>who was foiled in his attempted
suicide by Mr. Incredible,</i>

130
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:30,628
<i>has filed suit against the famed
superhero in Superior Court.</i>

131
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:34,089
Mr. Sansweet didn't ask to be saved.
He didn't want to be saved.

132
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:37,134
The injury received from
Mr. Incredible's "actions,"

133
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:39,553
- causes him daily pain.
- I saved your life!

134
00:10:39,637 --> 00:10:41,931
You didn't save my life!
You ruined my death.

135
00:10:41,972 --> 00:10:43,682
My client has no comment.

136
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:48,437
<i>Another suit was filed
by victims of the El train accident.</i>

137
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:51,607
<i>Incredible's court losses
cost the government millions.</i>

138
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:56,028
<i>And opened the floodgates for dozens
of superhero lawsuits the world over.</i>

139
00:10:56,111 --> 00:11:01,075
It is time for their secret identity
to become their only identity.

140
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:04,161
Time for them to join us, or go away.

141
00:11:04,244 --> 00:11:07,164
<i>Under public pressure,
and the financial burden</i>

142
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:09,708
<i>of an ever mounting series of lawsuits,</i>

143
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:13,837
<i>the government quietly initiated
the Superhero Relocation Program.</i>

144
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:17,383
<i>The supers were granted amnesty
from responsibility for past actions,</i>

145
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:21,845
<i>in exchange for the promise
to never again resume hero work.</i>

146
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:23,597
<i>Where are they now?</i>

147
00:11:23,681 --> 00:11:27,977
<i>They are living among us.
Average citizens, average heroes.</i>

148
00:11:28,018 --> 00:11:33,357
<i>Quietly and anonymously continuing
to make the world a better place.</i>

149
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:37,319
Denied? You're denying my claim?

150
00:11:38,112 --> 00:11:40,990
I don't understand.
I have full coverage.

151
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:43,200
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,

152
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:44,743
but our liability is spelled out
in paragraph 17.

153
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:48,733
- It states clearly...
- I can't pay for this.

154
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,568
Excuse me. Claims, Bob Parr.

155
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:53,238
I'm calling to celebrate
a momentous occasion.

156
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:55,615
We're now officially moved in.

157
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,492
Yeah, well, that's great, honey.

158
00:11:57,575 --> 00:11:59,911
The last three years
don't count because...

159
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:04,082
Because I finally unpacked the last box.
Now, it's official. Ha, ha, ha.

160
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,583
<i>Why do we have
so much junk?</i>

161
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,126
Listen, I've got a client.

162
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:10,296
Say no more. Go save the world
one policy at a time, honey.

163
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,674
Oh! I gotta go pick up the kids.
See you tonight.

164
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,677
Bye, honey.
Excuse me. Where were we?

165
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,306
I'm on a fixed income,
and if you can't help me,

166
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,433
I don't know what I'll do.

167
00:12:30,233 --> 00:12:33,528
All right, listen closely.
I'd like to help you, but I can't.

168
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:37,282
I'd like to tell you to take a copy
of your policy to Norma Wilcox on...

169
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:40,285
Norma Wilcox.
W-I-L-C-O-X.

170
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,620
On the third floor. But I can't.

171
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:46,791
I also do not advise you
to fill out and file a WS2475 form

172
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,793
with our legal department
on the second floor.

173
00:12:48,876 --> 00:12:52,130
I wouldn't expect someone to get back
to you quickly to resolve the matter.

174
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:54,591
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

175
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:55,967
Oh, thank you, young man.

176
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,803
Sorry.
I know you're upset!

177
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:00,388
Pretend to be upset.

178
00:13:04,434 --> 00:13:06,311
Parr!

179
00:13:06,644 --> 00:13:08,813
You authorized payment
on the Walker policy!

180
00:13:08,896 --> 00:13:10,982
Someone broke
into their house, Mr. Huph.

181
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:14,152
- Their policy covers...
- I don't wanna know about it.

182
00:13:14,235 --> 00:13:18,072
Don't tell me about it. Tell me how
you're keeping Insuricare in the black.

183
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:20,366
Tell me how that's possible,
with you writing checks

184
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,829
to every Harry Hardluck and Sally
Sobstory that gives you a phone call.

185
00:13:26,998 --> 00:13:30,001
<i>Morning break is over.
Morning break is over.</i>

186
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,591
I appreciate you coming
down here, Mrs. Parr.

187
00:13:37,634 --> 00:13:41,012
What's this about?
Has Dash done something wrong?

188
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:45,266
He's a disruptive influence and he
openly mocks me in front of the class.

189
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,727
- He says.
- Look, I know it's you!

190
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:50,855
- He puts thumbtacks on my stool.
- You saw him do this?

191
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,733
Well... Not really. No.

192
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:54,942
Actually, not.

193
00:13:55,026 --> 00:13:57,070
Oh, then how do you know it was him?

194
00:13:57,153 --> 00:13:59,697
I hid a camera.
Yeah, and this time, I've got him.

195
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:08,581
See? You see?

196
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,291
You don't see it?

197
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,879
He moves! Right there!

198
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:18,383
Wait, wait! Right there!

199
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,093
Right as I'm sitting down!

200
00:14:20,176 --> 00:14:21,886
I don't know how he does it,

201
00:14:21,969 --> 00:14:24,222
but there's no tack before he moves

202
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:28,434
and after he moves, there's a tack.
Coincidence? I think not!

203
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,399
- Bernie...
- Don't "Bernie" me.

204
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,567
This little rat is guilty!

205
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:41,072
You and your son can go now,
Mrs. Parr. I'm sorry for the trouble.

206
00:14:41,155 --> 00:14:44,117
You're letting him go again?
He's guilty!

207
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,829
You can see it on his smug little face.
Guilty, I say, guilty!

208
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:56,337
Dash, this is the third time this year
you've been sent to the office.

209
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:00,925
We need to find a better outlet.
A more constructive outlet.

210
00:15:01,008 --> 00:15:03,845
Maybe I could,
if you'd let me go out for sports.

211
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:06,097
Honey, you know why we can't do that.

212
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:10,685
I promise I'll slow up.
I'll only be the best by a tiny bit.

213
00:15:10,768 --> 00:15:12,645
Dashiell Robert Parr,

214
00:15:12,729 --> 00:15:16,274
you are an incredibly competitive boy.
And a bit of a showoff.

215
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,443
The last thing you need is temptation.

216
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:21,946
You always say, "Do your best."
But you don't really mean it.

217
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,240
Why can't I do the best that I can do?

218
00:15:24,282 --> 00:15:26,951
Right now, honey,
the world just wants us to fit in,

219
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,579
and to fit in, we just gotta be
like everybody else.

220
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,540
Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be ashamed of.

221
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:36,210
- Our powers made us special.
- Everyone's special, Dash.

222
00:15:36,294 --> 00:15:38,921
Which is another way
of saying no one is.

223
00:15:49,432 --> 00:15:50,975
Rydinger, where you headed?

224
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,563
- Hi, Tony.
- Hey.

225
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:59,400
- "Hey, Tony, can I carry your books?"
- That's kind of funny.

226
00:15:59,484 --> 00:16:02,195
"Hey, Tony, do you play football?"

227
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:07,366
Tony, I thought we were
gonna go swimming.

228
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:10,745
He looked at me.

229
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:14,665
Come on, Violet!

230
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:41,150
Darn kids.
Sitting on the driveway...

231
00:16:42,443 --> 00:16:44,570
Oh, great.

232
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,483
Mom.

233
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:27,405
- You're making weird faces again.
- No, I'm not.

234
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:29,907
You make weird faces, honey.

235
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:33,411
- Do you have to read at the table?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

236
00:17:34,245 --> 00:17:36,539
Smaller bites, Dash. Yikes!

237
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:39,709
Bob, could you help
the carnivore cut his meat?

238
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,089
Dash, you have something you
wanna tell your father about school?

239
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,258
Well, we dissected a frog.

240
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,926
Dash got sent to the office again.

241
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,596
- Good. Good.
- No, Bob, that's bad.

242
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:54,807
- What?
- Dash got sent to the office again.

243
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:56,601
- What? What for?
- Nothing.

244
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:59,437
He put a tack on the teacher's chair,
during class.

245
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:02,565
Nobody saw me.
You could barely see it on the tape.

246
00:18:02,607 --> 00:18:05,818
They caught you on tape
and you still got away with it? Whoa!

247
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,404
You must have been booking.
How fast were you going?

248
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:09,822
We are not encouraging this.

249
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:12,158
I'm not, I'm just asking how fast...

250
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:13,951
Honey!

251
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:19,248
Great. First the car,
now I gotta pay to fix the table...

252
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,000
What happened to the car?

253
00:18:22,251 --> 00:18:25,046
Here. I'm getting a new plate.

254
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:28,257
So, how about you, Vi?
How was school?

255
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:31,135
- Nothing to report.
- You've hardly touched your food.

256
00:18:31,218 --> 00:18:34,847
- I'm not hungry for meatloaf.
- Well, it is leftover night.

257
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:37,892
We have steak, pasta...
What are you hungry for?

258
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:40,686
- Tony Rydinger.
- Shut up.

259
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,731
- Well, you are.
- I said, shut up, you little insect.

260
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:46,484
- Well, she is.
- Do not shout at the table.

261
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,820
- Honey!
- Kids! Listen to your mother.

262
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,532
She'd eat if we were having Tony loaf.

263
00:18:53,616 --> 00:18:55,326
That's it!

264
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:56,619
Stop it!

265
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:01,165
- You're gonna be toast!
- Stop running in the house.

266
00:19:01,832 --> 00:19:03,167
Sit down!

267
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,796
- Hey, no force fields!
- You started it.

268
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:09,465
You sit down! You sit down!

269
00:19:09,507 --> 00:19:10,883
Violet!

270
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:18,766
"Simon J. Paladino,

271
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:23,709
"longtime advocate of superhero rights,
is missing"?

272
00:19:24,584 --> 00:19:28,547
- Gazerbeam.
- Bob! It's time to engage.

273
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,966
Do something!
Don't just stand there!

274
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:34,052
- I need you to intervene!
- You want me to intervene?

275
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:35,929
Okay. I'm intervening!

276
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:39,641
Violet, let go of your brother.

277
00:19:40,017 --> 00:19:41,560
Hello?

278
00:19:42,436 --> 00:19:44,187
Get the door.

279
00:19:44,521 --> 00:19:48,066
- Hey, Lucius!
- Hey, Speedo. Helen, Vi, Jack-Jack.

280
00:19:49,725 --> 00:19:51,769
- Ice of you to drop by.
- Ha! Never heard that one before.

281
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,812
Lucius!

282
00:19:53,896 --> 00:19:54,939
Whoa!

283
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,568
- Ha, ha.
- Oh!

284
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,238
- I like it when it shatters.
- I'll be back later.

285
00:20:02,613 --> 00:20:04,865
- Where are you two going?
- It's Wednesday.

286
00:20:05,574 --> 00:20:08,244
Bowling night.
Say hello to Honey for me, Lucius.

287
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:10,996
Will do. Good night, Helen.
Good night, kids.

288
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,254
Don't think you've avoided
talking about the principal's office.

289
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:20,381
Your father and I
are still gonna discuss it.

290
00:20:20,464 --> 00:20:23,259
I'm not the only kid who's
been sent to the office.

291
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,219
Other kids don't have superpowers.

292
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:29,348
- Now, it's perfectly normal...
- What do you know about normal?

293
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,809
What does anyone
in this family know about normal?

294
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:35,688
- Now, wait a minute, young lady.
- We act normal. I wanna be normal.

295
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:39,650
The only normal one is Jack-Jack,
and he's not even toilet trained.

296
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:42,945
Lucky.

297
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:45,489
I meant about being normal.

298
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:49,910
So now I'm in deep trouble.

299
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:53,289
I mean, one more jolt of this
death ray and I'm an epitaph.

300
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,834
Somehow I managed to find cover.
What does Baron Von Ruthless do?

301
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:59,461
- He starts monologuing.
- He starts monologuing.

302
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:03,507
He starts this prepared speech
about how feeble I am compared to him.

303
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:07,845
How inevitable my defeat is, the world
will soon be his. Yada, yada, yada.

304
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:09,179
- Yammering.
- Yammering.

305
00:21:09,263 --> 00:21:12,599
I mean, the guy has me
on a platter, and he won't shut up.

306
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:14,977
<i>Municiberg, we have a 23-56...</i>

307
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:16,562
23-56, what is that?

308
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,605
- Robbery?
- This is just sad.

309
00:21:18,689 --> 00:21:20,858
- Want to catch a robber?
- No.

310
00:21:20,899 --> 00:21:23,193
Tell you the truth,
I'd rather go bowling.

311
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:27,781
Look, what if we actually did
what our wives think we're doing?

312
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,408
Just to shake things up.

313
00:21:29,783 --> 00:21:34,163
He's not alone.
The fat guy's still with him.

314
00:21:34,204 --> 00:21:36,582
They're just talking.

315
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,793
- What are we doing here?
- Protecting people.

316
00:21:39,877 --> 00:21:42,171
- Nobody asked us.
- You need an invitation?

317
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:45,841
I'd like one, yes. We keep
sneaking out to do this, and...

318
00:21:45,883 --> 00:21:49,345
- You remember Gazerbeam?
- There was something in the paper.

319
00:21:49,386 --> 00:21:52,681
- He had trouble with civilian life.
- When did you see him?

320
00:21:52,723 --> 00:21:56,310
I don't see anyone from the old days.
Just you.

321
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:58,604
- And we're pushing our luck as it is.
- Come on.

322
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:01,482
It was fun the first time,
but if we keep doing this...

323
00:22:01,565 --> 00:22:05,027
<i>- We have a report on a fire...</i>
- A fire. We're close!

324
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:07,738
- Yeah, baby!
- We're gonna get caught.

325
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:13,160
Fire! Yeah!

326
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:23,420
- Is that everybody?
- Yeah.

327
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:28,258
- It better be.
- Can't you put this out?

328
00:22:28,342 --> 00:22:31,595
I can't lay down a layer thick enough!
It's evaporating too fast!

329
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:33,806
- What's that mean?
- It means it's hot.

330
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:36,225
- I'm dehydrated, Bob.
- You're out of ice?

331
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:38,685
You can't run out.
You can use water in the air.

332
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:42,564
There is no water in this air!
What's your excuse, run out of muscle?

333
00:22:42,606 --> 00:22:45,567
I can't smash walls.
The building's getting weaker.

334
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:48,779
- It's gonna come down on top of us.
- I wanted to go bowling!

335
00:22:51,532 --> 00:22:55,160
All right! Stay right on my tail!
This is gonna get hot!

336
00:23:08,048 --> 00:23:09,174
Yeah.

337
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,304
Uh-oh.

338
00:23:14,388 --> 00:23:15,973
Oh, good.

339
00:23:18,517 --> 00:23:19,643
That ain't right.

340
00:23:21,979 --> 00:23:25,482
- We look like incompetent bad guys!
- You can get water out of the air.

341
00:23:25,566 --> 00:23:27,067
Freeze!

342
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:32,990
Freeze!

343
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:35,909
- I'm thirsty.
- I said freeze!

344
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:38,829
I'm just getting a drink.

345
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:47,838
- You've had your drink. Now...
- I know. I know. Freeze.

346
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,426
Police officers!

347
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:06,315
That was way too close.

348
00:24:06,356 --> 00:24:09,067
We are not doing that again.

349
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:14,656
<i>Verify you want
to switch targets? Over.</i>

350
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:18,202
Trust me. This is the one
he's been looking for.

351
00:24:44,228 --> 00:24:47,564
- I thought you'd be back by 11:00.
- I said I'd be back later.

352
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:50,317
I assumed you'd be back later.
If you came back at all,

353
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,404
- you'd be "back later".
- Well, I'm back, okay?

354
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,080
Is this rubble?

355
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:06,583
It was just
a little workout. Just to stay loose.

356
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:10,337
You know how I feel about that.
Darn you! We can't blow cover again.

357
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,256
The building was coming down anyway.

358
00:25:12,297 --> 00:25:13,549
What?

359
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,217
You knocked down a building?

360
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:18,303
It was on fire. Structurally unsound.
It was coming down.

361
00:25:18,387 --> 00:25:20,764
Have you been listening
to the police scanner again?

362
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:23,934
I performed a public service.
You act like that's a bad thing.

363
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:25,435
It is a bad thing, Bob!

364
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:29,648
Uprooting our family again, so you can
relive the glory days is a bad thing.

365
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:32,609
It's better than acting like
they didn't happen!

366
00:25:32,693 --> 00:25:35,571
Yes! They happened!
But this, our family,

367
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:39,116
is what's happening now, Bob.
And you are missing this!

368
00:25:39,157 --> 00:25:42,327
I can't believe you don't want to go to
your own son's graduation.

369
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:45,455
It's not a graduation.
He's moving from fourth to fifth grade.

370
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:47,624
- It's a ceremony!
- It's psychotic!

371
00:25:47,666 --> 00:25:50,460
They keep creating new ways
to celebrate mediocrity

372
00:25:50,502 --> 00:25:52,462
but if someone is exceptional...

373
00:25:52,504 --> 00:25:54,798
This is not about you, Bob.
It's about Dash.

374
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,718
You want to do something for Dash?
Let him actually compete.

375
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,637
- Let him go out for sports!
- I will not be made the enemy!

376
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:03,181
- You know why we can't do that.
- Because he'd be great.

377
00:26:03,265 --> 00:26:05,434
This is not about you!

378
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:11,064
All right, Dash.
I know you're listening. Come on out.

379
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:13,442
Vi? You, too, young lady.

380
00:26:13,483 --> 00:26:15,861
Come on. Come on out.

381
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:19,239
It's okay, kids.
We're just having a discussion.

382
00:26:19,323 --> 00:26:21,116
Pretty loud discussion.

383
00:26:21,158 --> 00:26:24,828
But that's okay. What's important
is that Mommy and I are a team.

384
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:30,751
- We're united, uh, against forces of...
- Pigheadedness?

385
00:26:30,834 --> 00:26:33,378
- I was gonna say evil.
- We're sorry we woke you.

386
00:26:33,462 --> 00:26:36,173
Everything's okay.
Go back to bed. It's late.

387
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,008
- Good night, Mom. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

388
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,511
In fact, we should all be in bed.

389
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:59,321
<i>Request claim
on claim numbers 158183...</i>

390
00:26:59,738 --> 00:27:01,615
<i>Haven't you got him yet?
Where is he?</i>

391
00:27:01,698 --> 00:27:04,701
<i>Mr. Huph would like to talk
to you in his office.</i>

392
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:06,870
- Now?
<i>- Now.</i>

393
00:27:25,597 --> 00:27:26,640
Sit down, Bob.

394
00:27:31,853 --> 00:27:36,358
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

395
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,028
- Ask me why.
- Okay. Why?

396
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,905
Why what? Be specific, Bob.

397
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:43,615
Why are you unhappy?

398
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:45,534
Your customers make me unhappy.

399
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:47,327
What, you've gotten complaints?

400
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:48,912
Complaints I can handle.

401
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:52,582
What I can't handle is your customers'
inexplicable knowledge

402
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:56,628
of Insuricare's inner workings!
They're experts. Experts, Bob!

403
00:27:56,712 --> 00:27:59,756
Exploiting every loophole,
dodging every obstacle!

404
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:02,342
They're penetrating the bureaucracy!

405
00:28:02,426 --> 00:28:05,178
- Did I do something illegal?
- No.

406
00:28:05,262 --> 00:28:09,558
- We shouldn't help our customers?
- The law requires that I answer no.

407
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,936
- We're supposed to help people.
- Help our people!

408
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:14,896
Starting with our stockholders.

409
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:17,357
Who's helping them out, huh?

410
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:23,780
You know, Bob, a company...

411
00:28:23,864 --> 00:28:25,115
Is like an enormous clock.

412
00:28:25,198 --> 00:28:29,202
...is like an enormous...
Yes. Precisely.

413
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:34,583
It only works if all
the little cogs mesh together.

414
00:28:34,624 --> 00:28:39,838
Now, a clock needs to be cleaned,
well-lubricated and wound tight.

415
00:28:39,921 --> 00:28:44,968
The best clocks have jewel movements,
cogs that fit, that cooperate by design.

416
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,179
I'm being
metaphorical, Bob.

417
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:49,765
Know what I mean by cooperative cogs?

418
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:51,600
Bob?

419
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:54,978
Bob? Look at me
when I'm talking to you, Parr.

420
00:28:55,061 --> 00:28:58,064
- That man out there, he needs help.
- Don't change the subject.

421
00:28:58,148 --> 00:29:01,234
- We're discussing your attitude.
- He is getting mugged!

422
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:03,862
- Well, let's hope we don't cover him.
- I'll be right back.

423
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:07,491
Stop right now or you're fired!

424
00:29:09,993 --> 00:29:12,162
Close the door.

425
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:16,249
Get over here, now.

426
00:29:19,961 --> 00:29:23,548
I'm not happy, Bob. Not happy.

427
00:29:24,633 --> 00:29:28,261
- He got away.
- Good thing, too.

428
00:29:28,345 --> 00:29:30,972
You were this close to losing your...

429
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,358
Uh-oh.

430
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:46,696
<i>Please report to
operating room 722 immediately.</i>

431
00:29:53,662 --> 00:29:54,871
- How is he?
- He'll live.

432
00:29:54,955 --> 00:29:56,832
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- You think?

433
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:59,042
- What can I say, Rick?
- Nothing you haven't said before.

434
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:01,419
- Someone was in trouble.
- Always.

435
00:30:01,503 --> 00:30:04,381
- I had to do something.
- Every time you say that,

436
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:06,675
it's a month and a half
of trouble for me.

437
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:09,052
Hundreds of thousands
of taxpayer's dollars.

438
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:11,638
- I know.
- We pay to keep the company quiet.

439
00:30:11,721 --> 00:30:14,808
We pay damages, erase memories,
relocate your family.

440
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:17,561
Every time it gets harder.
Money, money, money.

441
00:30:17,644 --> 00:30:21,690
We can't keep doing this. We
appreciate what you did in the old days,

442
00:30:21,731 --> 00:30:25,068
but those days are over.
From now on, you're on your own.

443
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,617
Listen, Bob. Maybe I could relocate you,
you know, for old times' sake.

444
00:30:32,701 --> 00:30:36,037
I can't do that to my family.
Everyone just got settled.

445
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:38,331
I'll make it work. Thanks.

446
00:30:38,415 --> 00:30:40,417
Take care of yourself.

447
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,806
What are you waiting for?

448
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:58,935
I don't know.
Something amazing, I guess.

449
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:01,354
Me, too, kid.

450
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:26,136
Huh?

451
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:40,442
"Hold still"?

- Something's happened.
- What?

- The, uh...
- What?

487
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:30,519
The company is sending me
to, uh, a conference.

488
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,813
- A conference?
- Out of town.

489
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:34,356
I'm gonna be gone for a few days.

490
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:39,027
They've never sent you to a conference
before. This is good, isn't it?

491
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:40,154
Yes.

492
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:43,365
You see? They're finally
recognizing your talents.

493
00:34:43,407 --> 00:34:44,950
- You're moving up.
- Yes.

494
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:48,162
- Honey! This is wonderful!
- Yes, it is.

495
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:51,498
<i>Hello?</i>

496
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,542
This is Mr. Incredible.

497
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:55,377
I'm in.

498
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:05,762
The Omnidroid 9000
is a top secret prototype battle robot.

499
00:35:05,846 --> 00:35:09,266
Its artificial intelligence
enables it to solve any problem

500
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:12,227
it's confronted with.
And, unfortunately...

501
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:15,898
Let me guess. It got smart enough
to wonder why it had to take orders.

502
00:35:15,939 --> 00:35:20,068
We lost control. Now it's loose
in the jungle, threatening our facility.

503
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,280
We've had to evacuate all personnel
from the island for their own safety.

504
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:24,406
How am I going in?

505
00:35:24,448 --> 00:35:28,368
The Omnidroid's defenses necessitate
an air drop from 5,000 feet.

506
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,830
Its cloaking devices
make it difficult to track.

507
00:35:31,914 --> 00:35:35,083
We're pretty sure it's on
the southern half of the island.

508
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:39,087
One more thing. Obviously it
represents a significant investment.

509
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,548
You want me to shut it down
without destroying it.

510
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:44,176
You are Mr. Incredible.

511
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:05,906
I've got to warn you,
it's a learning robot.

512
00:36:05,948 --> 00:36:09,701
Every moment you fight it increases
its knowledge of how to beat you.

513
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,954
Shut it down. Do it quickly.
Don't destroy it.

514
00:36:12,037 --> 00:36:15,540
- And don't die.
- Great. Thanks.

515
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:47,281
Showtime.

516
00:37:32,326 --> 00:37:33,368
Huh?

517
00:37:35,203 --> 00:37:36,913
Hmm.

518
00:37:52,387 --> 00:37:53,388
Uh-oh.

519
00:38:55,117 --> 00:38:56,660
Oh, my back!

520
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,224
Oh!

521
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:07,898
Surprising. We must bring him back.

522
00:40:07,981 --> 00:40:11,818
Sound the all clear,
and invite him to dinner.

523
00:40:30,754 --> 00:40:33,507
Most important, keep things light.

524
00:40:33,548 --> 00:40:37,469
Praise him. Make him feel
like we appreciate his abilities.

525
00:40:38,845 --> 00:40:40,096
Am I overdressed?

526
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,766
Actually, you look rather dashing.

527
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,894
- I take it our host is...
- I'm sorry.

528
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:49,189
He won't be dining with us.
He hopes you'll understand.

529
00:40:49,231 --> 00:40:53,068
Of course. I do usually make it a point
to know who I'm working for.

530
00:40:53,109 --> 00:40:56,112
He prefers a certain amount
of anonymity.

531
00:40:56,196 --> 00:40:58,573
Surely, you of all people
understand that.

532
00:40:58,615 --> 00:41:03,286
I was just wondering, of all the places
to settle down, why live...

533
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,707
With a volcano?
He's attracted to power. So am I.

534
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:11,586
- It's a weakness we share.
- Seems a bit unstable.

535
00:41:11,628 --> 00:41:14,839
I prefer to think of it
as misunderstood.

536
00:41:15,423 --> 00:41:16,508
Aren't we all?

537
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:19,302
Volcanic soil is among
the most fertile on Earth.

538
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:22,514
Everything at the table
was grown right here.

539
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:26,851
- How does it compare?
- Everything's delicious.

540
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:51,978
- Jeez.
- Hurry, honey.

541
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,356
Or you'll be late for work.

542
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:57,859
- Have a great day, honey.
- Thanks.

543
00:42:57,901 --> 00:43:00,820
- Help customers, climb ladders...
- Bring bacon.

544
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:02,906
All that jazz.

545
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:11,915
<i>You have an appointment?</i>

546
00:43:11,998 --> 00:43:13,875
I'm an old friend. I just wanted to...

547
00:43:13,917 --> 00:43:17,879
<i>- All visitors are required...
- Go check the electric fence.</i>

548
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:19,964
<i>What is it? Who are you?
What do you want?</i>

549
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,261
<i>My God, you've gotten fat. Come in.
Come, come.</i>

550
00:43:32,852 --> 00:43:37,273
Yes, things are going quite well.
Quite well. My God, no complaints.

551
00:43:37,357 --> 00:43:41,653
But, you know, it is not the same.
Not the same at all.

552
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:44,572
Weren't you in the news?
Some show in Prayge... Prague?

553
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:46,950
Milan, darling. Milan.

554
00:43:47,033 --> 00:43:50,995
Supermodels.
Nothing super about them.

555
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,248
Spoiled, stupid, little stick figures

556
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:55,875
with poofy lips who think only
about themselves.

557
00:43:55,959 --> 00:43:59,879
Feh! I used to design for gods.

558
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:06,094
But perhaps you come with a challenge,
eh? I was surprised to get your call.

559
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:08,471
E, I just need a patch job.

560
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:11,891
Hmm. This is megamesh.
Outmoded, but very sturdy.

561
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:16,479
And you've torn right through it!
What have you been doing, Robert?

562
00:44:16,563 --> 00:44:19,149
Moonlighting hero work?

563
00:44:19,232 --> 00:44:21,109
Must have happened a long time ago.

564
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:24,195
I see. This is a hobo suit, darling.

565
00:44:24,279 --> 00:44:26,781
You can't be seen in this.
I won't allow it!

566
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:31,077
- Fifteen years ago, maybe, but now?
- What do you mean? You designed it.

567
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,289
I never look back, darling.
It distracts from the now.

568
00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:36,958
You need a new suit.
That much is certain.

569
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:39,544
A new suit? Where the heck
am I gonna get a new suit?

570
00:44:39,627 --> 00:44:42,088
You can't! It's impossible!
I'm far too busy.

571
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:44,340
So ask me now,
before I again become sane.

572
00:44:44,424 --> 00:44:47,302
Wait. You want to make me a suit?

573
00:44:47,385 --> 00:44:50,722
You push too hard, darling!
But I accept.

574
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:53,892
- It will be bold. Dramatic!
- Yeah.

575
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:55,185
Heroic!

576
00:44:55,268 --> 00:44:58,938
Yeah, something classic, like Dynaguy!

577
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:02,650
Oh! He had a great look!
Oh, the cape and the boots...

578
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:03,777
No capes!

579
00:45:04,944 --> 00:45:08,990
- Isn't that my decision?
- Do you remember Thunderhead?

580
00:45:09,032 --> 00:45:11,826
<i>Tall, storm powers. Nice man.
Good with kids.</i>

581
00:45:11,868 --> 00:45:15,163
- Listen, E...
- November 15th of '58.

582
00:45:16,623 --> 00:45:18,708
<i>All was well, another day saved</i>

583
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:21,628
<i>when his cape snagged
on a missile fin.</i>

584
00:45:21,669 --> 00:45:24,005
Thunderhead was not
the brightest bulb...

585
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,131
Stratogale!

586
00:45:25,173 --> 00:45:30,512
<i>April 23rd, '57.
Cape caught in a jet turbine.</i>

587
00:45:30,553 --> 00:45:32,847
You can't generalize
about these things.

588
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:36,226
<i>Meta-Man. Express elevator.
Dynaguy, snag on takeoff.</i>

589
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:40,146
Splashdown, sucked into a vortex.
No capes!

590
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:43,650
Now, go on. Your new suit will be
finished before your next assignment.

591
00:45:43,691 --> 00:45:45,735
You know I'm retired from hero work.

592
00:45:45,819 --> 00:45:49,072
As am I, Robert.
Yet, here we are.

593
00:45:49,155 --> 00:45:53,535
E, I only need a patch job.
For sentimental reasons.

594
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:57,705
Fine.
I will also fix the hobo suit.

595
00:45:58,456 --> 00:46:02,377
- You're the best of the best, E.
- Yes, I know, darling. I know.

596
00:46:15,765 --> 00:46:17,725
Don't answer it, honey, I got it!

597
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,520
- Hello?
- We have a new assignment for you.

598
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:27,443
<i>- How soon can you get here?
- I'll leave tomorrow morning.</i>

599
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:29,320
<i>- See you there.</i>
- Goodbye.

600
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,883
Who was that, honey? The, uh, office?

601
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,886
Another conference.
Short notice, but, you know,

602
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,763
duty calls.

603
00:46:47,646 --> 00:46:49,606
- Bob?
- Yeah, what's up, honey?

604
00:46:51,524 --> 00:46:54,194
- Ha... Have a great trip.
- Thanks, sweetie.

605
00:46:54,277 --> 00:46:56,863
- I'll call you when I get there.
- I love you.

606
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:01,117
- So much.
- I love you, too.

607
00:47:14,285 --> 00:47:16,245
<i>This is your automated Captain.</i>

608
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:19,498
<i>Would you care for more mimosa?</i>

609
00:47:19,582 --> 00:47:22,752
- Don't mind if I do. Thanks.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

610
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:29,050
<i>Currently 78 degrees in Nomanisan.
Perfect weather for flying.</i>

611
00:47:35,014 --> 00:47:38,768
<i>Please fasten your seat belt.
We're beginning our descent.</i>

612
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:06,837
Hello, Mr. Incredible.
Nice suit.

613
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:08,214
Thanks.

614
00:48:08,255 --> 00:48:11,008
Nice to be back, Mirage.

615
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:40,579
You'll be briefed on your assignment
in the conference room at 2:00.

616
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:44,083
- D Wing, room A-113.
- 2:00. Got it.

617
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,626
See you there.

618
00:49:18,451 --> 00:49:19,577
Edna.

619
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:22,580
- I'd like to speak to Edna, please.
<i>- This is Edna.</i>

620
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:25,332
- E? This is Helen.
<i>- Helen who?</i>

621
00:49:25,416 --> 00:49:28,669
Helen Parr? You know...

622
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,921
Elastigirl?

623
00:49:30,963 --> 00:49:35,217
<i>Darling! It's been such a long time
after all these years! So long!</i>

624
00:49:35,301 --> 00:49:37,052
It's been a while.

625
00:49:37,136 --> 00:49:38,637
There's only one person
Bob would trust

626
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:40,389
to patch his super suit. That's you.

627
00:49:40,473 --> 00:49:42,475
Yes, yes, yes. Marvelous, isn't it?

628
00:49:42,516 --> 00:49:45,686
Much better than those
horrible pajamas he used to wear.

629
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,314
They are finished.
When are you coming to see?

630
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:50,483
<i>- I'm calling about...</i>
- Don't make me beg.

631
00:49:50,524 --> 00:49:52,026
- I won't do it, you know.
<i>- Beg?</i>

632
00:49:52,443 --> 00:49:54,737
No, I'm calling about suit.

633
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,615
Bob's suit!
I'm calling about Bob's suit.

634
00:49:57,656 --> 00:50:01,452
You come in one hour, darling.
I insist, okay? Okay. Goodbye.

635
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:15,966
Hmm.

636
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:34,193
It's bigger!

637
00:50:36,153 --> 00:50:37,571
It's badder!

638
00:50:38,864 --> 00:50:44,161
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's too much for Mr. Incredible!

639
00:50:46,163 --> 00:50:47,998
It's finally ready.

640
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:52,419
You know, I went through quite a few
supers to get it worthy to fight you,

641
00:50:52,503 --> 00:50:56,006
but, man, it wasn't good enough!

642
00:50:56,048 --> 00:51:00,052
After you trashed the last one, I had
to make some major modifications.

643
00:51:00,135 --> 00:51:03,222
Sure it was difficult,
but you are worth it.

644
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:07,476
I mean, after all, I am your biggest fan.

645
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:12,064
- Buddy?
- My name is not Buddy!

646
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:14,900
And it's not IncrediBoy either!

647
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:18,445
That ship has sailed.
All I wanted was to help you.

648
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:21,782
I only wanted to help!
And what did you say to me?

649
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:24,577
Fly home, Buddy. I work alone.

650
00:51:24,618 --> 00:51:28,414
<i>It tore me apart.
But I learned an important lesson.</i>

651
00:51:28,455 --> 00:51:30,416
<i>You can't count on anyone.</i>

652
00:51:30,708 --> 00:51:32,418
Especially your heroes.

653
00:51:32,501 --> 00:51:35,796
I was wrong to treat you that way.
I'm sorry.

654
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,300
See? Now you respect me,
because I'm a threat.

655
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:40,843
That's the way it works.

656
00:51:40,926 --> 00:51:43,679
There's a lot of people,
whole countries who want respect.

657
00:51:43,762 --> 00:51:46,348
And they will pay
through the nose to get it.

658
00:51:46,432 --> 00:51:49,059
How do you think I got rich?
I invented weapons.

659
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:53,147
Now I have a weapon only I can defeat.
And when I unleash it, I'll get...

660
00:51:55,149 --> 00:51:58,027
You sly dog!
You got me monologuing.

661
00:51:58,110 --> 00:51:59,945
I can't believe it.

662
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:07,161
It's cool, huh? Zero-point energy.
I save the best inventions for myself.

663
00:52:07,995 --> 00:52:09,788
Am I good enough now?

664
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,875
Who's super now?

665
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,461
I'm Syndrome! Your nemesis and...

666
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:18,714
Oh, brilliant!

667
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:39,151
All right, try this one on for size,
big boy.

668
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,355
Gazerbeam.

669
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:29,702
Kronos?

670
00:53:55,978 --> 00:53:59,732
<i>Life reading negative.
Mr. Incredible terminated.</i>

671
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:07,448
This project has completely
confiscated my life, darling.

672
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:11,785
Consumed me as only hero work can.
My best work, I must admit.

673
00:54:12,244 --> 00:54:16,165
Simple, elegant, yet bold. You will die.

674
00:54:16,248 --> 00:54:18,083
- E, I just...
- I did Robert's suit,

675
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:21,754
and it turned out so beautiful,
I had to continue.

676
00:54:21,795 --> 00:54:25,591
It's great to see you, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.

677
00:54:25,883 --> 00:54:27,968
- I just...
- Yes, words are useless.

678
00:54:28,052 --> 00:54:30,971
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
Too much of it, darling. Too much!

679
00:54:31,055 --> 00:54:33,140
That is why I show you my work.

680
00:54:33,432 --> 00:54:34,933
That is why you are here.

681
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:43,776
Edna Mode.

682
00:54:45,194 --> 00:54:46,528
And guest.

683
00:55:03,629 --> 00:55:05,172
Come. Sit.

684
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:11,887
- Cream and sugar?
- Thanks.

685
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:14,765
- I started with the baby.
- Started?

686
00:55:14,807 --> 00:55:18,811
Shh! Darling! I cut it a little
roomy for the free movement.

687
00:55:18,894 --> 00:55:21,814
The fabric is comfortable
for sensitive skin,

688
00:55:22,523 --> 00:55:26,819
And can also withstand
a temperature of over 1 000 degrees.

689
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:30,989
Completely bulletproof.

690
00:55:33,408 --> 00:55:35,953
And machine washable, darling.
That's a new feature.

691
00:55:36,328 --> 00:55:38,997
What on earth do you think
the baby will be doing?

692
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,168
Well, I'm sure I don't know, darling.
Luck favors the prepared.

693
00:55:43,627 --> 00:55:46,463
I didn't know the baby's powers,
so I covered the basics.

694
00:55:46,505 --> 00:55:49,049
- Jack-Jack doesn't have any powers.
- No?

695
00:55:49,133 --> 00:55:50,926
Well, he'll look fabulous anyway.

696
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:57,015
Your boy's suit I designed
to withstand enormous friction

697
00:55:57,057 --> 00:56:00,644
without heating up or wearing out.
A useful feature.

698
00:56:01,687 --> 00:56:04,064
Your daughter's suit was tricky.

699
00:56:04,148 --> 00:56:09,528
I finally created a sturdy material that
will disappear completely as she does.

700
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:17,452
Your suit can stretch as far as you can,
without injuring yourself,

701
00:56:17,536 --> 00:56:19,580
and still retain its shape.

702
00:56:20,372 --> 00:56:22,624
Virtually indestructible,

703
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:26,378
yet it breathes like Egyptian cotton.

704
00:56:26,628 --> 00:56:30,048
As an extra feature,
each suit contains a homing device,

705
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:34,386
giving you the precise global location
of the wearer at the touch of a button.

706
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:38,557
Well, darling? What do you think?

707
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:43,145
What do I think? Bob is retired!
I'm retired!

708
00:56:43,228 --> 00:56:44,730
Our family is underground.

709
00:56:44,813 --> 00:56:47,983
You helped my husband resume
secret hero work behind my back?

710
00:56:48,066 --> 00:56:50,611
Well, I assumed you knew, darling.

711
00:56:50,694 --> 00:56:53,572
Why would he keep secrets from you?

712
00:56:53,864 --> 00:56:56,283
He wouldn't. Didn't. Doesn't.

713
00:56:56,909 --> 00:57:00,287
Men at Robert's age are often unstable.

714
00:57:00,996 --> 00:57:03,832
- Prone to weakness.
- What are you saying?

715
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:06,460
Do you know where he is?

716
00:57:06,543 --> 00:57:09,463
- Of course.
- Do you know where he is?

717
00:58:40,971 --> 00:58:44,099
- Hey, hey. We got a man down!
- Come on, let's go.

718
00:58:48,353 --> 00:58:50,522
Are you okay?
What happened?

719
00:58:52,983 --> 00:58:56,194
<i>Break surveillance
and engage. Continuing sweep...</i>

720
01:00:37,712 --> 01:00:40,465
- <i>Insuricare.</i>
- Oh, hello. This is Helen Parr.

721
01:00:40,507 --> 01:00:42,092
Bob Parr is my husband.

722
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:45,387
I was wondering if you could give me
the number of the hotel he's staying at?

723
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:49,850
- The number I have is no good.
<i>- Mr. Parr no longer works here.</i>

724
01:00:49,933 --> 01:00:53,228
What do you mean? He's on
a business trip. A company retreat.

725
01:00:53,311 --> 01:00:56,356
<i>My records say he was terminated
almost two months ago.</i>

726
01:01:27,673 --> 01:01:30,050
So, you don't know where he is.

727
01:01:32,469 --> 01:01:35,389
Would you like to find out?

728
01:02:52,494 --> 01:02:56,832
I am such an idiot.
I let this happen, you know.

729
01:02:57,749 --> 01:03:01,545
The new sports car, the getting
in shape, the blond hair, the lies.

730
01:03:01,628 --> 01:03:04,506
Yes, he attempts to relive the past.

731
01:03:04,589 --> 01:03:09,010
Now I'm losing him! What'll I do?
What'll I do?

732
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:11,513
What are you talking about?

733
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:17,227
You are Elastigirl! My God!
Pull yourself together.

734
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,396
What will you do? Is this a question?

735
01:03:19,479 --> 01:03:21,982
Show him you remember
that he is Mr. Incredible,

736
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:25,026
and you will remind him who you are!

737
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:29,364
Well, you know where he is. Go!
Confront the problem! Fight! Win!

738
01:03:30,031 --> 01:03:33,368
And call me when you get back, darling.
I enjoy our visits.

739
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,037
There's lots of leftovers
that you can reheat.

740
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:40,458
Make sure Dash does his homework.
And both of you, get to bed on time.

741
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:42,419
I should be back tonight. Late.

742
01:03:42,502 --> 01:03:43,879
You can be in charge that long,
can't you?

743
01:03:44,004 --> 01:03:47,174
Yeah. But why am I in charge again?

744
01:03:47,215 --> 01:03:49,634
Nothing. Just a little trouble with Daddy.

745
01:03:49,718 --> 01:03:54,055
You mean Dad's in trouble,
or Dad is the trouble?

746
01:03:54,097 --> 01:03:57,934
I mean either he's in trouble,
or he's going to be.

747
01:04:04,691 --> 01:04:07,110
What's that?
Where'd you get that, Mom?

748
01:04:07,194 --> 01:04:09,321
You made a cool outfit?
Hey, are those for us?

749
01:04:09,404 --> 01:04:10,822
We all get cool outfits?

750
01:04:12,157 --> 01:04:13,909
Dash!
You come back here this moment!

751
01:04:16,369 --> 01:04:18,872
Hey, Snug. Thanks for getting back.

752
01:04:18,914 --> 01:04:21,750
I know this is short notice,
but I was hoping that I could...

753
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,753
- What are these?
- Look, I'm The Dash!

754
01:04:25,337 --> 01:04:27,589
- The Dash likes.
- Just a second.

755
01:04:28,256 --> 01:04:31,885
- Take that off before somebody sees.
- You're packing one just like it.

756
01:04:31,927 --> 01:04:34,763
- Are you hiding something?
- Please. I'm on the phone...

757
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,015
- Dash!
- This is yours. It's specially made.

758
01:04:37,098 --> 01:04:40,435
- What's going on?
- You're not coming! I gotta pack!

759
01:04:42,938 --> 01:04:44,981
What makes you think it's special?

760
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:47,817
I don't know. Why'd Mom try to hide it?

761
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,788
Snug, I'm calling in a solid you owe me.

762
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,458
- <i>What do you need?</i>
- A jet. What do you got that's fast?

763
01:05:03,541 --> 01:05:05,627
<i>Let me think.</i>

764
01:05:14,469 --> 01:05:17,472
Island approach.
India Golf niner-niner checking in.

765
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,224
VFR on top. Over.

766
01:05:22,185 --> 01:05:24,980
Island tower,
this is India Golf niner-niner

767
01:05:25,021 --> 01:05:27,357
requesting vectors to the initial.

768
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:40,328
Easy, Helen. Easy. Easy, girl.

769
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:44,624
You're overreacting. Everything's fine.
They're just all getting coffee.

770
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,754
At the same time. Yeah.

771
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:08,523
You, sir, truly are "Mr. Incredible."
I was right to idolize you.

772
01:06:08,606 --> 01:06:11,484
I always knew you were tough,
but tricking the probe

773
01:06:11,526 --> 01:06:15,530
by hiding under the bones
of another super? Oh, man!

774
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:18,033
I'm still geeking out about it!

775
01:06:19,659 --> 01:06:22,871
And then you had
to just go and ruin the ride.

776
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:27,876
I mean, Mr. Incredible calling for help?
"Help me, help me."

777
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,378
Lame, lame, lame.

778
01:06:30,462 --> 01:06:31,880
All right, who did you contact?

779
01:06:31,963 --> 01:06:34,799
Contact? What are you talking about?

780
01:06:39,846 --> 01:06:42,974
I am referring to last night
at 23:07 hours

781
01:06:43,058 --> 01:06:46,227
while you were snooping around.
You sent out a homing signal.

782
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:49,230
I didn't know about the homing device.

783
01:06:53,735 --> 01:06:57,781
And now a government plane
is requesting permission to land here.

784
01:06:57,864 --> 01:06:58,865
Who did you contact?

785
01:06:58,907 --> 01:07:01,034
I didn't send for a plane.

786
01:07:01,076 --> 01:07:02,994
Play the transmission.

787
01:07:04,245 --> 01:07:07,624
<i>- India Golf checking in.</i>
- Helen!

788
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:10,794
So you do know these people.

789
01:07:10,877 --> 01:07:14,005
Well, then,
I'll send them a little greeting.

790
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:18,551
- Ow!
- Violet!

791
01:07:18,593 --> 01:07:20,095
It's not my fault.

792
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,222
Dash ran away,
I knew I'd get blamed for it.

793
01:07:22,263 --> 01:07:24,099
That's not true!

794
01:07:24,182 --> 01:07:26,601
You said, "Something's up with Mom.
We have to find out what."

795
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:30,522
- ...and it's not my fault!
- Hundred percent all-yours idea!

796
01:07:30,605 --> 01:07:33,441
Wait a minute.
You left Jack-Jack alone?

797
01:07:33,525 --> 01:07:36,653
- Of course we got a sitter.
- We got someone, Mom.

798
01:07:36,736 --> 01:07:39,030
- We wouldn't do that.
- Thanks a lot!

799
01:07:39,114 --> 01:07:41,908
All right, well, who'd you get?

800
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:44,411
You don't have to worry
about one thing.

801
01:07:44,452 --> 01:07:47,789
I've got baby-sitting wired.
I've taken courses, learned CPR,

802
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:51,459
- excellent marks and certificates.
- Kari.

803
01:07:51,501 --> 01:07:53,711
I brought Mozart to play while he sleeps

804
01:07:53,795 --> 01:07:56,673
because leading experts say
Mozart makes babies smarter.

805
01:07:56,965 --> 01:07:57,966
- Kari...
<i>- The beauty is</i>

806
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,718
they don't have to listen
'cause they're asleep!

807
01:08:00,802 --> 01:08:02,929
I wish my parents played Mozart

808
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:05,974
because half the time I don't know
what anyone's talking about.

809
01:08:06,224 --> 01:08:09,686
Kari, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

810
01:08:09,769 --> 01:08:12,689
I'll pay you for your trouble,
but I'd rather call a service.

811
01:08:13,064 --> 01:08:14,774
There's really no need, Mrs. Parr.

812
01:08:14,816 --> 01:08:17,527
I can totally handle anything
this baby can dish out.

813
01:08:17,610 --> 01:08:20,363
Can't I, little baby?
I can handle it.

814
01:08:20,447 --> 01:08:22,365
<i>Who can handle it?</i>

815
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,625
India Golf niner-niner transmitting
in the blind guard.

816
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:34,586
Disengage. Repeat, disengage.

817
01:09:05,235 --> 01:09:06,945
Repeat, disengage.

818
01:09:07,029 --> 01:09:08,238
<i>- Friendlies...</i>
- No!

819
01:09:08,322 --> 01:09:09,823
Call off the missiles. I'll do anything.

820
01:09:09,906 --> 01:09:13,243
Too late. Fifteen years too late.

821
01:09:15,078 --> 01:09:18,123
Friendlies two-zero miles
south-southwest of your position.

822
01:09:18,206 --> 01:09:20,542
Angels 10. Track east. Disengage.

823
01:09:20,584 --> 01:09:23,128
Vi! Put a force field around the plane.

824
01:09:23,211 --> 01:09:24,963
You said not to use our powers.

825
01:09:25,047 --> 01:09:27,549
I know what I said.
Listen to what I'm saying now!

826
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:29,634
Disengage. Repeat, disengage!

827
01:09:34,306 --> 01:09:35,474
Mom?

828
01:09:36,099 --> 01:09:37,100
Violet!

829
01:09:37,184 --> 01:09:40,604
Mayday. India Golf niner-niner
is buddy-spiked. Abort!

830
01:09:40,687 --> 01:09:42,189
There are children aboard.

831
01:09:42,272 --> 01:09:43,982
<i>- There are children aboard!</i>
- No!

832
01:09:45,817 --> 01:09:47,277
Put a field around us now!

833
01:09:47,361 --> 01:09:48,820
I've never done one that big.

834
01:09:48,904 --> 01:09:49,988
Do it now!

835
01:09:51,573 --> 01:09:52,949
Abort, abort, abort!

836
01:09:55,410 --> 01:09:56,870
Abort, abort, abort!

837
01:10:28,026 --> 01:10:29,820
Brace yourselves!

838
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:39,162
- Mom!
- Everybody calm down.

839
01:10:39,204 --> 01:10:40,956
I'll tell you what we're not gonna do.

840
01:10:40,997 --> 01:10:43,583
We're not gonna panic, we're not...
Look out!

841
01:10:55,095 --> 01:10:57,514
- Oh, my God! Whose idea was this?
- What are we gonna do?

842
01:10:57,597 --> 01:11:00,142
We're dead! We're dead!

843
01:11:00,183 --> 01:11:03,103
- It blew up!
- We survived but we're dead!

844
01:11:03,186 --> 01:11:04,521
Stop it!

845
01:11:05,272 --> 01:11:06,898
We are not gonna die!

846
01:11:06,982 --> 01:11:08,942
Both of you will get a grip.

847
01:11:09,025 --> 01:11:11,445
Or so help me
I will ground you for a month!

848
01:11:11,653 --> 01:11:13,029
Understand?

849
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:17,951
We have a confirmed hit.
Target was destroyed.

850
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,078
Ah, you'll get over it.

851
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:23,748
I seem to recall
you prefer to "work alone."

852
01:11:33,884 --> 01:11:35,886
Release me. Now!

853
01:11:36,470 --> 01:11:37,471
Or what?

854
01:11:37,554 --> 01:11:39,097
I'll crush her.

855
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:42,058
That sounds a little dark for you.
Well, go ahead.

856
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,978
It'll be easy. Like breaking a toothpick.

857
01:11:45,353 --> 01:11:47,063
Show me.

858
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,703
I knew you couldn't do it.

859
01:12:01,786 --> 01:12:04,539
Even when you have nothing to lose.

860
01:12:04,789 --> 01:12:06,082
You're weak.

861
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:08,877
And I've outgrown you.

862
01:12:18,762 --> 01:12:22,557
Those were short-range missiles.
Land-based.

863
01:12:23,099 --> 01:12:24,601
That way is our best bet.

864
01:12:24,643 --> 01:12:27,437
You want to go toward
the people that tried to kill us?

865
01:12:27,521 --> 01:12:31,566
- If it means land, yes.
- Do you expect us to swim there?

866
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:34,444
I expect you to trust me.

867
01:13:36,047 --> 01:13:37,674
What a trooper.

868
01:13:38,717 --> 01:13:40,302
I'm so proud of you.

869
01:13:40,844 --> 01:13:42,220
Thanks, Mom.

870
01:13:48,226 --> 01:13:50,770
I think your father is in trouble.

871
01:13:50,854 --> 01:13:53,857
If you haven't noticed,
we're not doing so hot either.

872
01:13:54,232 --> 01:13:55,442
I'm going to look for him.

873
01:13:55,525 --> 01:13:58,361
And that means you're in charge
until I get back, Violet.

874
01:13:58,403 --> 01:14:00,655
- What?
- You heard her.

875
01:14:02,907 --> 01:14:06,661
Put these on. Your identity
is your most valuable possession.

876
01:14:06,995 --> 01:14:08,038
Protect it.

877
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:10,206
And if anything goes wrong,
use your powers.

878
01:14:10,248 --> 01:14:13,501
- But you said never to use...
- I know what I said!

879
01:14:16,504 --> 01:14:17,756
Remember the bad guys

880
01:14:17,839 --> 01:14:20,634
on those shows you used to watch
on Saturday mornings?

881
01:14:21,509 --> 01:14:24,220
Well, these guys
are not like those guys.

882
01:14:24,638 --> 01:14:28,016
They won't exercise restraint
because you're children.

883
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:31,353
They will kill you if they get the chance.

884
01:14:31,603 --> 01:14:33,730
Do not give them that chance.

885
01:14:33,813 --> 01:14:35,565
- Mom?
- Vi, I'm counting on you.

886
01:14:35,649 --> 01:14:38,777
- There's...
- I'm counting on you. Be strong.

887
01:14:40,236 --> 01:14:44,240
Dash, if anything goes wrong,
I want you to run as fast as you can.

888
01:14:44,282 --> 01:14:47,118
- As fast as I can?
- As fast as you can.

889
01:14:47,202 --> 01:14:50,830
Stay hidden. Keep each other safe.
I'll be back by morning.

890
01:14:54,918 --> 01:14:56,419
Mom!

891
01:14:57,420 --> 01:14:59,964
Mom, what happened on the plane.
I'm sorry.

892
01:15:00,048 --> 01:15:03,051
I wanted to help.
When you asked me to... I'm sorry.

893
01:15:03,093 --> 01:15:05,428
Shh. It isn't your fault.

894
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:09,099
It wasn't fair for me to suddenly
ask so much of you.

895
01:15:09,933 --> 01:15:11,726
But things are different now.

896
01:15:11,768 --> 01:15:14,813
And doubt is a luxury
we can't afford anymore, sweetie.

897
01:15:15,146 --> 01:15:17,232
You have more power than you realize.

898
01:15:17,732 --> 01:15:20,068
Don't think. And don't worry.

899
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,654
If the time comes,
you'll know what to do.

900
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,323
It's in your blood.

901
01:16:02,610 --> 01:16:05,989
- He's not weak, you know.
- What?

902
01:16:06,281 --> 01:16:08,366
Valuing life is not weakness.

903
01:16:08,658 --> 01:16:12,287
Hey. Look, if you're talking about
what happened in the containment unit,

904
01:16:12,328 --> 01:16:14,038
I had everything under control.

905
01:16:14,122 --> 01:16:17,000
And disregarding it is not strength.

906
01:16:17,417 --> 01:16:19,836
I called his bluff, sweetheart, that's all.

907
01:16:19,961 --> 01:16:22,422
I knew he wouldn't have it in him
to actually...

908
01:16:22,505 --> 01:16:25,258
Next time you gamble, bet your own life!

909
01:16:40,190 --> 01:16:41,858
Okay, okay, okay.

910
01:17:37,413 --> 01:17:38,748
A rocket?

911
01:18:34,178 --> 01:18:35,179
Hey!

912
01:19:32,236 --> 01:19:36,783
Well, not that this isn't fun,
but I'm gonna go look around.

913
01:19:36,866 --> 01:19:38,618
What do you think is going on here?

914
01:19:38,701 --> 01:19:40,828
You think we're on vacation?

915
01:19:41,245 --> 01:19:44,040
Mom and Dad's lives
could be in jeopardy.

916
01:19:44,123 --> 01:19:46,376
Or worse,
their marriage.

917
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:48,252
Their marriage?

918
01:19:48,544 --> 01:19:53,049
So, the bad guys are trying to wreck
Mom and Dad's marriage.

919
01:19:53,132 --> 01:19:55,301
Forget it. You're so immature.

920
01:19:55,385 --> 01:19:58,596
- I'm gonna go look around.
- Mom said to stay hidden.

921
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,517
I'm not gonna leave the cave. Sheesh.

922
01:20:41,264 --> 01:20:42,390
Cool!

923
01:20:43,433 --> 01:20:44,559
Cool!

924
01:20:46,686 --> 01:20:49,022
<i>Roger.
We are ready for launch.</i>

925
01:20:59,032 --> 01:21:02,452
- Vi, Vi!
- What did you do?

926
01:21:15,548 --> 01:21:17,133
<i>ETA two-niner. Over.</i>

927
01:21:20,678 --> 01:21:23,389
<i>TCI clear. Condition yellow.
Status norm.</i>

928
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:28,186
<i>Not responding to IFF.</i>

929
01:21:28,269 --> 01:21:30,063
<i>IRCM reads negative.</i>

930
01:21:31,898 --> 01:21:33,274
- Bob.
- What?

931
01:21:33,316 --> 01:21:34,567
I didn't say anything.

932
01:22:03,638 --> 01:22:05,556
<i>Identification, please.</i>

933
01:22:06,349 --> 01:22:07,350
Hey!

934
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:10,436
- Hey, Violet! Come here, look. It talks!
- What? What?

935
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,021
There. That one.

936
01:22:12,063 --> 01:22:13,689
<i>Voice key incorrect.</i>

937
01:22:14,273 --> 01:22:15,358
"Voice key"?

938
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:18,152
<i>Voice key incorrect.</i>

939
01:22:18,194 --> 01:22:19,862
Wait a second.

940
01:22:22,156 --> 01:22:23,533
- What do we do?
- Run!

941
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:25,701
- Where are we going?
- Away from here!

942
01:22:30,706 --> 01:22:34,127
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

943
01:22:55,815 --> 01:22:58,526
- There isn't much time.
- No, there isn't.

944
01:22:58,568 --> 01:23:01,028
In fact, there's no time at all.

945
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:03,239
- Please...
- Why are you here?

946
01:23:03,281 --> 01:23:08,286
How can you possibly bring me lower?
What more can you take away from me?

947
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:11,914
Family survived the crash.

948
01:23:12,248 --> 01:23:14,000
They're here on the island!

949
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:15,459
They're alive?

950
01:23:29,223 --> 01:23:30,975
- Helen?
- Hello.

951
01:23:31,559 --> 01:23:33,227
You must be Mrs...

952
01:23:34,437 --> 01:23:36,439
- She was helping me to escape.
- No.

953
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,442
That's what I was doing. Let go of me!

954
01:23:39,525 --> 01:23:42,612
Let go, you lousy, lying,
unfaithful creep!

955
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:46,574
How could I betray the perfect woman?

956
01:23:46,616 --> 01:23:48,451
Oh, you're referring to me now?

957
01:23:48,534 --> 01:23:49,744
Where are the kids?

958
01:23:49,785 --> 01:23:51,621
- They triggered the alert.
- What?

959
01:23:51,662 --> 01:23:55,082
- Security's in the jungle. Get going.
- Our kids are in danger?

960
01:23:55,124 --> 01:23:56,918
If you suspected danger,
why'd you bring them?

961
01:23:56,959 --> 01:24:00,546
They stowed away.
You're not striking the proper tone.

962
01:24:08,846 --> 01:24:09,889
Think they're supers?

963
01:24:09,972 --> 01:24:12,433
Dash, remember what Mom said.

964
01:24:12,475 --> 01:24:13,976
- What?
- Stop talking!

965
01:24:14,644 --> 01:24:17,230
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Dash, run!

966
01:24:17,313 --> 01:24:19,023
- What?
- Run!

967
01:24:19,815 --> 01:24:22,235
- They're supers!
- Get the boy!

968
01:24:23,861 --> 01:24:25,154
Show yourself!

969
01:25:26,132 --> 01:25:27,216
Hey!

970
01:25:34,724 --> 01:25:36,100
Ha, ha!

971
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:54,076
I'm alive. Yeah!

972
01:25:56,078 --> 01:25:57,079
Uh-oh.

973
01:27:07,650 --> 01:27:09,985
I should've told you I was fired,
I admit it.

974
01:27:10,027 --> 01:27:11,320
But I didn't want you to worry.

975
01:27:11,404 --> 01:27:12,780
You didn't want me to worry?

976
01:27:12,822 --> 01:27:15,699
We're running for our lives
through some godforsaken jungle.

977
01:27:15,783 --> 01:27:18,994
You keep trying to pick a fight,
but I'm just happy you're alive.

978
01:27:21,455 --> 01:27:24,333
I know you're there,
Little Miss Disappear.

979
01:27:36,512 --> 01:27:38,722
You can't hide from me.

980
01:27:44,812 --> 01:27:47,148
- There you are.
- Hey!

981
01:27:51,485 --> 01:27:53,112
Don't touch my sister!

982
01:28:00,911 --> 01:28:03,122
- How are you doing that?
- I don't know!

983
01:28:03,205 --> 01:28:04,874
Whatever you do, don't stop!

984
01:28:21,599 --> 01:28:23,392
Mom! Dad! Hey!

985
01:28:25,269 --> 01:28:26,353
Kids.

986
01:28:26,395 --> 01:28:28,230
- You're all right.
- You're all right.

987
01:28:28,272 --> 01:28:30,774
- We were so worried.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

988
01:28:49,543 --> 01:28:50,628
I love you.

989
01:28:50,711 --> 01:28:52,213
- Wow.
- Whoa.

990
01:29:06,894 --> 01:29:08,270
Time out!

991
01:29:09,772 --> 01:29:13,234
What have we here?
Matching uniforms?

992
01:29:14,235 --> 01:29:17,655
Oh, no! Elastigirl?

993
01:29:19,281 --> 01:29:22,493
You married Elastigirl? Whoa!

994
01:29:23,619 --> 01:29:25,996
And got busy!

995
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,668
It's a whole family of supers.
Looks like I've hit the jackpot!

996
01:29:30,751 --> 01:29:33,337
Oh, this is just too good!

997
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:36,924
<i>- The ship's unique design...
- There were no fatalities...</i>

998
01:29:36,966 --> 01:29:41,971
Huh? Huh? Oh, come on!
You gotta admit, this is cool.

999
01:29:42,054 --> 01:29:45,391
Just like a movie!
The robot will emerge dramatically,

1000
01:29:45,474 --> 01:29:48,227
do some damage.
Throngs of screaming people!

1001
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:53,023
And just when all hope is lost,
Syndrome will save the day!

1002
01:29:53,274 --> 01:29:55,985
I'll be a bigger hero than you ever were!

1003
01:29:56,026 --> 01:30:00,197
You mean you killed off real heroes
so that you could pretend to be one?

1004
01:30:00,281 --> 01:30:03,033
Oh, I'm real.
Real enough to defeat you!

1005
01:30:03,117 --> 01:30:07,162
And I did it without your precious
gifts, your oh-so-special powers.

1006
01:30:07,246 --> 01:30:08,455
I'll give them heroics.

1007
01:30:08,497 --> 01:30:11,917
I'll give them the most spectacular
heroics anyone's ever seen!

1008
01:30:12,001 --> 01:30:15,170
And when I'm old and I've had my fun,
I'll sell my inventions

1009
01:30:15,254 --> 01:30:19,592
so that everyone can be superheroes.
Everyone can be super.

1010
01:30:20,342 --> 01:30:22,511
And when
everyone's super

1011
01:30:25,639 --> 01:30:27,349
no one will be.

1012
01:30:52,791 --> 01:30:54,752
Fire at will!

1013
01:31:02,217 --> 01:31:04,887
<i>It's overwhelming the tanks.</i>

1014
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:06,180
I'm sorry.

1015
01:31:06,722 --> 01:31:10,434
This is my fault.
I've been a lousy father.

1016
01:31:10,517 --> 01:31:14,313
Blind to what I have.
So obsessed with being undervalued

1017
01:31:14,396 --> 01:31:17,358
- that I undervalued all of you.
- Dad?

1018
01:31:17,399 --> 01:31:18,567
Shh. Don't interrupt.

1019
01:31:18,609 --> 01:31:21,320
So caught up in the past that I...

1020
01:31:23,238 --> 01:31:27,368
You are my greatest adventure.
And I almost missed it.

1021
01:31:27,409 --> 01:31:29,495
I swear, I'm gonna get us
out of this safely if I...

1022
01:31:29,578 --> 01:31:33,582
Well, I think Dad has made
some excellent progress today

1023
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:36,335
but I think it's time we wind down now.

1024
01:31:39,588 --> 01:31:41,256
We need to get back to the mainland.

1025
01:31:41,298 --> 01:31:43,967
I saw an aircraft hangar on my way in.
Straight ahead.

1026
01:31:53,977 --> 01:31:55,104
Where are all the guards?

1027
01:31:55,854 --> 01:31:57,147
Go, go!

1028
01:32:01,610 --> 01:32:04,446
Hey, every time they run,
you take a shot.

1029
01:32:20,629 --> 01:32:22,798
This is the right hangar,
but I don't see any jets.

1030
01:32:22,881 --> 01:32:25,384
- A jet's not fast enough.
- What's faster than a jet?

1031
01:32:26,343 --> 01:32:27,386
How about a rocket?

1032
01:32:31,515 --> 01:32:35,185
- Great! I can't fly a rocket.
- You don't have to.

1033
01:32:35,769 --> 01:32:37,980
Use the coordinates
from the last launch.

1034
01:32:40,065 --> 01:32:43,485
Wait. I bet Syndrome's changed
the password by now.

1035
01:32:43,527 --> 01:32:46,321
- How do I get into the computer?
<i>- Say please.</i>

1036
01:33:02,504 --> 01:33:04,256
- Honey?
- What?

1037
01:33:04,339 --> 01:33:06,175
- Where is my super suit?
- What?

1038
01:33:06,717 --> 01:33:09,928
Where is my super suit?

1039
01:33:10,012 --> 01:33:13,098
- I put it away.
- Where?

1040
01:33:13,182 --> 01:33:16,518
- Why do you need to know?
- I need it!

1041
01:33:16,602 --> 01:33:19,605
Don't you think about
running off doing no derrin'-do.

1042
01:33:19,688 --> 01:33:21,565
We've been planning
this dinner for two months!

1043
01:33:21,648 --> 01:33:25,027
- The public is in danger!
- My evening's in danger!

1044
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:28,614
Tell me where my suit is, woman!
We are talking about the greater good.

1045
01:33:28,697 --> 01:33:30,866
"Greater good"?
I am your wife!

1046
01:33:30,949 --> 01:33:33,869
I'm the greatest good
you are ever gonna get!

1047
01:33:37,581 --> 01:33:38,957
Run!

1048
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:42,044
My baby!

1049
01:33:46,715 --> 01:33:49,092
- The supers have returned!
- Is that Fironic?

1050
01:33:49,176 --> 01:33:52,429
- Fironic?
- No, Fironic has a different outfit.

1051
01:33:52,513 --> 01:33:57,476
No, no, I'm a new superhero!
I'm Syndrome!

1052
01:34:00,437 --> 01:34:02,314
All right, stand back.

1053
01:34:06,026 --> 01:34:10,447
Someone needs to teach
this hunk of metal a few manners.

1054
01:34:12,282 --> 01:34:13,492
Ha, ha!

1055
01:34:40,727 --> 01:34:43,981
- Are we there yet?
- We get there when we get there.

1056
01:34:46,358 --> 01:34:48,443
How you doing, honey?

1057
01:34:48,527 --> 01:34:51,071
Do I have to answer?

1058
01:34:53,448 --> 01:34:56,535
Kids, strap yourselves down
like I told you.

1059
01:35:00,873 --> 01:35:02,583
Here we go, honey.

1060
01:35:03,125 --> 01:35:04,293
Ready, Violet?

1061
01:35:05,335 --> 01:35:07,296
Ready? Now!

1062
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:12,634
This is gonna be rough.

1063
01:35:20,058 --> 01:35:22,394
Robot's in the financial district.
Which exit?

1064
01:35:22,477 --> 01:35:24,146
- Traction Avenue.
- That'll take me downtown.

1065
01:35:24,187 --> 01:35:25,814
- I take Seventh, don't I?
- Don't take Seventh!

1066
01:35:27,316 --> 01:35:29,902
- Great, we missed it.
- Ask how to get there, I told you.

1067
01:35:29,985 --> 01:35:31,820
- Traction.
- That'll take me downtown.

1068
01:35:31,862 --> 01:35:33,488
Get in the right lane! Signal!

1069
01:35:33,572 --> 01:35:35,115
- Not Traction!
- You're gonna miss it!

1070
01:36:02,935 --> 01:36:05,020
Is everybody okay back there?

1071
01:36:05,312 --> 01:36:08,857
- Super-duper, Dad!
- Let's do that again.

1072
01:36:12,069 --> 01:36:14,738
Wait here and stay hidden.
I'm going in.

1073
01:36:15,822 --> 01:36:18,367
While what?
I watch helplessly from the sidelines?

1074
01:36:18,408 --> 01:36:20,869
- I don't think so.
- I'm asking you to wait with the kids.

1075
01:36:20,953 --> 01:36:23,622
And I'm telling you not a chance.
You're my husband.

1076
01:36:23,705 --> 01:36:25,540
I'm with you for better or worse.

1077
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:27,626
I have to do this alone.

1078
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:29,628
- What is this to you? Playtime?
- No.

1079
01:36:29,711 --> 01:36:31,588
- So you can be Mr. Incredible again?
- No!

1080
01:36:31,672 --> 01:36:32,923
- Then what?
- I'm not...

1081
01:36:33,006 --> 01:36:35,050
- Not what?
- I'm not strong enough.

1082
01:36:35,092 --> 01:36:37,177
- This will make you stronger?
- Yes. No!

1083
01:36:37,219 --> 01:36:39,262
That's what this is?
Some sort of workout?

1084
01:36:39,346 --> 01:36:41,264
I can't lose you again!

1085
01:36:42,933 --> 01:36:45,560
I can't. Not again.

1086
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:48,146
I'm not strong enough.

1087
01:36:56,863 --> 01:36:59,700
If we work together,
you won't have to be.

1088
01:36:59,741 --> 01:37:00,951
I don't know what'll happen.

1089
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:04,037
We're superheroes. What can happen?

1090
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:10,460
Vi! Dash! No!

1091
01:37:20,345 --> 01:37:21,346
Violet?

1092
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:27,102
- Dad!
- Go, go!

1093
01:37:37,154 --> 01:37:40,282
- I'm okay, Mom. Really.
- Stay here, okay?

1094
01:37:51,376 --> 01:37:52,711
Frozone!

1095
01:37:52,794 --> 01:37:54,004
Yeah!

1096
01:37:56,798 --> 01:37:57,883
Bob!

1097
01:37:59,259 --> 01:38:00,260
Hey!

1098
01:38:16,526 --> 01:38:17,819
Syndrome's remote!

1099
01:38:27,662 --> 01:38:28,914
The remote controls the robot!

1100
01:38:32,334 --> 01:38:33,502
Throw it, throw it!

1101
01:38:33,585 --> 01:38:34,836
Go long!

1102
01:38:46,139 --> 01:38:47,265
Got it!

1103
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:54,106
Honey, take out its guns!

1104
01:39:01,404 --> 01:39:02,447
Gotcha!

1105
01:39:48,535 --> 01:39:50,203
Mom, I've got it! I've got the remote!

1106
01:39:51,997 --> 01:39:54,583
A remote? A remote that controls what?

1107
01:39:57,627 --> 01:39:58,628
The robot?

1108
01:40:06,928 --> 01:40:08,054
It's coming back!

1109
01:40:11,433 --> 01:40:12,601
- That wasn't right.
- Give me that!

1110
01:40:14,603 --> 01:40:17,606
We can't stop it. The only thing
hard enough to penetrate it is

1111
01:40:21,610 --> 01:40:22,611
itself.

1112
01:40:22,694 --> 01:40:23,945
It's getting closer!

1113
01:40:23,987 --> 01:40:26,114
- It doesn't work!
- Kids!

1114
01:40:27,741 --> 01:40:29,201
It's not doing anything.

1115
01:40:29,284 --> 01:40:31,286
- Try to buy us some time.
- Try the one next to it.

1116
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:38,293
Honey!

1117
01:40:44,299 --> 01:40:46,593
Wait a minute. Press that button again!

1118
01:40:48,136 --> 01:40:50,764
No, the other one! The first one!

1119
01:40:50,805 --> 01:40:52,015
First button! Got it!

1120
01:40:52,098 --> 01:40:53,725
- It's getting closer!
- Look out!

1121
01:40:54,643 --> 01:40:57,312
- Get out of here!
- We're not going anywhere.

1122
01:40:57,395 --> 01:40:59,147
- Press the button!
- Not yet!

1123
01:40:59,272 --> 01:41:01,775
- Helen!
- What are you waiting for?

1124
01:41:01,816 --> 01:41:04,152
A closer target! You got one shot!

1125
01:41:07,197 --> 01:41:08,198
Everybody duck!

1126
01:41:32,264 --> 01:41:33,390
Hey, Zone.

1127
01:41:39,688 --> 01:41:41,523
Huh? No!

1128
01:41:41,815 --> 01:41:45,694
Did you see that?
That's the way to do it.

1129
01:41:45,777 --> 01:41:49,948
- That's old school.
- Yeah. No school like the old school.

1130
01:41:52,993 --> 01:41:55,787
- Just like old times. Oh!
- Just like old times.

1131
01:41:55,870 --> 01:41:58,164
Yeah. Hurt then, too.

1132
01:42:01,584 --> 01:42:03,878
We've frozen all of Syndrome's assets.

1133
01:42:03,962 --> 01:42:08,008
If he even sneezes, we'll be there
with a hanky and a pair of handcuffs.

1134
01:42:08,049 --> 01:42:10,093
The people of this country
are indebted to you.

1135
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:11,845
Does this mean we can
come out of hiding?

1136
01:42:11,886 --> 01:42:13,930
Let the politicians figure that one out.

1137
01:42:14,014 --> 01:42:17,642
I've been asked to assure you
we'll take care of everything else.

1138
01:42:17,726 --> 01:42:18,727
You did good, Bob.

1139
01:42:19,936 --> 01:42:24,316
<i>Hi, this is Kari.
I have a question about Jack-Jack...</i>

1140
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:25,775
Come on. We're in a limo.

1141
01:42:26,276 --> 01:42:28,862
Hey, you're wearing your hair back?

1142
01:42:28,903 --> 01:42:31,740
- Yeah, I just... Yeah.
- It looks good.

1143
01:42:31,823 --> 01:42:34,492
- Thanks, Dad.
- That was cool when you threw that car!

1144
01:42:34,576 --> 01:42:36,870
Not as cool as you running on water.

1145
01:42:36,911 --> 01:42:40,749
That was sweet when you
snagged that bad guy with your arm

1146
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:43,418
and whip la shed him into the other guy.
Sweet!

1147
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:46,171
- I'm trying to listen to messages.
<i>- It's me.</i>

1148
01:42:46,254 --> 01:42:49,549
<i>Jack-Jack is fine,
but weird things are happening.</i>

1149
01:42:49,591 --> 01:42:53,219
<i>Jack-Jack's still fine,
but I'm getting really weirded out!</i>

1150
01:42:53,928 --> 01:42:55,305
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1151
01:42:55,388 --> 01:42:57,807
...aced those guys that tried to kill us!

1152
01:42:57,891 --> 01:43:02,020
That was the best vacation ever!
I love our family.

1153
01:43:02,103 --> 01:43:04,731
<i>I'm not fine, Mrs. Parr!</i>

1154
01:43:04,773 --> 01:43:07,692
<i>Put that down! Stop it!
You need to call me.</i>

1155
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,778
<i>I need help, Mrs...</i>

1156
01:43:09,861 --> 01:43:11,488
Bob, listen to this.

1157
01:43:11,571 --> 01:43:13,615
<i>I'm gonna call the police...</i>

1158
01:43:13,990 --> 01:43:15,742
<i>Hi, this is Kari.</i>

1159
01:43:15,784 --> 01:43:19,788
<i>Sorry for freaking out,
but your baby has special needs.</i>

1160
01:43:20,538 --> 01:43:22,123
<i>Thanks for sending a replacement.</i>

1161
01:43:22,207 --> 01:43:24,417
I didn't call a replacement.

1162
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:32,258
Shh. The baby is sleeping.

1163
01:43:35,345 --> 01:43:37,180
You took away my future.

1164
01:43:37,263 --> 01:43:40,642
I'm simply returning the favor.
Don't worry, I'll be a good mentor.

1165
01:43:40,725 --> 01:43:43,937
Supportive, encouraging.
Everything you weren't.

1166
01:43:44,229 --> 01:43:47,690
And in time, who knows,
he might make a good sidekick.

1167
01:43:52,195 --> 01:43:55,490
He's getting away, Bob!
We have to do something now.

1168
01:44:10,964 --> 01:44:12,424
What's happening?

1169
01:44:18,346 --> 01:44:21,516
- Stop him! Throw something!
- I might hit Jack-Jack.

1170
01:44:25,645 --> 01:44:27,105
Throw me.

1171
01:44:31,484 --> 01:44:32,944
Bob, throw me!

1172
01:44:39,117 --> 01:44:40,201
No!

1173
01:44:42,537 --> 01:44:45,748
This isn't the end of it!
I will get your son, eventually.

1174
01:44:45,832 --> 01:44:47,208
I'll get your son!

1175
01:44:49,335 --> 01:44:50,545
Oh, no.

1176
01:45:02,056 --> 01:45:04,934
Look at Mommy, honey.
Don't look down. Mommy's got you.

1177
01:45:05,894 --> 01:45:07,770
Everything is all right.

1178
01:45:23,411 --> 01:45:25,038
That's my girl.

1179
01:45:25,622 --> 01:45:27,999
Does this mean
we have to move again?

1180
01:45:31,628 --> 01:45:33,046
Oh, man.

1181
01:45:33,254 --> 01:45:35,798
That was totally wicked!

1182
01:45:53,069 --> 01:45:55,529
Do we have to have cheerleaders
at the track meet?

1183
01:45:55,613 --> 01:45:58,532
- What is that all about?
- I always thought it was more...

1184
01:45:58,616 --> 01:46:00,117
- Hey.
- Hey.

1185
01:46:00,159 --> 01:46:02,870
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

1186
01:46:02,953 --> 01:46:04,914
- See you, Vi.
- You look different.

1187
01:46:05,255 --> 01:46:08,592
I feel different. Is different okay?

1188
01:46:08,717 --> 01:46:11,970
Hey, different is...
Different is great.

1189
01:46:12,053 --> 01:46:14,014
Would you...

1190
01:46:14,222 --> 01:46:15,807
- Yeah?
- Do you think maybe...

1191
01:46:15,849 --> 01:46:17,559
- ...you and I...
- Yeah?

1192
01:46:17,642 --> 01:46:18,977
- Do you...
- Shh.

1193
01:46:19,144 --> 01:46:22,355
I like movies.
I'll buy the popcorn. Okay?

1194
01:46:23,273 --> 01:46:25,442
A movie.
There you go. Yeah.

1195
01:46:25,483 --> 01:46:28,194
- Wait, so Friday?
- Friday.

1196
01:46:33,325 --> 01:46:35,744
- Go, Dash, go.
- Run!

1197
01:46:35,827 --> 01:46:38,788
Come on, run! Pick up the pace.

1198
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:39,873
Run!

1199
01:46:39,956 --> 01:46:41,333
Pull back, pull back!

1200
01:46:41,416 --> 01:46:43,960
Pace it. Slow down just a little bit.

1201
01:46:44,586 --> 01:46:46,129
- Make it close!
- Second.

1202
01:46:46,171 --> 01:46:48,840
Close second, yeah!

1203
01:46:53,553 --> 01:46:55,138
That's my boy!

1204
01:46:55,513 --> 01:46:57,182
Dash, I'm so proud of you.

1205
01:46:57,265 --> 01:46:58,850
I didn't know what the heck
you wanted me to do.

1206
01:47:12,197 --> 01:47:15,200
<i>Behold the Underminer!</i>

1207
01:47:15,867 --> 01:47:18,370
<i>I am always beneath you,</i>

1208
01:47:18,411 --> 01:47:21,373
<i>but nothing is beneath me!</i>

1209
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:27,420
<i>I hereby declare war
on peace and happiness!</i>

1210
01:47:28,129 --> 01:47:32,717
<i>Soon all will tremble before me!</i>
