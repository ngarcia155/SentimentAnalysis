1
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:54,596
"Once upon a time
there was a lovely princess.

2
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,684
"But she had an enchantment
upon her of a fearful sort,

3
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:02,354
"which could only be broken
by love's first kiss.

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,066
"She was locked away in a castle

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,486
"guarded by a terrible
fire-breathing dragon.

6
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,825
"Many brave knights had attempted
to free her from this dreadful prison,

7
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,910
"but none prevailed.

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,913
"She waited in the dragon's keep

9
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,916
"in the highest room of the tallest tower,

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,546
"for her true love
and true love's first kiss."

11
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,632
Like that's ever gonna happen.

12
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,927
What a load of...

13
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,442
-Go!
-Go!

14
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,889
-I think it's in there.
-All right. Let's get it!

15
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:45,725
Hold on. Do you know
what that thing can do to you?

16
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,770
Yeah, it'll grind your bones for its bread.

17
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,816
Yes, well, actually,
that would be a giant.

18
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,945
Now, ogres, they're much worse.

19
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,948
They'll make a suit
from your freshly peeled skin.

20
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,117
-No!
-They'll shave your liver.

21
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,454
Squeeze the jelly from your eyes!

22
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,081
-Actually, it's quite good on toast.
-Back! Back, beast!

23
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,292
Back! I warn ya!

24
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,506
Right.

25
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:36,026
This is the part where you run away.

26
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,827
And stay out!

27
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,791
"Wanted. Fairy tale creatures."

28
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,300
All right. This one's full. Take it away!

29
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,347
-Move it along. Come on! Get up!
-Next!

30
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,350
Give me that! Your flying days are over.

31
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,061
That's 20 pieces of silver
for the witch. Next!

32
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,897
-Get up! Come on!
-Twenty pieces.

33
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:18,068
-Sit down there!
-Keep quiet!

34
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,863
This cage is too small.

35
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,032
Please don't turn me in.
I'll never be stubborn again.

36
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,742
I can change.
Please! Give me another chance!

37
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,578
-Shut up.
-Next!

38
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,540
-What have you got?
-This little, wooden puppet.

39
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,418
I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy.

40
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,005
Five shillings for the possessed toy.

41
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,174
-Take it away.
-Father, please! Don't let them do this!

42
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,926
-Help me!
-Next. What have you got?

43
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,887
Well, I've got a talking donkey.

44
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:50,517
Right. Well, that's good for 10 shillings,
if you can prove it.

45
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,436
Go ahead, little fella.

46
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,523
Well?

47
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,317
He's just... He's just a little nervous.

48
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:03,363
He's really quite a chatterbox.
Talk, you boneheaded dolt!

49
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,032
-That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
-No, no, he talks!

50
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,867
He does.

51
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,245
can talk. I love to talk.

52
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,248
I'm the talkingest
damn thing you ever saw.

53
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,875
-Get her out of my sight.
-No, no!

54
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,380
swear! He can talk!

55
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,093
Hey! I can fly!

56
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,803
-He can fly!
-He can fly!

57
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,597
He can talk!

58
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,267
That's right, fool!
Now I'm a flying, talking donkey.

59
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,978
You might have seen a housefly,
maybe even a superfly,

60
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,148
but I bet you ain't
never seen a donkey fly.

61
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,448
Seize him!

62
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,244
After him! He's getting away!

63
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,297
Get him! This way! Turn!

64
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,804
You, there. Ogre!

65
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,182
Aye?

66
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,934
By the order of Lord Farquaad,

67
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,353
I am authorised to place you both
under arrest

68
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:22,025
and transport you to
a designated resettlement facility.

69
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:26,154
Oh, really? You and what army?

70
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,917
Can I say something to you?

71
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,337
Listen, you was really, really somethin'
back there. Incredible!

72
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,176
Are you talkin' to me?

73
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,636
Yes, I was talkin' to you.

74
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,222
Can I tell you that you was great
back there? I mean, those guards.

75
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,016
They thought they was all of that.
Then you showed up, and bam!

76
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,060
They was trippin' over themselves
like babes in the woods.

77
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,062
That really made me
feel good to see that.

78
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,190
-That's great. Really.
-Man, it's good to be free.

79
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:07,821
Now, why don't you go celebrate your
freedom with your own friends?

80
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:13,952
But I don't have any friends,
and I'm not goin' out there by myself.

81
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,579
Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea!
I'll stick with you.

82
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,581
You're a mean, green, fightin' machine.

83
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,875
Together, we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.

84
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,924
Wow! That was really scary.

85
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,300
And if you don't mind me sayin',

86
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,720
if that don't work, your breath
certainly will get the job done,

87
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,555
'cause you definitely need
some Tic Tacs or something,

88
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,931
'cause your breath stinks!

89
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,226
Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose,

90
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,146
just like the time...

91
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,689
And then I ate some rotten berries.

92
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,941
I had strong gases eking out of my butt
that day.

93
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,736
Why are you following me?

94
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,406
I'll tell you why.

95
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,409
'Cause I'm all alone

96
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:58,246
There's no one here beside me

97
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,457
My problems have all gone

98
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,294
There's no one to deride me

99
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,464
But you gotta have friends

100
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,592
Stop singing!

101
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,719
It's no wonder
you don't have any friends.

102
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,431
Only a true friend
would be that truly honest.

103
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,602
Listen, little donkey.
Take a look at me. What am I?

104
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,735
-Really tall?
-No! I'm an ogre.

105
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,030
You know,
"Grab your torch and pitchforks."

106
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,115
Doesn't that bother you?

107
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,326
Nope.

108
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,287
-Really?
-Really, really.

109
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,499
Man, I like you. What's your name?

110
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,252
Shrek.

111
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:49,589
Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

112
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,634
You got that kind of l-don't-care
what-nobody-thinks-of-me thing.

113
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,513
I like that. I respect that, Shrek.
You all right.

114
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:01,684
Look at that.
Who'd want to live in a place like that?

115
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,979
That would be my home.

116
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:09,108
And it is lovely! Just beautiful.
You are quite a decorator.

117
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,820
It's amazing what you've done
with such a modest budget.

118
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:16,658
I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder.

119
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,122
I guess you don't entertain much,
do you?

120
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,999
I like my privacy.

121
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,919
You know, I do, too. That's another
thing we have in common.

122
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,796
Like, I hate it when
you got somebody in your face.

123
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,464
You're trying to give them a hint,
and they won't leave.

124
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,217
Then there's that big, awkward silence,
you know.

125
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,848
-Can I stay with you?
-What?

126
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,475
Can I stay with you, please?

127
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,894
-Of course!
-Really?

128
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,480
-No.
-Please! I don't wanna go back there!

129
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,359
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. Well, maybe you do.

130
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:54,028
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay!

131
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,240
-Please! Please!
-Okay! Okay!

132
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,909
-But one night only.
-Thank you!

133
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,328
-What are you... No! No!
-This is gonna be fun!

134
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,330
We can stay up late,
swappin' manly stories,

135
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,208
and in the mornin', I'm makin' waffles.

136
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,545
Where do I sleep?

137
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,380
Outside!

138
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,967
Oh, well, I guess that's cool.

139
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,719
I mean, I don't know you
and you don't know me,

140
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,221
so I guess outside is best, you know.

141
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,433
Here I go.

142
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,854
Good night.

143
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:33,610
I mean, I do like the outdoors.
I'm a donkey. I was born outside.

144
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:36,362
I'll just be sitting by myself
outside, I guess, you know.

145
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,740
By myself, outside.

146
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:43,620
I'm all alone
There's no one here beside me

147
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,520
I thought I told you to stay outside.

148
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,606
am outside.

149
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,574
Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm,
but what choice do we have?

150
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,160
It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

151
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:09,288
-What a lovely bed.
-Got ya.

152
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,999
found some cheese.

153
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,710
Awful stuff.

154
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,505
-Is that you, Gorder?
-How did you know?

155
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,217
Enough! What are you doing
in my house?

156
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,552
Hey!

157
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:26,639
Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table.

158
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,892
Where are we supposed to put her?
The bed's taken.

159
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:34,856
What?

160
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:39,694
I live in a swamp. I put up signs.
I'm a terrifying ogre!

161
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,405
What do I have to do
to get a little privacy?

162
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,702
Oh, no. Oh, no.

163
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,371
No! No!

164
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,334
What?

165
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,419
-Quit it.
-Don't push.

166
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,718
What are you doing in my swamp?

167
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,220
Swamp! Swamp! Swamp!

168
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,640
Oh, dear.

169
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,188
All right, get out of here.
All of you, move it!

170
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,190
Come on! Let's go! Hapaya!
Hapaya! Hey!

171
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,233
-Quickly. Come on!
-No, no!

172
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,694
No, no. Not there. Not there.

173
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,076
Hey, don't look at me.
I didn't invite them.

174
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,244
Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

175
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,914
-What?
-We were forced to come here.

176
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:35,124
-By who?
-Lord Farquaad.

177
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:39,962
He huffed und he puffed
und he signed an eviction notice.

178
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,757
All right.

179
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,095
Who knows where
this Farquaad guy is?

180
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,972
do. I know where he is.

181
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,768
Does anyone else
know where to find him?

182
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,480
-Anyone at all?
-Me! Me!

183
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,482
-Anyone?
-Pick me!

184
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,984
I know! I know! Me, me!

185
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:05,196
Okay, fine.

186
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,159
Attention, all fairy tale things.

187
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:14,622
Do not get comfortable.
Your welcome is officially worn out.

188
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,417
In fact, I'm gonna see
this guy Farquaad right now,

189
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,629
and get you all off my land
and back where you came from!

190
00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,142
You! You're comin' with me.

191
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,686
All right, that's what I like to hear, man.

192
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,440
Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends,
off on a whirlwind, big-city adventure.

193
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,525
love it!

194
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,277
On the road again

195
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,778
-Sing it with me, Shrek.
-Hey.

196
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,197
I can't wait to get
On the road again

197
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,491
What did I say about singing?

198
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:51,826
-Well, can I whistle?
-No.

199
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,704
-Can I hum it?
-All right, hum it.

200
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,528
That's enough. He's ready to talk.

201
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,919
"Run, run, run, as fast as you can.

202
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:46,547
"You can't catch me.
I'm the gingerbread man!"

203
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:50,218
-You're a monster.
-I'm not the monster here. You are.

204
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:54,972
You, and the rest of that fairy tale
trash, poisoning my perfect world.

205
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,557
Now, tell me! Where are the others?

206
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,434
Eat me!

207
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,188
I've tried to be fair to you creatures.

208
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,775
Now my patience has reached its end!
Tell me or I'll...

209
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,986
No, no, not the buttons.
Not my gumdrop buttons.

210
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,738
All right, then. Who's hiding them?

211
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:16,160
Okay, I'll tell you.
Do you know the muffin man?

212
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:18,579
-The muffin man?
-The muffin man.

213
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,083
Yes, I know the muffin man,
who lives on Drury Lane?

214
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:25,586
Well, she's married to the muffin man.

215
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,797
-The muffin man?
-The muffin man!

216
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,883
She's married to the muffin man.

217
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,635
My lord! We found it.

218
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,930
Well, then what are you waiting for?
Bring it in.

219
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,282
-Magic Mirror...
-Don't tell him anything!

220
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,659
No!

221
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,496
'Evening.

222
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,456
Mirror, Mirror, on the wall,

223
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,918
is this not the most
perfect kingdom of them all?

224
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,587
Well, technically, you're not a king.

225
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,464
"helonious.

226
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,803
-You were saying?
-What I mean is, you're not a king yet.

227
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,473
But you can become one.
All you have to do is marry a princess.

228
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,517
Go on.

229
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,272
So, just sit back and relax, my lord,

230
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,651
because it's time for you to meet
today's eligible bachelorettes.

231
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,195
And here they are!

232
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,239
Bachelorette number one

233
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:39,368
is a mentally abused shut-in
from a kingdom far, far away.

234
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,704
She likes sushi and hot-tubbing anytime.

235
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,249
Her hobbies include cooking
and cleaning for her two evil sisters.

236
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,710
Please welcome Cinderella.

237
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,254
Bachelorette number two
is a cape-wearing girl

238
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,839
from the land of fancy.

239
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,634
Although she lives with
seven other men, she's not easy.

240
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,262
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

241
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,475
Come on. Give it up for Snow White!

242
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,810
And last, but certainly not least,

243
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,896
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead

244
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,523
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot, boiling lava!

245
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,193
But don't let that cool you off.
She's a loaded pistol

246
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,904
who likes pina coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

247
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,158
Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona!

248
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,577
So, will it be bachelorette number one,

249
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,164
bachelorette number two
or bachelorette number three?

250
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,416
-Two! Two!
-Three! Three!

251
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,834
-Two! Two!
-Three!

252
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,045
Three? One? Three?

253
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,172
Three! Pick number three, my lord!

254
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,009
Okay, okay, number three!

255
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:41,889
Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

256
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:51,399
Princess Fiona. She's perfect.

257
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,859
All I have to do is
just find someone who can go...

258
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,570
But I probably should mention
the little thing that happens at night.

259
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,572
-I'll do it.
-Yes, but after sunset...

260
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:02,743
Silence! I will make
this Princess Fiona my queen,

261
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,997
and Duloc will finally
have the perfect king!

262
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,291
Captain, assemble your finest men.

263
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:13,170
We're going to have a tournament.

264
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:18,384
But that's it. That's it right there.
That's Duloc.

265
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,052
I told ya I'd find it.

266
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:24,265
So, that must be
Lord Farquaad's castle.

267
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,434
That's the place.

268
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,729
Do you think maybe
he's compensating for something?

269
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,152
Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

270
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,113
Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.

271
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,617
Hey, you!

272
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,163
Wait a second.
Look, I'm not gonna eat ya.

273
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,874
I just... I just...

274
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,282
It's quiet.

275
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,995
Too quiet.

276
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:34,710
-Where is everybody?
-Hey, look at this!

277
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,519
Welcome to Duloc
Such a perfect town

278
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:55,314
Here we have some rules
Let us lay them down

279
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,984
Don't make waves, stay in line
And we'll get along fine

280
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:02,696
Duloc is a perfect place

281
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:07,326
Please keep off of the grass
Shine your shoes, wipe your face

282
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,996
Duloc is, Duloc is

283
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,918
Duloc is a perfect place

284
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,842
Wow.

285
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:28,764
-Let's do that again!
-No. No. No, no, no! No.

286
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,477
Brave knights.

287
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:37,773
You are the best and brightest
in all the land.

288
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,276
Today, one of you shall prove himself...

289
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,862
All right. You're going the right way
for a smacked bottom.

290
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,738
Sorry about that.

291
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:50,327
That champion shall have the honour...
No, no, the privilege

292
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:54,415
to go forth and rescue
the lovely Princess Fiona

293
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,835
from the fiery keep of the dragon.

294
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:02,131
If for any reason
the winner is unsuccessful,

295
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,384
the first runner-up will take his place

296
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,262
and so on and so forth.

297
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:14,018
Some of you may die,
but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make.

298
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,442
Let the tournament begin!

299
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,824
What is that?

300
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:34,330
-It's hideous!
-That's not very nice.

301
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,458
It's just a donkey.

302
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,502
Indeed. Knights, new plan!

303
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:45,299
The one who kills the ogre
will be named champion! Have at him!

304
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,345
-Get him!
-Hey! Now, come on! Hang on now.

305
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,680
Go ahead! Get him!

306
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:55,434
Can't we just settle this over a pint?

307
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,769
Kill the beast!

308
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,105
No? All right then.

309
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,484
Come on!

310
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:20,542
Damn!

311
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,350
Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

312
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,235
Yeah!

313
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,406
The chair! Give him the chair!

314
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,428
Oh, yeah!

315
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:16,598
Thank you!

316
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:20,644
Thank you very much!
I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal!

317
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,986
Shall I give the order, sir?

318
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:32,656
No, I have a better idea.

319
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,911
People of Duloc,
I give you our champion!

320
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:41,874
-What?
-Congratulations, ogre.

321
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:46,295
You've won the honour of embarking
on a great and noble quest.

322
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:50,758
Quest? I'm already on a quest,
a quest to get my swamp back.

323
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:54,052
-Your swamp?
-Yeah, my swamp!

324
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:56,638
Where you dumped
those fairy tale creatures!

325
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,435
Indeed. All right, ogre,
I'll make you a deal.

326
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,314
Go on this quest for me,
and I'll give you your swamp back.

327
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,108
Exactly the way it was?

328
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,944
Down to the last
slime-covered toadstool.

329
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:14,281
-And the squatters?
-As good as gone.

330
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,121
What kind of quest?

331
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,957
Okay, let me get this straight.
You're gonna go fight a dragon

332
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,752
and rescue a princess just so
Farquaad will give you back a swamp,

333
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,755
which you only don't have because
he filled it full of freaks in the first place.

334
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,423
-Is that about right?
-You know what?

335
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,301
Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

336
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:37,763
I don't get it, Shrek. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

337
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,932
You know, throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress,

338
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,851
grind his bones to make your bread,
the whole ogre trip.

339
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,853
know what.

340
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,439
Maybe I could have
decapitated an entire village

341
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:49,358
and put their heads on a pike,

342
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,070
gotten a knife, cut open their spleen
and drink their fluids.

343
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,280
Does that sound good to you?

344
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,991
No, not really, no.

345
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,870
For your information, there's a lot more
to ogres than people think.

346
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,706
-Example?
-Example?

347
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,128
Okay, ogres are like onions.

348
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,797
-They stink?
-Yes. No!

349
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,298
-They make you cry?
-No!

350
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:15,384
You leave them out in the sun,
they get all brown,

351
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,802
start sproutin' little, white hairs.

352
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,887
No! Layers!

353
00:27:18,971 --> 00:27:21,306
Onions have layers.

354
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,685
Ogres have layers! Onions have layers.

355
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,187
You get it? We both have layers.

356
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,067
You both have layers.

357
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:36,154
You know, not everybody likes onions.

358
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,866
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

359
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:42,870
I don't care what everyone likes.

360
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:46,665
Ogres are not like cakes.

361
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,086
You know what else
everybody likes? Parfaits.

362
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,755
Have you ever met a person,
you say, "Let's get some parfait,"

363
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,341
they say, "No, I don't like no parfait"?
Parfaits are delicious.

364
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:00,679
No! You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

365
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,473
Ogres are like onions! End of story.

366
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:06,393
Bye-bye. See ya later.

367
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:14,067
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

368
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:17,154
You know, I think I preferred
your humming.

369
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,907
Do you have a tissue or something?
'Cause I'm making a mess.

370
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,910
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

371
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,660
Shrek! Did you do that?

372
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,287
Man, you gotta warn somebody
before you just crack one off.

373
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,665
-My mouth was open and everything.
-Believe me, Donkey,

374
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,334
if it was me, you'd be dead.

375
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,170
It's brimstone.

376
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:18,423
-We must be getting close.
-Yeah, right, brimstone.

377
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,133
Don't be talking about it's the brimstone.

378
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:22,594
I know what I smell.
It wasn't no brimstone.

379
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,638
It didn't come off no stone neither.

380
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:45,993
Sure, it's big enough,
but look at the location.

381
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,331
Shrek?

382
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:54,793
Remember when you said
that ogres have layers?

383
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:55,961
Aye.

384
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:59,506
Well, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

385
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,133
Donkeys don't have layers.

386
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,968
We wear our fear right out there
on our sleeves.

387
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,846
Wait a second.
Donkeys don't have sleeves.

388
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,139
You know what I mean.

389
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,891
You can't tell me
you're afraid of heights.

390
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,811
No, I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on a rickety bridge

391
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,563
over a boiling lake of lava!

392
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,692
Come on, Donkey.
I'm right here beside ya, okay?

393
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,445
For emotional support,

394
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:26,074
we'll just tackle this thing together
one little baby step at a time.

395
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,076
-Really?
-Really, really.

396
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,162
Okay, that makes me feel
so much better.

397
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,371
Just keep moving.

398
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:36,043
-And don't look down.
-Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.

399
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,504
Don't look down.
Keep on moving. Don't look down.

400
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,383
Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

401
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,386
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off right now. Please.

402
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,015
-But you're already halfway.
-But I know that half is safe!

403
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,893
Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back.

404
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,395
-Shrek, no! Wait!
-Just, Donkey...

405
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:58,565
-Let's have a dance then, shall we?
-Don't do that!

406
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:02,527
I'm sorry. Do what?

407
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,697
-This?
-Yes, that!

408
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,242
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

409
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,578
No, Shrek!

410
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,790
-No! Stop it!
-You said do it! I'm doin1 it.

411
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,127
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

412
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,800
That'll do, Donkey. That'll do.

413
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,847
Cool.

414
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,267
So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

415
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:38,105
Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.

416
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:41,108
I was talkin1 about the dragon, Shrek.

417
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,500
You afraid?

418
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,877
No, but...

419
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,297
Good. Me, neither.

420
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,969
'Cause there's nothin'
wrong with bein' afraid.

421
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,305
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

422
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,432
Unfamiliar dangerous situation,
I might add.

423
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,144
With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,

424
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,770
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward

425
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,689
if you're a little scared,
you know what I mean?

426
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,191
'Cause I sure as heck ain't no coward.
I know that.

427
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:28,196
Donkey, two things, okay?

428
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,324
Shut up.

429
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:33,660
Now, go over there
and see if you can find any stairs.

430
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,371
Stairs? I thought we was lookin'
for the princess.

431
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:41,334
The princess will be up the stairs
in the highest room in the tallest tower.

432
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,005
-What makes you think she'll be there?
-I read it in a book once.

433
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:49,009
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

434
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,137
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt, too.

435
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,181
That's right. Those stairs won't know
which way they're goin'.

436
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,645
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

437
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,523
Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me.
I'm the stair master.

438
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:06,401
I've mastered the stairs.
I wish I had a step right here.

439
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:07,944
I'd step all over it.

440
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,701
Well, at least we know
where the princess is, but where's the...

441
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,870
Dragon!

442
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:34,888
Donkey, look out!

443
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,944
Got ya!

444
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,981
No. Oh, no. No!

445
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,317
Oh, what large teeth you have.

446
00:34:31,528 --> 00:34:33,029
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.

447
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,365
I know you probably hear this
all the time from your food,

448
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,741
but you must bleach or something,

449
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,411
'cause that is one dazzling smile
you got there.

450
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,163
Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

451
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,082
And you know what else?
You know what else?

452
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,002
You're... You're a girl dragon!

453
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,590
Sure. I mean,
of course you're a girl dragon.

454
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:55,468
'Cause you're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

455
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,887
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

456
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,310
Man, I'd really love to stay,
but, you know, I'm...

457
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,270
I'm an asthmatic,
and I don't know if it'd work out

458
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,480
if you're gonna blow smoke rings
and stuff.

459
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,357
Shrek!

460
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:15,071
No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

461
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,856
-Wake up!
-What?

462
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,566
Are you Princess Fiona?

463
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,361
am.

464
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,988
Awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

465
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,074
That's nice. Now, let's go.

466
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,159
But wait, Sir Knight.

467
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,536
This be-eth our first meeting.

468
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,332
Should it not be a wonderful,
romantic moment?

469
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,753
-Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
-Hey, wait. What are you doing?

470
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,922
You should sweep me off my feet,

471
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,384
out yonder window and down a rope
onto your valiant steed.

472
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,261
You've had a lot of time to plan this,
haven't you?

473
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,560
But we have to savour this moment!

474
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,397
You could recite an epic poem for me.

475
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,941
A ballad? A sonnet!

476
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:36,277
-A limerick? Or something!
-I don't think so.

477
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,782
Can I at least know
the name of my champion?

478
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,784
Shrek.

479
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:46,579
Sir Shrek.

480
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:51,418
I pray that you take this favour
as a token of my gratitude.

481
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,546
"hanks!

482
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,385
You didn't slay the dragon?

483
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,929
It's on my to-do list. Now, come on!

484
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,098
But this isn't right!

485
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:08,476
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

486
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,103
That's what all the other knights did.

487
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,480
Yeah, right before they burst into flame.

488
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,482
That's not the point.

489
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,653
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

490
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,780
Well, I have to save my ass.

491
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:24,075
What kind of knight are you?

492
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,578
One of a kind.

493
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,038
Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

494
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,666
I believe it's healthy
to get to know someone

495
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:35,295
over a long period of time.
Just call me old-fashioned.

496
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,591
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

497
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,136
I'm not emotionally ready
for a commitment of this

498
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,513
magnitude, really,
is the word I'm looking for.

499
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:49,100
Magnitude. Hey,
that is unwanted physical contact.

500
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,644
Hey, what are you doing?

501
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,981
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little
and take this one step at a time.

502
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,901
We really should get to know each other
first as friends,

503
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,194
or maybe even as pen pals.

504
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:03,490
'Cause I'm on the road a lot,
but I just love receiving cards...

505
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,992
Hey, you know,
I'd really love to stay, but...

506
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,661
Hey, hey, don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

507
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,080
You're gonna tear it off.
I don't give permission to...

508
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:12,332
What are you gonna do with that?

509
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,044
Hey, now. No way. No! No!

510
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,880
No, no! No. No, no, no! No!

511
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,700
-Hi, Princess!
-It talks!

512
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:51,538
Yeah, it's getting him to shut up
that's the trick.

513
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,033
Okay, you two, head for the exit!

514
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,913
I'll take care of the dragon.

515
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,462
Run!

516
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,970
You did it!

517
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,932
You rescued me!
You're amazing. You're...

518
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,769
You're wonderful. You're...

519
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,146
A little unorthodox, I'll admit.

520
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:45,151
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

521
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,445
I am eternally in your debt.

522
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:53,451
And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

523
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,871
All right, I hope you heard that.
She called me a noble steed.

524
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:58,206
She think I'm a steed.

525
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,459
"he battle is won.

526
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,045
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

527
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,714
-No.
-Why not?

528
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,008
have helmet hair.

529
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:12,303
Please. I would'st look
upon the face of my rescuer.

530
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,973
No, no, you wouldn't'st.

531
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,517
But how will you kiss me?

532
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,396
What? That wasn't
in the job description.

533
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,815
Maybe it's a perk.

534
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:28,319
No, it's destiny.
You must know how it goes.

535
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:32,198
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon

536
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,201
is rescued by a brave knight,

537
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:38,579
and then they share true love's first kiss.

538
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,748
With Shrek? You think... Wait.

539
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:44,002
Wait. Wait a second.
You think that Shrek is your true love?

540
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,087
Well, yes.

541
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:52,593
You think Shrek is your true love!

542
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,595
What is so funny?

543
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,765
Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

544
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:01,352
Of course you are. You're my rescuer.

545
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:03,896
Now... Now, remove your helmet.

546
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,190
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

547
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,276
-Just take off the helmet.
-I'm not going to.

548
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,527
-Take it off.
-No!

549
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,696
-Now!
-Okay!

550
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:16,284
Easy. As you command, Your Highness.

551
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,797
You... You're an ogre.

552
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,760
You were expecting Prince Charming.

553
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,345
Well, yes, actually.

554
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:43,936
Oh, no. This is all wrong.
You're not supposed to be an ogre.

555
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,233
Princess, I was sent to rescue you
by Lord Farquaad, okay?

556
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:51,235
He's the one who wants to marry you.

557
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,237
Well, then why didn't he come
rescue me?

558
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:57,658
Good question. You should ask him that
when we get there.

559
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:03,581
But I have to be rescued by my true love,
not by some ogre and his pet.

560
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,750
So much for noble steed.

561
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,461
Look, Princess, you're not making
my job any easier.

562
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,923
Well, I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

563
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:17,261
You can tell Lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

564
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:19,680
I'll be waiting for him right here.

565
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:24,811
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

566
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,146
You wouldn't dare.

567
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,607
-Put me down!
-Ya comin', Donkey?

568
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,275
Yeah, I'm right behind ya.

569
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,946
Put me down,
or you will suffer the consequences!

570
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,782
This is not dignified! Put me down!

571
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,038
Okay, so here's another question.
Say there's a woman that digs you, right,

572
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,623
but you don't really like her that way.

573
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,084
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

574
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,670
but you don't get burned to a crisp
and eaten? How do you do that?

575
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,506
You just tell her she's not your true love.

576
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,300
Everyone knowest what happens
when you find your...

577
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,094
Hey!

578
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:01,347
The sooner we get to Duloc the better.

579
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,350
Yeah, you're gonna love it there,
Princess. It's beautiful!

580
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:08,187
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

581
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,398
Let me put it this way, Princess.

582
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:15,319
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

583
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:20,658
I don't know, Shrek.
There are those who think little of him.

584
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,663
Stop it. Stop it, both of you.

585
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,957
You know, you're just jealous you can
never measure up

586
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,710
to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

587
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,713
Yeah, well,
maybe you're right, Princess.

588
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:37,091
But I'll let you do the "measuring"
when you see him tomorrow.

589
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:41,387
Tomorrow? It'll take that long?

590
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:46,184
-Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
-No, that'll take longer.

591
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,730
-We can keep going.
-But there's robbers in the woods.

592
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:54,108
Time-out, Shrek! Camping's definitely
starting to sound good.

593
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:58,279
Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything
we're going to see in this forest.

594
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,740
I need to find somewhere to camp now!

595
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,709
-Hey! Over here.
-Shrek, we can do better than that.

596
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,378
Now, I don't think
this is fit for a princess.

597
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:17,590
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

598
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:22,303
Homey touches? Like what?

599
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,432
A door?
Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night.

600
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,060
You want me to come in there and read
you a bedtime story? Because I will.

601
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,020
I said good night!

602
00:45:34,315 --> 00:45:35,900
Shrek, what are you doing?

603
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:40,446
I... You know... Come on.
I was just kidding.

604
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:50,623
And that one, that's Throwback,

605
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,126
the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

606
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,338
Right. Yeah.

607
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,299
Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?

608
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:04,178
Well, the stars don't tell the future,
Donkey. They tell stories.

609
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:09,767
Look, there's Bloodnut, the flatulent.
You can guess what he's famous for.

610
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,477
All right, now I know
you're making this up.

611
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,146
No, look. There he is,

612
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:17,316
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

613
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,986
Man, that ain't nothin'
but a bunch of little dots.

614
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:24,365
You know, Donkey, sometimes things
are more than they appear.

615
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,702
Forget it.

616
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,959
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

617
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,460
Our swamp?

618
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:39,255
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess and all that stuff.

619
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:43,384
We? Donkey, there's no we.
There's no our.

620
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,178
There's just me and my swamp.

621
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:50,516
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a 10-foot wall around my land.

622
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:54,729
You cut me deep, Shrek.
You cut me real deep just now.

623
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,065
You know what I think?

624
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:01,736
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

625
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:05,990
-No, do ya think?
-Are you hidin' something?

626
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,117
Never mind, Donkey.

627
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,495
This is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

628
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,458
No, this is one of those
drop-it-and-leave-it-alone things.

629
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,045
-Why don't you want to talk about it?
-Why do you want to talk about it?

630
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:20,921
-Why are you blocking?
-I'm not blocking.

631
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,174
-Yes, you are.
-Donkey, I'm warning you.

632
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,217
Who you trying to keep out?
Just tell me that, Shrek. Who?

633
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:27,428
Everyone! Okay?

634
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,264
Now we're gettin' somewhere.

635
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,517
For the love of Pete!

636
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,437
What's your problem, Shrek? What you
got against the whole world, anyway?

637
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,814
Look, I'm not the one
with the problem, okay?

638
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,776
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

639
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:45,863
People take one look at me
and go, "Help! Run!

640
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,199
"A big, stupid, ugly ogre!"

641
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,661
They judge me
before they even know me.

642
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,873
That's why I'm better off alone.

643
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,050
You know what?

644
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:10,054
When we met, I didn't think you was
just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

645
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:14,767
Yeah, I know.

646
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,270
So, are there any donkeys up there?

647
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:24,110
Well, there's Gabby,
the small and annoying.

648
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:29,115
Okay, okay. I see it now. The big, shiny
one, right there. That one there?

649
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,409
-That's the moon.
-Okay.

650
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,559
Again. Show me again.

651
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:04,191
Mirror, mirror, show her to me.
Show me the princess.

652
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,740
Perfect.

653
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:19,350
Yeah, you know I like it like that.

654
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:24,396
-Come on, baby. I said I like it.
-Donkey, wake up.

655
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,106
-What?
-Wake up.

656
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,610
-What?
-Morning.

657
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:32,238
How do you like your eggs?

658
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:36,033
-Good morning, Princess!
-What's all this about?

659
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:40,329
You know, we kind of got off
to a bad start yesterday.

660
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:45,793
I wanted to make it up to you.
I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

661
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,088
"hanks.

662
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:54,009
Well, eat up.
We've got a big day ahead of us.

663
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,393
-Shrek!
-What? It's a compliment.

664
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,229
Better out than in, I always say.

665
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,190
Well, it's no way to behave
in front of a princess.

666
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,986
-Thanks.
-She's as nasty as you are.

667
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,699
You know,
you're not exactly what I expected.

668
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:20,995
Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people
before you get to know them.

669
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,334
Hey!

670
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,169
Princess!

671
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,714
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

672
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:35,092
Be still, mon cherie,
for I am your saviour!

673
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:39,513
And I am rescuing you from this green

674
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,099
-beast.
-Hey!

675
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,102
That's my princess! Go find your own!

676
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:50,149
Please, monster!
Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

677
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:53,319
Look, pal, I don't know
who you think you are!

678
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:58,157
Of course! How rude.
Please, let me introduce myself.

679
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,409
Merry Men!

680
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,460
I steal from the rich
And give to the needy

681
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,587
-He takes a wee percentage
-But I'm not greedy

682
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,672
I rescue pretty damsels
Man, I'm good

683
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:16,467
-What a guy, Monsieur Hood
-Break it down

684
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,598
I like an honest fight
And a saucy little maid

685
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:23,974
What he's basically saying is
He likes to get...

686
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,059
Paid

687
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,143
So

688
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,811
When an ogre in the bush
Grabs a lady by the tush

689
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:28,979
-That's bad
-That's bad

690
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:30,314
-That's bad
-That's bad

691
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,983
When a beauty's with a beast
It makes me awfully mad

692
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,568
He's mad
He's really, really mad

693
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,654
I'll take my blade
And ram it through your heart

694
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:41,325
Keep your eyes on me, boys
'Cause I'm about to start

695
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,876
-Man, that was annoying!
-You little...

696
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,365
Shall we?

697
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,660
Hold the phone.

698
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,164
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now.

699
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,250
-Where did that come from?
-What?

700
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,545
That! Back there. That was amazing!

701
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,088
Where did you learn that?

702
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,425
Well, when one lives alone,

703
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:42,261
one has to learn these things
in case there's a...

704
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,972
-There's an arrow in your butt!
-What?

705
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:48,642
-Would you look at that?
-No. This is all my fault.

706
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,436
-I'm so sorry.
-Why? What's wrong?

707
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:53,063
-Shrek's hurt.
-Shrek's hurt. Shrek's hurt?

708
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,398
No, Shrek's gonna die.

709
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,899
Donkey, I'm okay.

710
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,277
You can't do this to me, Shrek.
I'm too young for you to die.

711
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,362
Keep your legs elevated.
Turn your head and cough.

712
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,615
-Does anyone know the Heimlich?
-Donkey! Calm down.

713
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:06,076
If you want to help Shrek,
run into the woods

714
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,245
and find me a blue flower
with red thorns.

715
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,081
Blue flower, red thorns.
Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns.

716
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:12,124
Blue flower, red thorns.

717
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,377
Don't die, Shrek. And if you see
a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

718
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,545
-Donkey!
-Donkey!

719
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:18,505
Yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns.

720
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:21,008
-Blue flower, red thorns.
-What are the flowers for?

721
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,302
For getting rid of Donkey.

722
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,637
Now, you hold still,
and I'll yank this thing out.

723
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,598
Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

724
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:31,226
-I'm sorry, but it has to come out.
-No, it's tender.

725
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,769
Now, hold on.

726
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,104
What you're doing is the opposite
of help.

727
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,606
Don't move.

728
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,524
-Look, look, time-out.
-Would you...

729
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:42,196
Okay. What do you propose we do?

730
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,907
Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower,
red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns.

731
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,326
This would be so much easier
if I wasn't colour blind!

732
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,495
Blue flower, red thorns.
Blue flower, red thorns.

733
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:51,663
Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'!

734
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,626
Not good.

735
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:59,213
Okay. Okay, I can nearly see the head.
It's just about...

736
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:08,305
Nothing happened. We were just...

737
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,558
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask, okay?

738
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:15,187
Come on!
That's the last thing on my mind.

739
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:18,941
The princess here was just...

740
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:27,324
Hey, what's that? That's...
Is that blood?

741
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,779
Hey!

742
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,958
There it is, Princess.

743
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,461
Your future awaits you.

744
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,838
-That's Duloc?
-Yeah, I know.

745
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,424
You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's
compensating for something,

746
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,135
which I think means he has a really...

747
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,137
I...

748
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:15,932
-I guess we better move on.
-Sure. But, Shrek?

749
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:19,686
I'm worried about Donkey.

750
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,147
-What?
-I mean, look at him.

751
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,233
-He doesn't look so good.
-What are you talking about? I'm fine.

752
00:57:25,317 --> 00:57:26,818
Well, that's what they always say,

753
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:29,404
and then next thing you know,
you're on your back.

754
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,908
-Dead.
-You know, she's right.

755
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,827
You look awful.
Do you want to sit down?

756
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,622
-You know, I'll make you some tea.
-I didn't want to say nothin',

757
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,625
but I got this twinge in my neck,
and when I turn my head like this, look.

758
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,585
-See?
-Who's hungry?

759
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:46,004
-I'll find us some dinner.
-I'll get the firewood.

760
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:50,717
Hey, where you goin'?
Man, I can't feel my toes!

761
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,260
I don't have any toes!

762
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,263
I think I need a hug.

763
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:05,857
This is good. This is really good.

764
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:10,070
-What is this?
-Weed rat.

765
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,239
Rotisserie style.

766
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,907
No kidding.

767
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,743
Well, this is delicious.

768
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:18,995
Well, they're also great in stews.

769
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:23,750
Now, I don't mean to brag,
but I make a mean weedrat stew.

770
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:31,008
I guess I'll be dining
a little differently tomorrow night.

771
00:58:32,676 --> 00:58:36,471
Maybe you can
come visit me in the swamp sometime.

772
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,598
I'll cook all kinds of stuff for you.

773
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:42,561
Swamp-toad soup, fish-eye tartare,
you name it.

774
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:45,939
I'd like that.

775
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:02,456
-Princess?
-Yes, Shrek?

776
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:07,836
I was wondering. Are you...

777
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:14,301
Are you gonna eat that?

778
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,853
Man, isn't this romantic?
Just look at that sunset.

779
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:29,691
Sunset? No! I mean, it's late.
It's very late.

780
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,276
-What?
-Wait a minute.

781
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,278
I see what's goin' on here.

782
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,281
-You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?
-Yes!

783
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:40,118
Yes, that's it. I'm terrified.
You know what, I'd better go inside.

784
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:43,914
Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to
be afraid of the dark, too, until...

785
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,666
Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

786
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:51,671
-Good night.
-Good night.

787
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,970
Now I really see what's goin' on here.

788
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:00,764
What are you talkin' about?

789
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,350
I don't even wanna hear it.
Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts.

790
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,644
I know you two were
diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

791
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,439
You're crazy.
I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

792
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,651
Come on, Shrek.
Wake up and smell the pheromones.

793
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,403
-Just go on in and tell her how you feel.
-I...

794
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:19,491
There's nothing to tell.
Besides, even if I did tell her that,

795
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:25,080
well, you know...
And I'm not sayin' I do, 'cause I don't...

796
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,624
She's a princess, and I'm...

797
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:32,379
-An ogre?
-Yeah. An ogre.

798
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:37,509
-Hey, where you goin'7
-To get more firewood.

799
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,031
Princess? Princess Fiona?

800
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:07,330
Princess, where are you?

801
01:01:12,961 --> 01:01:14,796
Princess?

802
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,887
It's very spooky in here.
I ain't playing no games.

803
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,900
-No! No!
-No, help!

804
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:37,611
-Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

805
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:40,780
-What did you do with the princess?
-Donkey, I'm the princess.

806
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,241
It's me, in this body.

807
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:45,869
Oh, my God! You ate the princess!

808
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:47,704
-Can you hear me?
-Donkey!

809
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,539
-Listen, keep breathing!
-No!

810
01:01:49,623 --> 01:01:52,834
I'll get you out of there!
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

811
01:01:52,918 --> 01:01:55,337
-Shrek!
-This is me.

812
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:03,011
Princess?

813
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:08,058
What happened to you?
You're different.

814
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,769
-I'm ugly, okay?
-Well, yeah.

815
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,897
Was it something that you ate? 'Cause
I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea.

816
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,524
-You are what you eat, I said. Now...
-No.

817
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,945
I've been this way
as long as I can remember.

818
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:22,697
What do you mean? Look,
I ain't never seen you like this before.

819
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,492
It only happens
when the sun goes down.

820
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:32,540
"By night one way, by day another.
This shall be the norm

821
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:38,922
"until you find true love's first kiss
and then take love's true form."

822
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:44,260
That's beautiful.
I didn't know you wrote poetry.

823
01:02:44,344 --> 01:02:47,389
It's a spell.

824
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:51,977
When I was a little girl,
a witch cast a spell on me.

825
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,354
Every night I become this,

826
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,149
this horrible, ugly beast.

827
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:05,615
I was placed in a tower to await the day
my true love would rescue me.

828
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,410
That's why I have to marry
Lord Farquaad tomorrow

829
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:13,748
before the sun sets
and he sees me like this.

830
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:19,337
All right, all right. Calm down.
Look, it's not that bad.

831
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:23,591
You're not that ugly.
Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly.

832
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:26,678
But you only look like this at night.
Shrek's ugly 24-7.

833
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:30,306
But, Donkey, I'm a princess,

834
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,101
and this is not how a princess
is meant to look.

835
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,689
Princess, how 'bout if you
don't marry Farquaad?

836
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,649
have to.

837
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:42,569
Only my true love's kiss
can break the spell.

838
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:46,197
But, you know, you're kind of an ogre,

839
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:49,534
and Shrek, well,
you got a lot in common.

840
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,328
Shrek?

841
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,332
Princess, I... How's it going, first of all?

842
01:03:55,415 --> 01:03:59,669
Good? Good for me, too. I'm okay.

843
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:05,050
I saw this flower and thought of you
because it's pretty and...

844
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:08,511
Well, I don't really like it,
but I thought you might like it

845
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:13,391
'cause you're pretty.
But I like you anyway. I'd...

846
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,688
I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

847
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,982
I can't just marry whoever I want.

848
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,526
Take a good look at me, Donkey.

849
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,362
I mean, really,

850
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:28,406
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

851
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:30,617
Princess and ugly don't go together.

852
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,119
That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

853
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:37,624
My only chance to live happily
ever after is to marry my true love.

854
01:04:39,084 --> 01:04:42,962
Don't you see, Donkey?
That's just how it has to be.

855
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,884
It's the only way to break the spell.

856
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,803
You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

857
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,181
No! You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

858
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,809
What's the point of being able to talk
if you gotta keep secrets?

859
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,353
Promise you won't tell. Promise!

860
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,272
All right, all right. I won't tell him.
But you should.

861
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,650
I just know before this is over,
I'm gonna need

862
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,653
a whole lot of serious therapy.
Look at my eye twitch in'.

863
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:35,098
I tell him, I tell him not.

864
01:05:36,516 --> 01:05:39,018
I tell him, I tell him not.

865
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,688
tell him.

866
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:46,526
Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want...

867
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,507
Shrek.

868
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:15,013
-Are you all right?
-Perfect! Never been better.

869
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,349
I... I don't...
There's something I have to tell you.

870
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:21,019
You don't have to tell me
anything, Princess.

871
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,771
-I heard enough last night.
-You heard what I said?

872
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,648
Every word.

873
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,150
I thought you'd understand.

874
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,985
understand.

875
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:33,114
Like you said, "Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?"

876
01:06:34,073 --> 01:06:35,867
But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

877
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,994
Yeah? Well, it does.

878
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,749
Right on time.

879
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,543
Princess, I've brought you
a little something.

880
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:53,551
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

881
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,262
Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

882
01:06:57,639 --> 01:06:59,766
Princess Fiona.

883
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,894
As promised. Now, hand it over.

884
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:07,482
Very well, ogre. The deed
to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

885
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,985
Take it and go
before I change my mind.

886
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:14,280
Forgive me, Princess, for startling you,

887
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,783
but you startled me,

888
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:20,536
for I have never seen
such a radiant beauty before.

889
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,706
I am Lord Farquaad.

890
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:27,627
Lord Farquaad? No, no.

891
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,464
Forgive me, my lord,
for I was just saying a short

892
01:07:34,801 --> 01:07:36,177
farewell.

893
01:07:36,261 --> 01:07:41,266
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

894
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,476
It's not like it has feelings.

895
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:46,938
No, you're right. It doesn't.

896
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:51,025
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair,
flawless Fiona.

897
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:54,362
I ask your hand in marriage.

898
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:58,324
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

899
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:07,875
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

900
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:11,212
Excellent! I'll start the plans,
for tomorrow we wed!

901
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:15,550
No! I mean, why wait?

902
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:19,345
Let's get married today before sunset.

903
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,140
Anxious, are we? You're right.

904
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:26,144
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

905
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,563
There's the caterer,
the cake, the band, the guest list.

906
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:32,066
Captain, round up some guests!

907
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,652
Fare thee well, ogre.

908
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:36,988
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

909
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:38,573
Yeah? So what?

910
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,533
Shrek, there's something about her
you don't know.

911
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,410
Look, I talked to her last night. She's...

912
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:46,956
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

913
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,376
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

914
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,420
Shrek, I wanna go with you.

915
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,465
I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me.

916
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:59,636
I live alone!
My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

917
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,679
Understand? Nobody!

918
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:06,601
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

919
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,854
-But I thought...
-Yeah. You know what?

920
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,606
You thought wrong!

921
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,276
Shrek.

922
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:40,630
Donkey? What are you doing?

923
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,841
I would think, of all people, you would
recognise a wall when you see one.

924
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:45,593
Well, yeah.

925
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:49,096
But the wall's supposed
to go around my swamp, not through it.

926
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,974
It is around your half.
See, that's your half, and this is my half.

927
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,685
Your half.

928
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,396
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.

929
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,607
I did half the work, I get half the booty.

930
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:03,236
Now, hand me that big, old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

931
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,613
-Back off!
-No, you back off.

932
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,990
-This is my swamp!
-Our swamp.

933
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:09,325
-Let go, Donkey!
-You let go.

934
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:11,494
-Stubborn jackass!
-Smelly ogre.

935
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,788
Fine!

936
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:15,748
Hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you yet.

937
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:17,500
Well, I'm through with you.

938
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:20,628
You know, with you, it's always,
"Me, me, me!"

939
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:25,508
Well, guess what! Now it's my turn!
So, you just shut up and pay attention!

940
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,385
You are mean to me.

941
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:30,179
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

942
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,849
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

943
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:37,228
Yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?

944
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,523
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

945
01:12:40,856 --> 01:12:43,818
Yeah. You're right, Donkey.

946
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:48,114
I forgive you
for stabbin' me in the back!

947
01:12:48,698 --> 01:12:52,118
You're so wrapped up in layers,
onion boy,

948
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,619
you're afraid of your own feelings.

949
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:54,787
Go away!

950
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:57,456
See, there you are, doing it again
just like you did to Fiona.

951
01:12:57,540 --> 01:12:59,834
All she ever do was like you,
maybe even love you.

952
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:04,338
Love me?
She said I was ugly, a hideous creature.

953
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:06,090
I heard the two of you talking.

954
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:10,094
She wasn't talkin' about you.
She was talkin' about somebody else.

955
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:16,183
She wasn't talking about me?

956
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,810
Well, then who was she talking about?

957
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:21,314
No way. I ain't saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me, right?

958
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,108
-Right? No!
-Donkey!

959
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:27,695
Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right?

960
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:36,120
I'm sorry.

961
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:40,458
I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

962
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,336
Can you forgive me?

963
01:13:46,047 --> 01:13:47,923
Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

964
01:13:48,007 --> 01:13:52,511
-Right. Friends?
-Friends.

965
01:13:53,346 --> 01:13:57,892
So, what did Fiona say about me?

966
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,729
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

967
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:04,273
The wedding!
We'll never make it in time.

968
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:09,028
Never fear, for where there's a will,
there's a way, and I have a way.

969
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,535
Donkey?

970
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:19,080
I guess it's just my animal magnetism.

971
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:23,000
-Come here, you.
-All right, all right.

972
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:25,127
Don't get all slobbery.
No one likes a kiss-ass.

973
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,755
All right, hop on and hold on tight.

974
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,924
I haven't had a chance
to install the seat belts yet.

975
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,834
People of Duloc,

976
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:10,423
we gather here today to bear witness

977
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:14,969
-to the union of our new king.
-Excuse me.

978
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:18,264
Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

979
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,765
Go on.

980
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,315
Go ahead, have some fun. If we
need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

981
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:33,112
Shrek, wait, wait! Hey! Wait a minute!

982
01:15:33,195 --> 01:15:35,698
-You wanna do this right, don't you?
-What are you talking about?

983
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,324
There's a line you gotta wait for.

984
01:15:37,408 --> 01:15:39,952
The priest is gonna say,
"Speak now or forever hold your peace."

985
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,371
And that's when you say, "I object!"

986
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:44,039
don't have time for this!

987
01:15:44,123 --> 01:15:46,042
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

988
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,793
-Look, you love this woman, don't you?
-Yes.

989
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,295
-You wanna hold her?
-Yes.

990
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,546
-Please her?
-Yes!

991
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:54,300
Then you got to, got to try
a little tenderness

992
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:55,676
The chicks love that romantic crap!

993
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,971
All right! Cut it out.
When does this guy say the line?

994
01:15:59,805 --> 01:16:01,223
We gotta check it out.

995
01:16:01,307 --> 01:16:05,394
-And so, by the power vested in me...
-What do you see?

996
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,063
"he whole town's in there.

997
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:10,274
-I now pronounce you husband...
-They're at the altar.

998
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:13,611
-...and wife, king and queen.
-Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

999
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,529
For the love of Pete!

1000
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:19,617
I object!

1001
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:23,454
-Shrek?
-Now what does he want?

1002
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:31,003
Hi, everyone.
Havin' a good time, are ya?

1003
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:33,255
I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

1004
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:34,757
What are you doing here?

1005
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,968
Really, it's rude enough
being alive when no one wants you,

1006
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:41,388
-but showing up uninvited to a wedding.
-Fiona!

1007
01:16:41,472 --> 01:16:44,475
-I need to talk to you.
-Now you wanna talk?

1008
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:47,394
Well, it's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me.

1009
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:49,980
-But you can't marry him.
-And why not?

1010
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:54,068
Because, because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

1011
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:56,570
Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

1012
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,990
-He's not your true love.
-And what do you know about true love?

1013
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:03,118
Well, I...

1014
01:17:03,202 --> 01:17:06,038
-I mean...
-This is precious.

1015
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,793
The ogre has fallen in love
with the princess!

1016
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,211
Good Lord.

1017
01:17:13,504 --> 01:17:15,130
An ogre and a princess!

1018
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:23,430
Shrek, is this true?

1019
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:27,309
Who cares? It's preposterous!

1020
01:17:27,393 --> 01:17:30,938
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away
from our "happily ever after."

1021
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:33,065
Now, kiss me!

1022
01:17:37,695 --> 01:17:41,031
"By night one way, by day another."

1023
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,244
I wanted to show you before.

1024
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:12,897
Well, that explains a lot.

1025
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,817
It's disgusting!

1026
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,694
Guards! Guards!

1027
01:18:18,777 --> 01:18:22,156
I order you to get that
out of my sight now! Get them!

1028
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:23,699
-Get them both!
-No, no!

1029
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:25,618
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.

1030
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,746
This marriage is binding,
and that makes me king!

1031
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,123
-See? See?
-No, let go of me! Shrek!

1032
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,917
-No!
-Don't just stand there, you morons.

1033
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,085
Get out of my way! Fiona!

1034
01:18:41,050 --> 01:18:43,969
I'll make you regret the day we met.
I'll see you drawn and quartered!

1035
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,805
-You'll beg for death to save you!
-No! Shrek!

1036
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,183
And as for you, my wife...

1037
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,267
Fiona!

1038
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:53,270
...I'll have you locked back in that tower
for the rest of your days!

1039
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:59,068
I am king! I will have order!
I will have perfection! I will have...

1040
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:08,202
All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon
here, and I'm not afraid to use it.

1041
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:11,413
I'm a donkey on the edge!

1042
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:17,836
Celebrity marriages.
They never last, do they?

1043
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,508
Go ahead, Shrek.

1044
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,804
Fiona?

1045
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,681
Yes, Shrek?

1046
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:32,768
I love you.

1047
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,562
Really?

1048
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:38,148
Really, really.

1049
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:41,694
I love you, too.

1050
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:53,706
"Until you find true love's first kiss

1051
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,042
"and then take love's true form."

1052
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:23,819
"Take love's true form.
Take love's true form."

1053
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,952
Fiona?

1054
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:38,834
Fiona. Are you all right?

1055
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:43,005
Well, yes.

1056
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:47,426
But I don't understand.
I'm supposed to be beautiful.

1057
01:20:50,637 --> 01:20:52,097
But you are beautiful.

1058
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:57,061
I was hoping this would be
a happy ending.

1059
01:21:45,150 --> 01:21:48,946
God bless us, every one.

1060
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,476
That's funny.

1061
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,104
can't breathe. I can't breathe.
