Review,Star Rating
"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10.",10
"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.",10
"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.""",10
The best movie in history and the best ending in any entertainment business,10
"Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course. Bethany Cox.",10
"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",10
"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!",10
"Based on a novella by Stephen King, this is better than even THE GREEN MILE and goes to show that you don't need supernatural elements in a prison story – the setting is enough to carry a film as it is. SHAWSHANK often shows up as the ""best film of all time"" on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact.Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever.",10
"Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, ""The Godfather"" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like ""On The Waterfront"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's ""Cool Hand Luke"", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10",10
"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",10
"There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you simply watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart.",10
"None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film.",10
"Shawshank Redemption, The (1994)**** (out of 4)An innocent man (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison on murder charges and once there he bonds with another man (Morgan Freeman) serving a life sentence. I remember seeing this when it was first released to theaters and walking out thinking it was a masterpiece but apparently others couldn't be bothered to see it since the box office results were very low and it was out of theaters in no time. Over the years the reputation of this film has grown and as I write this it's currently #1 at IMDb. I certainly wouldn't call this the greatest film ever made but it's certainly one of them. I think it's an insult to call this a prison movie because it's so much more than that. This is a film about friendship and hope. Those are two things that have played major parts in many movies but I can't think of too many films where the payoff is as large. What makes the film work so well is that director Durabont takes his time telling a story that takes place over twenty years. Another wonderful thing the director does is that he really makes the twenty years pass on a believable manor. Most films that jump time feel cheap and rushed but that's not the case here because the wonderful screenplay lets us get to know the two main character but also the supporting characters are very well written. What really brings this magic to life are the performances, which are downright brilliant and I'd argue that you can see some of the greatest ensemble acting right in this film. Robbins and Freeman are terrific together and really make for one of the most memorable friendships in movie history. The way Robbins walks and talks is perfectly done and I just love the way, as Freeman says in his narration, he walks around as if he didn't have a care in the world. Freeman gives another wonderful performance but what's really great about him is the narration he adds as he tells us the story. James Whitmore is terrific as the elderly convict and Clancy Brown and Bob Gunton make for excellent villains. I won't spoil the ending for anyone but the final twenty-minutes are at times breathtaking in their beauty and it's message of hope rings louder than most movies.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!",10
"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally  found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There  is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element  comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.   I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that  people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of  Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.   However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find  meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne?",9
"An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences.",10
"This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.",10
"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is to me the most powerful and emotional film ever made, dragging emotions out of you as you deeply connect with each character in different ways. A truly beautiful film, one of the greatest.",10
"not for a reason. but for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. a film who reminds more than presents. values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. short - a film who must see !",10
"**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one.",10
"In 1947 Andy Dufresne is jailed for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison where he tells his fellow inmates he is innocent but as fellow inmate 'Red' says; everybody in Shawshank is innocent. Red has already served ten years and is the guy to see if you want something smuggled into the prison. Andy asks for two things; a small rock hammer and Rita Hayworth! Soon after Red provides him with one rock hammer and a large poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go; he is too useful and he knows too much that won't stop Andy though.This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is rightfully considered a classic. There are no scenes that felt unnecessary from start to finish the story moves at a good pace. We see both the good and the bad inside the prison; there are scenes of brutality but also scenes of joy such as watching the prisoners enjoy the simple pleasure of having a cold beer of a scorching day it is details like this that make the film special. There is also the joy of seeing that Andy will not break and his greatest triumph coming just as it looks as if he has finally reached breaking point. The cast does a great job; Tim Robbins is great as Andy and the always reliable Morgan Freeman is on top form as Red; theirs is one of the great portrayals of a screen friendship. It isn't just the likable characters who are well acted though; Bob Gunton is subtly unpleasant as the hypocritical Warden; quoting scripture one minute profiteering, and much worse, the next; Clancy Brown is also great as the truly unpleasant Captain Hadley; the senior guard who brutalises the inmates. After the suffering inside the finale chapter where we see Andy's escape and revenge makes this a feel-good movie despite what we've seen before. This is definitely a must see film.",10
"Stephen King's novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen.",10
"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended.",10
"My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life.",10
"This is the sole film in the world that is over 2 hours and yet I wanted another 2. The story, the acting, the sense of justice, the acting, the triumph of good but not in a linear manner, the acting and certainly the authentic feel of the era make this a justified masterpiece.Hollywood has lost the ability to make good films nowadays.Keep churning out the stand up comic Thor, Hollywood.",10
"It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's ""a man who knows how to get things."" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format.",10
"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",8
"The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was. What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a ""prison movie"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat! All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast! I promise you that you won't be sorry!!!",10
"What would you do, if the world came down on you, wrongly sentenced for a crime, that will take all your life's time; you're quite gentle and quite shy, don't feel the need to shout or cry, so you take it on the chin, accept the view, and settle in.Then distractions take their toll, incarceration's in control, prison guards dealing in pain, fellow cons who can't refrain; new friends help, you're not alone, surrounded by these walls of stone, movie pinups play their part, to lift spirits and keep good heart.Soon the governor fills his tills, make's the most of all your skills, he's an unforgiving kind, but there's money to be mined; you disperse what you collect, keeping covered all aspects, knowing channels have been primed, and overwhelmingly begrimed.Perpetually entertaining stuff.",9
This for me and many other people is the greatest movie of all time it has amazing directing it has amazing acting by Tim Robinson and Morgan freeman whoever says that they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again overall the greatest movie of all time.,9
The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling. The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it. Breathtaking!,8
I like the bit when the warden threw the rock through the poster.,10
"I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life",10
"At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.",10
I have never watched a better movie than this before,8
"It's not a complex tale, but it is a tale done well that is inspirational in spite of the bleak environment.I am continually fascinated by the complexity of Andy Dufresne. (Presumably) the only innocent man in Shawshank, it is nevertheless Andy who seems to best incapsulate the guilt of his actions. Did he kill his wife? No. But I always feel as though he blames himself for her cheating, blames himself for wanting to kill her, and seems to accept his fate more than most men might.The friendship of Red and Andy is regularly regarded as one of the high points of this film, and it has always resonated with me. The innocent man (Andy) breaks all sorts of laws and plans an elaborate prison break. The guilty man (Red) pays for his crimes and is eventually released on good behavior. Both end up together on a beach in Mexico, to live out the rest of their lives in solitude, apart from society. That's always felt like the tragedy of Shawshank; criminal or not, everyone ends up the same broken man by the end.The brief moments of freedom in this film shine like nothing else, for me. The beer break on the roof, the opera played over the PA, and finally the broken boat on the shores of the Pacific: each of these moments is engineered by Andy to get a taste, a glimpse of freedom. Things that he had taken for granted before Shawshank. That scene where the men drink the beer on the roof looks like the tastiest beer I could ever imagine, almost completely because of the dark tone of the film up until that point.",10
"This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. ""One of the best movies ever"", my best friend said, ""My favorite movie in the whole wide world"", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.",10
"i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.",10
"One of the best movies ever made. Simple as that. Top 20 ever, and top 3 of the 90s. The ending is just so powerful.",10
"WHAT. A. MOVIEIt is just so well acted. You believe it all and want more of every single character!Clever, moralistic and entertaining.Hollywood has done very few consequential movies since (V For Vendetta, Captain Fantastic and perhaps Watchmen..) so grab this one if you have not watched it.",10
"I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time.  That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.",10
"Andy Defresne is a young banker who goes to pieces when he learns his wife is being unfaithful.  He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is picked up for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of innocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately introduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's story of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve the conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is surprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15 or 20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However time has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is mainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that engages and eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film and others appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well with all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the key difference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy and Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very easily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at the same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this simple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by so many viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a little too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any Hollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so far to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship that aren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no tension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the ending was too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been more in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to this.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins is great as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable in his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I was caught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the Irish guy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father figure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The chemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine support actors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others may not always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to be very clichéd (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with the genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main relationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not the most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is very good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As director Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane shot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has become almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping sense of hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high appearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great little story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clichés of the genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope that it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a popular and moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that see it.",9
"After just seeing this,i have to say i think its one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story.And one of the few films that can be called a ""moden classic"". The Plot:After the police in Maine find the bodies of a married woman and her lover,who were shot eight times.They bring in the married woman's husband.A hot-shot banker Andy Dufren(Tim""The Mystic River"" Robbins) .Who clams that he is not guilty.At the end of the case,Andy is found guilty and given two life sentences at Shawshank prison Maine.When he is first there he is very closed off from everyone.And has fights with a prison group called ""The Sisters"".Until he tells a guard how to keep money from a will.While in there,he gets the trust of the guards and the warden and builds a strong friendship with a black marketeer named Red(played fantastically by Morgan""The Dreamcatcher,The Se7ven""Freeman).Things are going well,till an inmate Tommy,tells Andy,that in a prison he was in,he met the man who did the murder Andys in Shawshank for.The warden,who thinks Tommy is to much of a risk for his money business due to Andy doing all work for him),so he kills Tommy.After this,Andy decides its time he gets out of Shawshank.View on the film:The cast. This is one of the rare films,where all the cast just click into there roles.The two leads Robbins and Freeman,who give some of there best work in this film.The way they work and build there friendship in the film,that is sadly rarely seen in any movies.The supporting characters in the film do a really good job at standing out and not feeling like they are just card-board cut outs.The main one in the supporting cast that stand out is James Whitmore as Brooks.who makes a very enjoyable characters,who you feel very sad,to see go out in a very sad way.The Screenply/Direction.Wirter/director Frank""The Green Mile"" Darabont (who made a student-film based on a King short story:The Woman in the Red Room),does a screenplay that easily improves on the short story.While Kings short story spent (i feel) a bit to much time on the exposition in his story,while Darabont makes sure to keep the set-up going at a good pace,and to tighten some of the story lines(Brooks was hardly in the short story,Tommy was not killed).But he makes sure to keep the feel of the story so they do not feel as strange add-ons to the story.The direction the Darabont does is to make sure to see the actors work build in the scenes,while doing a good job at keeping the film going at a pace that does not feel over-long (something that is rare with movies now). Final view on the film:A movie anyone can enjoy,from age 18-80!",10
".....and Ironically, it most certainly does.Bank Merchant Andy Defrene is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment at the titular prison. Life seems to begin to fade, but fortunately Andy befriends some of the other inmates, in particular a character known only as Red. Over time Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can expect in a prison, his body may be locked away in a cell, but his spirit can never be truly imprisoned.....There is nothing to say about this film that hasn't been said before. Its awe-inspiring, its warm, and most of all, it gives you an enormous sense of well being once the credits roll.From the opening shot of the prison, to the iconic Christ like pose in the rain, the film is chock full of religious allegory, and references the bible in several key scenes. But the film demands repeat viewings, because there is so much subliminal imagery and messages in the film.The acting is brilliant, and the warmth between Andy and Red is the heart of the film, and the chemistry between Freeman and Robbins is second to none.Its a perfectly crafted film, with effortless narrative, and it will make you smile and cry in equal measures.Yes, it should have ended when Freeman got on the bus, but nothing is too perfect is it?",10
"This movie is poetry. For those of you who've ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue, you'll understand what I mean when I say this.The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman's ability to narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. He is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in his eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a poster of Rita Hayworth.To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day, but never truly see.To describe this movie as ""great"" would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it portrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the credits roll, we're left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand words......",10
"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) **** Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton,Clancy Brown, William Sadler, James Whitmore, Gil Bellows. Excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" with falsely accused of murdering his wife Robbins facing hard time in a corrupt prison and a solid friend (Freeman in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance of stoicism). Great acting and above the preconceived ""prison film"" genre that also breaks away from the cliché of the human spirit yet enables its elements. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Screenplay Adaptation and Director.",10
"This film is easily in my top three favorite films. I return to it time and time again, still captivated! Bravo to everyone involved in this timeless production.",10
"The classic can be recalled repeatedly. Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom. To get out of prison is a new life for him; and red, who has been used to prison life, has become numb. To get out of prison is death for him.",9
"So worth seeing in the theater thanks to fathom events and 25th anniversary plus Stephen King turned 72 recently! I admit I've been on the fence about enjoying Shawshank Redemption for a while but seeing it in the theater and re watching after not seeing it for a long time, I cried, I laughed, felt sympathy, and was very immersed.Truly remarkable and well deserving of every good opinion even after I was on the fence about it, I love the movie a lot now; Tim Robbins embodied such a glorious character! Frank Darabont made such a crafty, dark and heart wrenching experience! Fathom events is excellent, I am glad I paid over $13 dollars to see such drama perfected film.",9
"A sweet and sad story of hope. I really enjoyed this movie, it wast a fun movie but it didn't have to be. It was so excellently written and acted, I really cared for all the characters and was truly heartbroken when Brooks died. So much time was given for the characters to develop and build friendship. The ending had such a long build up and was so extremely satisfying. I love how life in prison was portrayed, it was very interesting and got me invested into the story straight away. I thought after Andy was wrongly accused that the movie would focus more on him not being guilty, but it turned away from that and being more unique. The warden was an excellent character as well, he seemed nice at the beginning but slowly became more and more villainous and it really shows when watching. The way everything links together throughout the story is amazing, I love all the connections between characters and plot. This movie is an absolute joy to watch 9/10",10
"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? The storytelling, music, visuals, characters, emotions, themes, literally everything has been carefully thought out and done exceptionally well.My only problems with it -
Tommy just happens to know the guy who killed Andy's wife and that guy just happens confess everything to Tommy.The fact that literally know one, not even the guards during Inspection bothered to flip a poster even once for 17 whole years.",10
"In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters",10
"If you like hopeful, surprising, never-seen-before characters, you will enjoy this amusing story of a family of prisoners victimized by the system and a Bible thumping pig.Robbins and Freeman, and everybody else, gives perfect performances for their characters. Their actions and body languages are perfect for this story and movie.",10
This Is Such A Classic And One Of My Favorite Movies Always Loved Watching This Movie,10
"The emotions, the plot, originality, everything tied together so well at the end - normally I criticise the way movies end, but this ending was phenomenal, not cliche at all. The brutality of the prison was well portrayed, and made me feel sorry for the characters.All the characters were believable and had depth, and none of the scenes were dramatic, but there was tension throughout the film. I'm going to stop fangirling now, but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather!!",10
"I was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying ""Wow"". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside, sit down, and enjoy the journey!",10
"Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a well educated banker, is wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison at Shawshank Penitentiary. This movie follows his life as it falls apart and he succumbs to living as an inmate surrounded by hardened criminals and a strict bible thumping warden with his henchmen prison guards.Saw this movie years ago and was absolutely stunned. This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends. The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating. The prison itself is very authentic and the set pieces are very realistic which captured the prison environment better than any other prison set film except for maybe Escape From Alcatraz. Even as a hard drama this movie is never slow or boring or dry it is simply just that good.",9
"This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likeable or in the case of the pigs so detestable.",10
"It's difficult to review a movie made 25 years ago and say there has been nothing better since, but it is true. The storytelling and the production and the acting and the morality and the good guys and the bad guys and the hope it conveys..., But seeing this in 2021 (again) I have to say the praise is justified.There is just something about Shawshank Redemption.Want to know something amazing? Look at the director's credits. Not into cashing in, is he?",9
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema! The Best Hollywood Film Of All-Time! A Masterpiece! A cult classic! A legendary Epic! A Film that you moves you, leaves you stunned!Performances: Tim Robbins is astounding, his careers finest after Mystic River. Morgan Freeman is masterful, his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby. Others are excellent.'The Shawshank Redemption' is cinema at its very best. My salute to this flick! A true Masterpiece! I just love this film! The most powerful film of all-time.",9
"This film will stand the test of time 
And it will remain one of the best films ever madePlease do not remake this gem 
It must be left alone..Superb",8
"Quite deserving of such acclaim, the acting is superb, the storyline captivating, and the cinematography quite beautiful. The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold. Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly. And let's be honest, how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad?",9
"I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption"" from the book ""Different Seasons"" more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome.",10
"You have already watched this, right?
It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I'm seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don't as a rule.
Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.",9
Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10.,10
"'The Shawshank Redemption'... hmm where do I start. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it really can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison, eventually you would only think of what's outside the prison instead of inside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say home.What the audience really enjoy's about this movie is that you have been deceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is noway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to the guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the whole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the escape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The audience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used to the prison. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly not just a movie, it is also beautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put together to create pure yet daunting art.The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who's wife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and the other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing to Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy does a lot of the workers at the prison's (and that include's the warden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison and he idea's of hope and love of music.One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when Andy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays opera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen Freeman then say's that he had no idea what the two Italian women were singing but doesn't want to know, he just like to imagine that the words were too beautiful to be sung in English.The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely unbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins for a very touching movie that I will always remember.In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also understand that you didn't listen closer to the brilliant word that were able to come out of the actors mouth.Hope is a dangerous thing.",10
Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone.,10
"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.
This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.",10
"I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest throughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving ending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it doesn't matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the intellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay alive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends ""Red,"" a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank's hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a ""basic skills"" learning facility within the prison's library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the head librarian, known as ""Brooks,"" who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters, especially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. ""you can get busy living, or you can get busy dying."" Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An underlining message is that whether you ""get busy living or dying"" you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and mentally ""free"" are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn Movie, ""Bad Boys"" for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad officer in ""Shawshank,"" is just as good as a prison bully in ""Bad Boys."") Another great movie is ""Midnight Express"" which is (although loosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that don't get the same credit that this movie does. Call this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" All three films have the same emotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is ""An Innocent Man,"" which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of similarities to other similar prison pictures, I can't classify it as great for all time",9
"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.",9
"From the director of 1990's ""Buried Alive"" comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary ""Red"", the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (""whatever you want"") to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that's what makes this story so great. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema""The Shawshank Redemption"" was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can't go past ""The Shawshank Redemption.""Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre",10
"A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who?  Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan.  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect.",10
"Shawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was, and some of them (many of them) said, ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and I said, ""I haven't even seen it."" And they assigned it to me as homework. I started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in fact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on IMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I don't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their comments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the picking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect and think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I like, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to know. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why this is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes, invents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the least, and a really good ""wordsmith."" His stories work with simple conflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a turn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty much the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the characters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but flimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful black man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates), and the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played by Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the ""twists"" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and that was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really ""realistic"" in any sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there, from rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as a ""fable"" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final happy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it would naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently interesting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar clichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on purpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and enjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and warm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to fastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second time seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't seen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual (those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because it's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was leisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's drawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, ""movie music"" pure and simple, in its lush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it directly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or ""bad"" especially, but that's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But really, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those now famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of the movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die Hard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark sentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No faulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some great filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some good night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few moments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the escape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed ""nicely"" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be caressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I don't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable. Oh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie, but he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of a lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all had to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more originality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the Shawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we have, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't care for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so again, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that there are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go the places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at all. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much more than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me as flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be superficial, and I, personally, am not.",10
"My top film. Hope is good, and it never dies.

"I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far I'm concerned it's mine to give, if I want to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I don't). I am just sick of people telling me that a movie can't be great because it was story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven movies, I certainly liked this one. So here's another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.",9
"After ten years, I watched this movie again. I wanted to see whether my thoughts will change or not, because ten years ago I did not understand why this movie is at the top. Still, I think it should not be even in top 50 movies, because nothing is special. Years are passing just like a moment, I could not feel his pain or hope. In one scene, he wants something than bum it is happening. Again, for one scene his situation is so bad, than guess what happens? After just 30 seconds, he is good. So you never go top or down during this movie. My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number 1 expectations.

"Truly a masterpiece of cinema.  I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by.  Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film.  How did it not win oscars galore.  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story.  A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints.  I LOVE THIS FILM!",9
"A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly ""stares-off-into-the-distance"" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.",9
"When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a well made, engaging and comprehensive film.It's an escape film without action, thrills or suspense, even though we're aware that he's digging off screen. It's more of a collective story than memorable moments. The characters are good and the performances solid, though not demanding as a lot of it's in the narration. Only the Brooks part's really evoking and perhaps the bit playing the record, as the tone's that of a harsh setting. The inner worry and satisfaction Andy must feel as the warden and guard are in his cell next to the poster, gives more weight to the record scene as all that work could've been for nothing if they took away everything. Though knowing they didn't find out perhaps kept his sanity while in isolation.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994): Dir: Frank Darbont / Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, William Sadler: Gripping film about finding refuge in a place of despair. Tim Robbins plays banker Andy Dufresne in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. The verdict is not the issue, but rather his familiarizing himself into routine life within prison walls. He faces the trials of violent leering inmates but forms a bond with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. Redding can get things for a price and soon Andy has items smuggled into his cell. Andy finds favor when his banking comes into play and doing taxes for the corrupt Christian warden and the guards. Andy is able to improve the library but discovers a scheme by the warden that leaves him to his own devices when proof of his innocence is sabotaged. Director Frank Darabont paints the grim and depressing portrait of prison and populates it with personalities struggling to exist within. Robbins is at his best as a victim adapting and improving his circumstance before intelligence wins out. Freeman is great as the humble and resourceful Redding. James Whitmore plays aged librarian Brooks whose release leads to questions regarding freedom verses existence. Bob Gunton is effective as the ruthless warden. Redemption is freedom of mind and soul whether in prison or in opportunity. Score: 10 / 10",10
"You could describe ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in a number of ways; engrossing drama, riveting character study, top-shelf prison movie. But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.And that cast is impeccable.9/10",9
"a film about freedom. not only because the story has as scene a prison. but for the force and grace and precise of creation freedom of actors and director, ideas and dialogs, whole script and special emotions of viewer. it is a rare film because it represents more than brilliant acting or smart script. it is a homage for basic values and eulogy to friendship. it is representation of a form of revolution who can be considered fruit of a different religious perception. it seems be perfect. and this is key to be more than a good/interesting film but an extraordinary cinema lesson. Red, Rita Hayworth poster and Andy Dufresne. that is all. at first sigh.",10
"Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as ""Red"" - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too ""easy"" - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10.",8
"Decent entertainment, somewhat memorable. Why this is seen as such an incredible, sensational work of art is beyond me... I feel like this is one of the few crime-thriller-prison-action related films that met my expectations, as in, was A Good Film, but that alone doesn't make it a classic.",7
"I am not black, not a crook, not a prisoner, not a Christian retarded warden and not from that period and yet i identify with these guys, their plight and their times.The story is entertaining, the characters interesting and the plot development anticipatory and fascinating.Makes me forget for 2 hours that I live in a period of remakes, sequels, gender switches, DCU, MCU and... GAG.",9
"When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie",10
Well what can you say that hasn't already been said. This is just an excellent film. Morgan Freeman narrating is exceptional. Tim Robbins in his career defining role. Probably the best prison film ever made.,8
"There have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do to the actors. Then there are some films are great because of what was written. With The Shawshank redemption, IMDb's favorite film, in works in both cases. The acting is superb, and the film is incredibly well written and very justified.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. So he is sent to Shawshank prison, where he experience's lots of things. He forms a bond with Red(played terrificly by Morgan Freeman). The warden(played by Bob Gunton) hates him. He is raped. And all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years.The Shawshank redemption, which is based on a shot story by Stephen King, is one of the most interesting films ever made. It'a also one of the best films ever made too. What is one way to tell: When you hear Morgan Freeman's narration, you know you're in good hands.The acting is explosive. Everyone does such a good job. The Shawshank redemption is a little long, but the length is tolerable. Mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. Morgan Freeman gives the better performance of the two, but the duo of Robbins and Freeman is once in a lifetime.The Shawshank redemption was an Oscar upset. It was nominated for seven, including Best picture, Best actor(Morgan Freeman) and best writing. And it lost best picture to Forrest Gump, which is also a great movie. 94 was the year of Pulp fiction also. Another Oscar upset. I prefer Pulp fiction, but The Shawshank redemption is still one of the best films ever made.The Shawshank redemption:A+",7
"However delightful as it is The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance.It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches it's only a very safe buddy story A damn good one but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for Friendship Huh neat At the end of the day Shawshank is a good film but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review as countless others have done but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is it's about as likable and massmarketed as possible There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences it plays it safe and in my opinion a bit too safe. I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film .Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry but I found it utterly average I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker.But what about the great twist ok the twist was good but come on like i said before was it THAT great Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects Also how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit Watch Le Samurai or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior
.Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was SorryThe film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest but not really very interesting beyond its surface.On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration But moving on and looking past that it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves Sure it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story On top of that it never falls prey to predictable sappiness probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well sewn together by a feel good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film That common misunderstanding behind, a well made film Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies I'm sure the same can be said for himThough I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made it was still a very good very well made very entertaining and almost heartbreakingThis is a film that should be seen because its a good movie not because its a great one.",10
"Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them ""The Woman In The Room"", directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?",8
"i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time..",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination. Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling, and satisfying story it entails.",10
"I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.",10
Tye movie is just perfect. The acting the story the characters are just so good that they will even make you cry,10
"Great music, superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars. It was not fair.The only reason for which I rented this movie, two years ago, was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then )It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND REDEMPTION.IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YOÚ WON'T REGRET.",10
"To tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in fact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat action, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so closely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the harmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the end). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is a beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect, Morgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be. Highly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age- !judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it deserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any movie should, this one might as well be it. *********",10
"A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.",7
"Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the history of hollywood.",7
this film is an award winning achievement i loved it what a fantastic and brilliant together drama and crime movie really really amazing a must see to everyone.the story is about a guy called Andy Dufresne who was sent to prison for a murder that was committed to his wife and Andy goes through prison with hard times and a friend for his time in the shaw shank prison with brilliant ac tining from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and Clancy brown throughout the film Tim Robbins was Andy Morgan freeman red and Clancy brown as the guard.overall the whole truth can not be told u will love this film don't spoil this for your self its a brilliant story with friendship and survival 10/10 you must get this on DVD trust me its brilliant,10
"This is it.The film has it all. Superb actors, even better screenplay, fabulous redemptive conclusion and believe me when I insist with all of that said they did not forget the entertainment.Are there/will there ever be any other films like this?",10
"I cannot think of one reason I would not give this 10/10 just out of principle. Otherwise, it is the perfect movie with an incredible story, acting and euphoric finale that nonetheless is not without tragedy in the meantime.I need to find the original story.",8
"!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just for spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with ""give me an Oscar pleeeeeease"" all over it. You know the type  - like ""Dances with Wolves."" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, ""Nothing to Lose"" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause ""that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank."" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying ""you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all."" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called ""The Dead Psychologist"" or Citizen Kane was called ""The Sled"" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is ""slow"" or ""moves at its own pace"" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality!",10
"The question you have to ask is, wasn't this the most well made movie to date? I think so, but what makes this movie so special?To make a movie special you really need to look at it in a different way. Where other phenomenal movies have many of the same characteristics as this one, The Shawshank Redemption has that little bit extra. Yes the performances are brilliant and yes the pace of the movie is well thought out but there are many other movies that are great for the same reasons as that.What is different about this movie is that the creators were not afraid to go outside the lines. I mean look at most movies, they usually go from OK to good, to bad and then back to good again. On top of that nothing really deviates from the main story line nowhere-days as to keep the run time as low as possible. If The Shawshank Redemption was made in 2019 it would be significantly shorter and this is all down to production company want to keep the run time as low as possible. Now I am not say this masterpiece is long because it isn't. It only sits at 142 minutes but there are scenes that might be see as unnecessary by the untrained eye. Let's look at the massive deviation of the movie, the release of Brooks Hatlen. Now this scene is extremely important for the entire movie. It truly shows how a person can fall into that routine and become institutionalized. It gives us an idea on real life and opens our eyes to something as sad as this.The Shawshank Redemption is up and down throughout with just fantastic character development. It puts you in the movie and you can really feel how the characters are feeling and how awful the prison environment is or was in real life. It didn't follow any stereotypes it just educated us on what is really going on in the world. It sticks to the theme of real life by having two of the non-criminals being the antagonists throughout. It shows us how people in the real world abuse the power they have over one an other. We live in a cruel world and Frank Darabont hit the nail on the head with this timeless movie classic.",7
"The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.",10
"This is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest prison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to ""submarine""-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat, therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha). But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama ""The Green Mile"", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they're watching at face value and never mind that ""I've seen this all before""-feel. Or maybe they haven't or just have a lousy memory? Yes I admit, I'm something of a cynic. But I also believe I'm able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one. Probably that's the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy's 1932 ""I'm A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery here, as I hope you'll agree when you see this true classic.",10
"For it's subtlety, it's intelligence, and it's gorgeous cinematography (often overlooked in this film), this is one of the finest films ever made. Robbins and Freeman are brilliant. The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless. The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by Frank Darabont. A powerful story of one man's journey through a punishment he did not deserve, and ""redemption"" of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers. It reminds us that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things"". Gentle and supremely smart.",10
"A friend of mine listed ""The Shawshank Redemption"" as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in front of the TV (a melodrama doesn't kill, right?)I don't know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times, being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before.Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it's about life-changing experiences, about the endless struggle against life's harshness and unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was nominated, but it's all about struggling against unfairness, time's proved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150 minutes.",8
"I rewatched the movie recently with my son. I found the movie quite unremarkable. Mostly because it is rather primitive and schematic. There are sadistic guards, crooked boss, camaraderie of fellow prisoners, a almost messianic story of Andy, a wrongly imprisoned former banker who overcomes the adversity and ends up winning the lottery so to say.And movie slowly goes through the motions of torment, dispair, opportunities, hope and revenge.And it has that kind of theatrical feel to it and quite slow pacing. Like you already know what Brooks is up to, yet takes forever for him to hang himself. Or it felt that way.Another cringe worthy scene was when Andy escapes. When he sheds prison attire and spreads his arms lifts his face to the rain. It was almost funny.Another thing, the life in prison, despite sadistic guard and corrupt boss, looks like some kind of summer camp. Like life there is almost great, just a bit monotonous. No grit. Everyone clean shaven, washed and neatly dressed. You know, like it is a drama play by rich students in college drama club.I think the movie is popular because viewers get trapped in their indignation at the injustice leveled at Andy, they root for him and get rewarded by the happy ending. So it feels good, satisfying. But to me it was boring and predictable at the same time.",10
"It is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the profound human experiences hidden within the darkness of a prison. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman's captivating performance as Red create an indelible bond that transcends the boundaries of their confined world. Director Frank Darabont weaves a poignant tale of hope, friendship, and the pursuit of redemption against the backdrop of injustice and despair. The film's visual splendor and evocative soundtrack enhance the emotional depth of the story, leaving audiences inspired and deeply moved. ""Finding Beauty in the Shadows: The Shawshank Redemption"" reminds us that even in the bleakest of circumstances, the human spirit can find solace and beauty, making it an enduring and cherished classic.",9
"It takes audiences on an unforgettable cinematic journey, exploring the indomitable human spirit and the pursuit of redemption. Tim Robbins delivers a compelling performance as Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. Through his unlikely friendship with Red, portrayed brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, the film delves deep into the complexities of human connection and the transformative power of hope. Frank Darabont's directorial finesse brings Stephen King's novella to life, painting a poignant portrait of resilience amidst a harsh and unforgiving prison environment. With its thought-provoking themes, stellar performances, and emotionally resonant storytelling, ""Finding Redemption: The Shawshank Journey"" continues to captivate audiences, earning its place as one of cinema's most beloved and timeless classics.",9
"It is a timeless tale of hope and resilience that remains deeply impactful to this day. Set within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film intricately weaves a narrative of human spirit's triumph over adversity and the enduring power of hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver captivating performances, infusing life into their characters and making their journey truly unforgettable. Under the skilled direction of Frank Darabont, the film's storytelling unfolds seamlessly, drawing the audience into a world of despair and redemption. Through its exploration of friendship, injustice, and the pursuit of freedom, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" resonates with audiences worldwide, leaving a profound and emotional impression that lingers long after the credits roll.",10
This is the best movie I ever watched in my entire life.whenerver I feel sad or depressed I always watch this movie.it always gives me hope.Hope is a good thing.,7
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.",10
"Stephen King is of course, a gifted storyteller. Maybe this might not be his most personal writing, if you want to read a very insightful book on prison detention and the atrocities and misconducts that exist, read the Star Rover, it is fantastic.To me, this is filled with far too many shortcuts, basically everything is in hand for Dusfrene to escape. The perfect location, the cell on the extremity of the facility floor, yet we can't really see where the foundation leads to, apparently it leads into the pipelines. Also the great timing, the fact that he manages to work out taxes, bills, finances for a 100 person, and in charge of the library, and with a rock hammer that he trades from Red, he breaches a cement wall. I don't get how any of this is realistic - since it's a King's series, might as well turn into a fantasy. But it's incoherent, lacks coherent flow, it intends to empathy with cons who really seem to be very friendly people (sort of), and might be innocent. I'm not sure these people are all quite recommendable and the camaraderie between detainees necessary - it is certainly not the same nature between workers that are part of a union. I fail to understand how a movie can go two hours and then in a span of ten minutes, retrace ten years of escape planning without giving us any hints on where Dusfrene will strike. The scenes where he is revealed that a mobster murdered his wife and her lover makes no sense, it doesn't work, I don't understand it - the scene when he plays opera is tacky - again, this movie reaches. And then of course, a post-modern ending to a movie that is set in the 60s, where two guys meet on the beach, Dusfrene treating a beat up boat. Again, the development reaches, it is just a series of shortcuts that arrange the directors in order to get through it by just being lazy. The performances are dull, there is hardly any real focus, any real acting, it doesn't focus enough on the characters, it moves too fast.This movie just doesn't work.",7
"This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!",10
And i think it might be the best movie of all time.,10
"I've seen this movie twice. Once in a Tyneside cinema in 1994, and just now on BBC iPlayer in early 2023. The most loved film in history, top of all the charts, Stephen King fiction married to Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their dramatic peak. During my first viewing I was a depressed alcoholic undergraduate student. Today I am a grizzled veteran of the mental health system with an honours degree and a master's in philosophy. No longer depressed, I am still a heavy drinker. Since its release in 1994, I have changed (admittedly only a little) more than The Shawshank Redemption.I remembered some of the violent bits but had totally forgotten details of the plot, except for memory snippets of an oak tree and a man-hug on a Mexican beach. The work makes words like dignity and hope and justice ping through viewers minds. Notions of mens noble characters being revealed through the prism of suffering flit around the collective grey cells of the hypnotized liberal masses.In the cold light of a January day nearly thirty years since that foray into the Geordie multiplex, I was drawn to a few blemishes. Nods (like head-butts) to The Great Escape and Escape From Alcatraz. The lack of believability in the warden's competence at diddling the books and getting away with it for so long. The juxtaposition of one old inmate being allowed to nurture and care for a massive raven whilst a new boy is murdered on his first night for being scared and homesick, by the brutal yet controlled psychopathy of the said warden's Head Boy. The lack of exaggerated universal harshness of conditions for inmates, shot in beautiful soft light as they go about their chores and converse freely at table. As if the producers and director were playing a game of prison movie top trumps but without their hearts set on victory.More recent artistic examinations of incarceration in the USA, set against the backdrop, basically, of the ridiculous 'war on drugs', assert that prison is incessantly about racial tensions, inked flesh, massive upper body muscles, and much much more generally vicious behaviour between inmates and staff and inmates. The game of top trumps continues, cartels adding to the scores of our new trophy-hungry realists.Modern films create special effects that appear as literal. The graphics have improved. Shawshank was one of those movies shot just enough in the past to have maintained a more traditional approach to portraying violence and the physical consequences of it.Depicting the three decades immediately following WW2, there was a sense that the director stayed true to the socio-cultural norms of the decades passing, but shifts of time in a timeless institution could only be communicated by changing movie star posters in Andy's cell. The only societal progress evident in prison is Rita Hayworth being replaced by Marilyn and her being superceded by Raquel Welsh.I'm just wittering now. I've been writing futile, unread user reviews for IMDB for over a year and not really knowing why. I thought I'd take a stab at Shawshank for some reason and maybe find a new angle but it's all been said. It's a good movie but having just finished my second viewing, I'm not sure it is the greatest ever made. I watched a movie last year called 'Alpha', about the inadvertent domestication of dogs by an ancient tribe of hunter-gatherers. Big weepy.Above all, and as a final comment, I would like to reflect on what I think 'Shank is truly about. It's not about hope, dignity, depravity, humanity, fear, corruption, prison conditions or even redemption. It's very simple. It's about innocence. In this regard, it remains a towering rendition. And maybe that's why it does so well.Andy was innocent all along, in every conceivable way, and yet he was punished more than anyone else, in every dark way imaginable. He could have caved, he could have cracked. He didn't bother banging on about being innocent, forever maintaining or protesting his whinging innocence. Throughout his Odyssean tour of physical, emotional, sexual and spiritual agony he achieved something far more beautiful with his innocence. He retained it. And proved it for the world to see, in a triumph of wit, planning, and school-boy belligerence.",10
"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (""Red"") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and ""Red"" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in ""The Shawshank Redemption.""",10
"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to re-watch. I must say right away that I like this film, but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line - this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors.
I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in ""A Space Odyssey"". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not ""Shawshank Redemption"". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?",10
"I had been meaning to see this film since it is rated #1 on IMDb. It is a very good film and very well acted; however, no wayyyyyy is it the best film of all time. Morgan Freeman is particularly good as Red and the other actors perform very admirably, but I don't find the film overwhelmingly powerful. I've seen many many films that do more. I rate it a 7 out of 10.",10
"I liked this film. That sums it up pretty well. This film is good, in some aspects very good, but the best film of all time? I usually don't say this, but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated. I don't want to take away from the performances, the story or the score, those were really good. I guess Opinions differ and that's fine. For me personally the fact that I knew that this film was ""the highest rated film of all time"" unfortunately hurt my experience. I was expecting a lot more, which in the end I didn't get.
But still a good watch nonetheless.",8
Just watched it today....better late than sorry...amazing movie.,8
"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.",10
Nice title :) 10/10 best one i have seen my dude couldn't get any better,10
"This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made.  It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins.  But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes).  Very memorable, showing what movies are made of.  Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie.  A++",10
"What to say about the ""Shawshank Redemption""? I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin' immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect.",10
"It has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But I need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the ""smart"" people declare it like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn good...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. And I do, yes I do!",10
"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book, and I didn't liked it that much, but then I saw the movie. And that's a things that's never happened to me before, the movie was better than the book. It's the other way normally. But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie, it is great.",3
"We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!",10
"Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.",9
"It's amazing how long I could not watch this movie. However, I became interested in them only after reading the book. And the book is very good. However, the same can be said about the film. Yes, there are some nuances ...",10
"When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking.",10
"This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.    The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience ""It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..."" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.  While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art.",10
"This movie is a fine way to spend 140 minutes, but is by no means a movie of the first rank. The script is far too simplistic, cliché-ridden and predictable. The characters are far too good guy/bad guy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course of 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And, just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas the people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among inspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing.",9
"I remember when i first saw this film. my friend kept telling me to watch it as he thought it was brilliant. well, all good things come to those who wait yes? i did something I had never done before or since: when i finished watching it i rewound it and watched it again straight after.It has a perfect cast, story and the best ending of any film i have ever seen.To sum up in one word: magical!",3
"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, ""Shawshank"" was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****",3
"It is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that unfurls a profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship, and the unyielding human spirit. Tim Robbins portrays Andy Dufresne, a man unjustly imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, while Morgan Freeman delivers a captivating performance as Red, his fellow inmate and confidant. As the story unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film explores the resilience of the human soul and the transformative power of hope in the darkest of circumstances. Directed with skill and sensitivity by Frank Darabont, this timeless classic weaves a tapestry of emotions, leaving a lasting impression on its audience. ""Hope Unchained: The Shawshank Redemption"" continues to inspire and uplift, reminding us that even in the face of adversity, hope can set us free.",10
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sent to Shawshank prison: For Life. Andy is a very intelligent man, a hot shot banker when he was free, and now he's just a number, at the mercy of Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his head guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown).Andy is a quiet man, but manages to attract the attention of the sisters (Barely Human Homosexual rapists) led by Bogs (Mark Rolston) and he begins his prison life, desperately fighting his admirers, sometimes he'd win, sometimes he'd lose, but he always stayed quiet.Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man who can get things, and he is Andy's first friend on the inside. We witness Andy's relationships with Red, the Guards, the Warden, the sisters and the rest of the inmates, develop through Morgan Freeman's perspective, but always revolving around Andy. In his time there he successfully wins personal battles, gains favour with the guards and inmates alike, and restructures the rehabilitation of so many with his unwavering persistence and drive.All the members of the cast are more than adequate, but i have to single out Freeman and Robbins. Freeman guides the viewing audience in an informative and subtle manner, and Robbins, in his finest performance ever, gives us hope and wisdom, as he manipulates the powers around him so cleverly, to make life as easy as he can for all his fellow inmates.The Movie is very powerful and moving throughout, and it doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of prison life. And at the end when the climax falls into place, you will be left completely satisfied by its unquestionable brilliance.For those who have not seen this movie, all i can say is watch it.10/10",10
"I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well.",9
"Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen.  The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I've heard",3
"The acting is adequate, the story is adequate, but why all the fuss?It sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the mill.This is not that bad a film, just seen it all before.",10
"A powerful and moving story that showcases the human spirit and its resilience in the face of adversity.The Shawshank Redemption is a life lesson. It teaches us that no matter how dark and hopeless our situation may seem, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. It shows us that friendship, courage, and perseverance can overcome any obstacle and injustice. It makes us feel every emotion, from anger and sadness to joy and relief. It has amazing performances, a brilliant script, and a stunning soundtrack. It is a masterpiece that I can watch over and over again, and never get tired of it. It is the best film ever made, in my opinion.It is a film that transcends its genre and becomes a timeless classic. It is one of the best films ever made.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s.  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.",7
"I like to keep things short and sweet.
Incredible, unforgettable, three-demential characters that develop over the course of the filmAmazing story with tons of twists and turns you will never see comingOne of the best endings in filmActing is outstandingGreat foreshadowingPerfect runtimeI would say to stop reading this review and just watch it already but let's face it, you already have.",6
"This movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it. It's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's absolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be fair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The Godfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the times, not even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""American Me"", they are stronger and wiser. But..people has the last word.",10
The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family. Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have seen tons of films. Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyone's heart. From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.,10
"One of the best films of all times. They don't make them like they use to, and we slowly forget what art is.",10
"This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once.  Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!",10
"Andy is an innocent man who gets sent to prison for murdering his wife. He endures many hardships such as listening to opera records, and having to do the taxes of prison guards for free. He falls in love with an old black guy named Red, who likes to narrate things. Red is a very wise man who says things like ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" and ""Show me the money"". 
Andy gets tired of being in prison and steals the warden's shoes and escapes. The warden blows his brains out because Andy stole his shoes. Red misses Andy and leaves prison to go live with him on the beach.
This is definitely the greatest movie ever made. Except for ""Overboard"". The one with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Douglas. Not the new one.",10
"I always really enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption and my appreciation remains consistent with repeated viewings. With a 9.3 IMDB rating decades after it's release shows that this is a movie that speaks to people and I have not met anyone who doesn't like this movie. Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best, I like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just as much for different reasons. But don't tell Steven King that, lol. The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie, it's an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish. Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography, direction and a great attention to detail. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable performances. The Shawshank Redemption is flawless filmmaking and storytelling that has few films that are it's equal. All and all, The Shawshank Redemption is perfect in my book and is recommended to anybody who wants to see a great movie.",10
Best movie ive seen.This movie 20 years on is still first class.,8
"This majestic movie is about Andy (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover after discovering she had been cheating on him. He gets impounded with two life sentences in the Shawshank Prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who befriends him, and as the story moves along slowly, he eventually understands what Andy once told him: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""Andy is persistent in his quest to be free. And he tries to convince Red during the entire course of the movie that hope is indeed a good thing, even in a prison like Shawshank. In his endeavor, Andy will come face to face with the warden, who is truly a manifestation of greed itself. Many challenges will test his mettle.This piece of art is not to be missed; it is one of the greatest works of modern drama. And the slow pace of the movie only helps further to sink you in its mood, and leave you satisfied with a strange bitter sweet feeling in the end.",6
"WEll I had high hopes for this movie.  But it fell way short.  I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen.  Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.Jason",10
"I have been a fan of this movie for a long time.It seems that ever time my life hits a downward spiral, I can always seem to pop this movie in, and come up with a solution to my pending problem. It somehow gives Me sense of peace and inner strength.So, It wasn't all that strange for me to pop it in when I was going through a rough patch in my marriage. I found myself identifying with many of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a mistake that had been made early on in their lives. This film gave me the strength to escape from my world of misery. And now I am able to say I, Like Andy broke out of my own personal Shawshank.My Ex isn't too happy about the divorce. But life is much better now. And I feel saved from a life of unhappiness, Due to a mistake of a marriage to early in life.Thank You Frank Durabont.Your film saved my life.",10
"An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal. Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather, it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities. And finally if it was told in a non-linear tale then it would have been much more interesting",10
"By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history.",9
"Whilst the IMDb users may disagree, the Shawshank Redemption isn't my number 1, maybe not even my top 100. But with that said, I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary. There is no doubt it is good, I may even say it's close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating, but it's forced metaphors get on my nerves now and, in reality, is just another prison movie which is above average. Boring if you have seen it a few times, but for a first impression it is good. Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is. A perfect film it is not, but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate. Not my favorite film, not my favorite prison film, but give it a whirl and see how you decide.",10
"I am bowled over by this movie. This is simply the best movie ever made. The story just leaves you moved and the performances in the movie are clearly the best performances ever on screen. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman enact their roles to perfection, they don't miss out even a dot in fulfilling the roles to excellency.I cant believe i waited so long before i actually watched this movie, i should have watched it before, and then over and over again.Don't be scared to watch this movie, you will be amazed by this masterpiece. I cant stop raving, I say WATCH IT NOW! 10 on 10 isn't enough!",8
"This is not just a movie. I cant explain it. A truly masterpiece, which tells the lesson that hope never ever dies, live your life",10
"This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.4 stars out of 4",10
"Maybe it's silly but sometime when I face a tough situation in my life and I feel powerless and hopeless; I remember how Andy dug a tunnel with his rock hammer for 19 years, 19 YEARS.. to gain his freedom.
For me it's simple. This movie gives me hope.",10
"This film is perfect in every sense of the word. The second the movie starts it grabs you and holds your attention for the rest of the film. It is never boring. All of the hints that lead to the finale is absolutely genius, and the attention to detail is perfect. The third act is the best of all time. Roger Deakins gives one of his more subtle works, and it plays out beautifully. The dialogue is perfect, and you deeply care about the characters.",3
"In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. It's probably my favorite movie. It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but, the first time you watch it when you don't know what is about to happen, is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about the ending and for god's sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made.  There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most.  I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would have been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough. It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had to sit back breathless.  I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned.  A true classic!",3
"''The Shawshank Redemption'' is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story. The story is excellent,the time has just flew with this movie. This movie just gets better with every showing. There's no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Everyone must watch this movie.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",10
"An analysis of prison life--and of what hope can be in a prison--Frank Darabont's first film is one of the best ever.  Well-written and well-acted, the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming, endearing, poignant.  Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous--it's simply extraordinary drama.",10
"First when I saw how huge the overall rating  was I wondered why. But then I told myself I should give it try, and truly it was totally worth it period. I miss this kind of movies. sush a masterpiece, it contain many lessons and significances about our life I'm still wondering how this masterpiece didn't win a oscar then I figured out that it is a small thing comparing this movie and if you don't watch it yet then you have miss a big part from your life",10
"I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption"" is an absolute masterpiece that effortlessly weaves together themes of hope, friendship, and the enduring human spirit. With impeccable performances from its cast, particularly Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film transports you into the gritty world of prison life while also touching your heart with its poignant storytelling. The expertly crafted plot, rich character development, and unexpected twists make it a timeless classic that leaves an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to watch it. The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic gem. Its powerful portrayal of hope, friendship, and resilience, along with standout performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, creates an unforgettable experience. The film's masterful storytelling, character growth, and surprising turns make it an enduring classic. A must-watch that tugs at your heart and mind.",10
"I am pretty sure I have watched it more than 50 times now , and I will watch it a 100 times more, shared the experience of this work of art and recommended it to many many people because i felt it will be selfish to keep it to myself. The movie is ageless, timeless and pure, it sticks with you forever. The shawshank redemption isn't just a movie, it is a feeling.",7
"the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it.",6
"This is such a spectacular and mysterious movie.
The lead guy plays his role like a Loki.I first saw this movie back in high school.It was one of the best movies I seen during that time.
The story with out a doubt was remarkable. It's filled with twists and what the heck moments.",4
"To me this is one of the best told prison movies ever made. After watching the Blue Ray Version - it is more than a prison movie too. While Morgan Freeman's performance and narration are tour DE force, the support cast is outstanding. Even the ancient James Whitmore has a good role in this one.I noted on the credits that Steven King contributed to his writing being converted into a movie. There is no doubt this one benefits from that. Tim Robbins is at the top of his game here too. Frank Darabont directs and writes this movie and the viewer gets the feeling that the director pictured how the story should be told when he wrote it along with when he directed it.This movie is the ultimate trip about injustice and justice within the prison system. It draws deep characters for each role which seem to take advantage of each cast members skills. It also is a the ultimate triumph over despair. Bob Gunton gets kudos from here for his role as the warden.When your looking for a movie to watch, there are few to beat this picture as this one just turned out perfect. If every film were this well done, they would all be best pictures.",8
"Few movies in this world are as powerful as The Shawshank Redemption. This well-crafted drama drags your emotions through the wringer, only to have them come out clean & full of hope on the other side. The story is unquestionably compelling and absolutely memorable. In addition, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast create a collage of authentic characters that you both love & hate. This is a film that everyone should watch at least once a year to remind themselves of how good it really is.",10
"This is the best movie ever, I have watched a lot of movies and this one is the best of them all. The end irks great and it is just so damn good, watch the damn movie.",7
"The best jailhouse movie of all time! Right next to The Green Mile!What we have here is another classic collectible. If you have or have not seen this film, it's one of those that have to be in your DVD collection... a film to pass down to the younger generation to inspire them on how film-making should be done.An all star cast with outstanding performances and directing!If you don't own this, add it to your collection!A perfect and well deserves 10/10 from me!",10
"The film's been IMDb's #1 for as long as I can remember. That doesn't really raise my expectations, considering I don't agree with so many inclusions or exclusions. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best Picture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked it, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is fantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. When I saw this movie I was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special.I also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding) made one of the best performances of their life. Deserves to be noted that Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) made an also good performance.I really recommend this movie to you and I am sure that you will love it because it's a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.",3
"Little more than average drama for popular tastes. Predictable,  overly sentimental, and excessively long.It's a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is at number 2 in the all time chart! However, predictably it's not in the top 100 more serious 'Sight and Sound'  critics and directors polls that are held every  ten years. Frank Darabont later proved to be no master with his two following films, the second rate 'The Green Mile' and the truly appalling 'The Majestic'. The fact that this pedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of  real masters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation.",10
"This film is a classic that stands on its own. The initial release was very low-key and it actually bombed at the box office, only gaining appreciation after many more years of being shown on TV purely on its own merits. The premise is deceptively simple as it revolves around innocent inmate Andy and his smuggler friend Red. Beyond that, there are many more characters and moments that add to the brutal portrayal of life in prison and change Andy's life in many ways across the twenty years he is in there. I would say it's expansive but purposeful, as all the scenes and story elements all tie in together for a single reason, no matter how irrelevant they may seem at the time. That reason is hope - no matter where you are, there is always a Zihuantanejo.",7
"It's a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme (""End Titles"" on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled: Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as ""fresh fish."" There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963's 'Great Escape"" references with the socks. I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, ""I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie"". Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is actually a short novel written by Stephen King. Tim Robbins is falsely imprisoned for the murder of his wife. He becomes best friends with Morgan Freeman and plots an escape using a small hammer to slowly create an opening in the wall which is covered with posters.Freeman narrates the story and he and Robbins make a terrific pair struggling to survive prison life while keeping their sanity. They manage to make it through their days by dreaming of the perfect escape. King has written a tale of hope and inspiration which is adapted with great style and grace by Frank Darabont. He later made King's Green Mile in 1999, another excellent prison drama.",10
10 stars is to little for this film its one of the best of all time and it deserves every praise it have,10
"Not much to say that hasn't been said. Great acting, character development, and plot. It's the ultimate story of overcoming adversity. Movies like this aren't made anymore and it is saddening.",10
"First off... I really liked ""The Shawshank Redemption"".It's a movie that is comfortable with itself,it knows exactly what it is - a good prison story with excellent performance from the leads and a happy ending.It was never intended to be a cult masterpiece,that status has become an ""aftermarket accessory"",so to speak. With only a ""so - so"" initial reaction nobody concerned could have imagined it would be elevated to the pantheon of movie greats. I suspect that in a world desperate for good to be recognised and evil punished,a world where the small man was becoming increasing powerless against ""Them"",heroes like Andy and Red,abundantly decent and ""ordinary"" raged against the machine on the audience's behalf. Movies about good vs evil whether ""Star Wars"", ""Lord of the Rings"" or the later ""Harry Potter"" series have built huge followings largely on that basis. Mr King's original novella could not have produced such an affect,it needed a movie with all its immediacy and impact to open out his story and punch his message to the audience. Whilst a book may be put aside and continued later,thus weakening its affect,a movie is seen in its entirety in a relatively short space of time - no distractions. There has always one small thing that has bothered me for years.... How did Andy hang his poster of Rita Hayworth back up covering the hole in his cell wall after he had escaped? That apart,""The Shawshank Redemption""is a completely satisfying prison story,bringing up to date the old George Raft,James Cagney movies from the 30s and 40s. Many people,for whom it has a special message,think it amongst the finest films ever made.",10
"A man is sent to prison and has to learn to adapt to prison life,, there he meets a wise old gentleman who he befriends, and there friendship grows immensely. along the way he meets different prison characters, all of which are very likable... adapted from a short short by Steven King,, this is a powerful movie,, showing prison life in the early 20 th century. Tim Robbins was wonderful in this and should have won an award,, Morgan freeman is captivating in his role as ""Red"" , Our main character, Andy Dufrene plans a prison break and needs the help of several of the inmates.. I wont' say what happens after his attempted prison break,, but this is a touching movie, with a lot of character development, and not much on the action,, but it really doesn't need to have a lot of action,, lot's of humor abound, a movie about growing up in person, and the people that you might, and the life struggles of being in prison,, excellent movie.. but not the greatest of all time,,, I can think of at least 10 better .",10
"One of my all time favorites.It is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",10
"Tim Robbins as Andy a successful banker that was arrested and charged, and sent to the Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover that he did not commit.Morgan Freeman as Red the longtime lifer who serves as narrator and friend to Andy. In order for Andy to help the young man cope with prison as Red is really used to it having lived there for years.Red is also a smuggling expert at contraband and gives people cigarettes, posters of Rita Hayworth to Andy among other things. As people at the prison look up to him. Red has also been denied parole so many times he looks at getting parole as useless along the way.Both must deal with the harsh reality of prison. As both need to lean on one another to survive. And Andy is beaten up by Mark Rolston, as Red and his thugs and after Red is beaten up himself and paralyzed as Andy is no longer bothered again. In the process, Andy is moved from the laundry job.Andy works with the corrupt warden Sam Norton(played evilly by Bob Gunton), and corrupt and sadistic guard Captain Hadley(Clancy Brown), in the prison library and fixes taxes and money laundering for them personally.Andy is placed in solitary confinement a couple of times, once for refusing to not keep on money laundering for the warden. Who in turn, would take away his job and the library he has been working at.As he really wants to be released as he did not commit the murders. And with the help of the little rock hammer that he gets from Red, to build rocks to play checkers with to pass the time in prison. He wants something more to do that than.Won't tell you nothing more as you have to see it for yourself. A movie of hope and encouragement. As it shows you should never, ever give up hope as that keeps you going.Robbins and Freeman make a great duo. And the chemistry between them looks really real. Great writing and great acting by them and the supporting players! Really you will love this movie if you had not seen it.",10
"Under the authorship of the horror king Stephen King, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" explores demons, but not the ones that that come at you at stab you with their pitchforks, no these demons are the ones that's hidden in you and finding ways to release them from your soul till eternity. Like his other masterpiece ""Stand By Me"", this is not the traditional horror fest that made King a cultural icon. Instead we have an old-school structured prison drama about two life-sentenced convicts who embark on a quest to break free from the isolation of prison to become free or die trying, whichever comes first.Located in the unforgiving atmosphere of the Shawshank prison cells with prisoners coming in by the dozens, the prison walls is just as much of scary place lie the Overlook Hotel only with chains and creaking walls to accompany every unsettling minute that comes about in this place that makes hell look like a tropical paradise. For more added effect, there's a raven that makes his home there and even has a name, Jake who's under the eyes of aging ex-murderer Brooks (James Whitmore) who works as the prison librarian. A lot of the cliches of prison life pays homage to the old-school prison camps with familiar characters like the Bible-preaching tyrant Warden (Bob Gunton) and a no-nonsense, short-tempered prison guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown).Starting his career directing B-movies (The Fly II) and forgettable TV movies like ""Buried Alive"", this was Frank Darabont's chance to show that he can direct films of a similar calibre like Spielberg or Scorsese by taking a rather old format approach to this prison story to make something refreshingly provocative and authentic at the same time. While observing the hell that is prison life with power-abusive guards, hypocritical Bible-thumping wardens and prison food that comes with a side of maggots, this story could explain things better than King's novella in changing the way we look at things and thank the creator for giving us the freedom we have as we speak.The main emphasis of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is on the progressive friendship involving two prisoners of a large age gap, the former banker tuned convicted wrongfully accused murderer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and regretful veteran prisoner Ellis "" Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). The opening scenes take place in 1947 as Dufresne was found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover and while he's trying to prove he is innocent of all convictions, there is evidence his footprints were at the scene and his irresponsible ways come to full effect as his hands were on the weapon. Andy was sentenced to life in jail where he'll like spend his years in Maine's unforgiving threshold of hell itself, The Shawshank prison. With a hobby that includes, reading, chess and rock-carving and his vast knowledge of finance and commerce, Andy is still a loner and therefore 30 year veteran prisoner Red starts to befriend him.Andy is not some incarcerated imbecile his powerful education and know-how has managed to turn his life for the better. When Captain Hadley was lamenting about tax collectors confiscating most of his inheritance money, Mr. Dufresne makes a negotiation of how Hadley can keep his full inheritance under the condition that they all get three free cold beers after working in the sun all day tarring the foundations on the roof.His knowledge in finance and investments soon begin to change the landscapes of prison life for not only his prison inmates, but for those those hard-nosed people who run the prison system. For the guards he's now filing their taxes while for his inmates he's earned enough money to transform a spider-web infested rundown library into a bigger facility for the inmates to take advantage of. And sure this was done in six years, Andy has become a symbol of perseverance.It's strange that we can watch a movie and be sympathetic to a convicted murderer but his message of determination makes us really care for him and hope that he'll be released anytime soon. That feeling of determination is passed down to friend Red who fears he'll suffer the same fate that Brooks did after being 50 years imprisoned only to lead him to suicide because he felt like a nobody in the real world with no friends or family.In return, Red's offering is the power of clemency. Where Andy fully explains what really happened the night when his wife was killed. He confesses that he does take some responsibility for his wife's death and his asking for forgiveness is that turning point to this very well acted and directed movie.Though sadly snubbed by the Oscars, Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne evolves from a convicted killer ex-banker to a warm highly-respectable friend. Morgan Freeman gives a warm performance as a veteran prisoner who finds the power of optimism and his narration comes across as purposeful than self-serving like other films he's narrated.In the end, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" will likely fill your heads into thanking those around you that you have more freedom than you think in the outside world that should never be taken for granted. It also gives us the feeling that serving time is not the end of the line and no matter where you are if you serve your time wisely you might get rewarded in the long run and that we as humans hold the keys to our own prisons.",3
"To tell the truth before I saw this film and considering how it is the highest rated film on IMDB, I was very skeptical about how good it really was. While I may still not agree with its position at number one, I can understand where its revered status stems from.
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most inspiring films ever made. The story of how one man can transform a prison and the attitudes of all his fellow inmates with only his personal decency and hope. Tim Robbins perfectly captures the quiet, moral nature of Andy Dufesne and also brings an intangible element to the character which makes it such a compelling performance. The picture really has two leads the other being Morgan Freeman. Although on paper he might seem more supporting, Red could almost be called the lead character. Freeman has an illustrious career filled with strong performances but this one,I find to be,is his best. The chemistry he has with Robbins makes their characters' friendship so moving. Because the two work so well together the audience is honestly glad to see them reunited at the end(if you weren't I might suggest seeking help). And there's no question that was the right way to end the story. I know that might seem ridiculously obvious but such things can sometimes get jumbled up. The Shawshank Redemption is full of suffering, loss and pain but all of that would have no effect if it didn't end well. Endings should really drive a picture's message and sometimes that calls for a positive and at other times a more negative one. Films like High Noon or The Magnificent Ambersons lose nearly everything they stand for by ending well. But if Shawshank ended with Dufresne killing himself or something like that,everything it built up over its 142 minute runtime would be quickly forgotten.
Speaking of its length, I might add that the picture runs well for one of its size. I would be lying if I called it quick paced, it just isn't and quite frankly it's better off so.
The segment with Brooks(James Whitmore) isn't pivotal to the story;certainly not requiring the time it uses. Yet the film wouldn't be as good without that bitter moment of a harsh reality. Of course these scenes work because they are crafted so well by Frank Darabont.
Darabont has only directed five movies in his entire career which leaves us to wonder about his true potential. However, if you judge him by this picture alone(which might not be the most accurate measure)he's at the top of the league. His style blends excellently with this film and enhances its entire essence.
Since Darabont adapted Stepen King's novella, its difficult to assign praise to anyone as far as the writing is concerned. But no part of the writing is inferior to any other aspect of the film.The picture is an inspiring tale about freedom and containment,good and evil,love and hate. And how simple kindness can redeem, even when existing in a place as harsh as Shawshank State Prison.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film with a perfect cast and a wise plot. It had its good times, had entertainment and lead us to some reflections about life. Sadly it had some predictable conversations and seemed to be just another Morgan Freeman's movie. It dares to almost offend our intelligence the fact that the prison officers didn't check that poster carefully one single time in twenty years. And I have two questions: was the American justice that weak back in 1994? Were the condemned all smart and good people as this movie portrayed?If it deserves to be at 1st spot here? Maybe. If it became one of my favorite movies? No, just a good watch.",6
"Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank 2 in the top 250, in front of LotR3, where it belongs. I've seen this movie about 20 times and I never get tired of it. That's what makes a movie the best. The first 2 in the top 250 are where they belong. The 3 LotR-movies should be out of the top 10. They should create a category for special effects. Put them on top there. But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects. The story of Shawshank is absolutely great. The actors did their best. It's still a shame, that this great movie didn't got a single Oscar. It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners.",10
"When I seen this movie in Top250, I could not believe it, thought it was a joke. It is probably some boring old movie, maybe even without colors. But I was amazed. Similar to Prison Break series, just older version of it. Adventure, Lesson, Inspiration, Motivation, Insight, Experience, Confidence, Emotions...all in one. Good ending too. It lacks nothing. It teaches us to fight for freedom, and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards, but freedom from people, diseases, poor life, anything negative or bad. It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it.",6
"Wish I could go back in time and see it for the first time again, because the story moved me deeply. Fantastic movie all the way through, not a single issue to report here.",10
Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen.Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.,5
"An interesting movie with good performances. It's basically about hope and hold it together. It is the final outcome that matters the most.Is about 2 imprisoned men who bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. Robbins, Freeman and the supporting cast is good enough.I don't think it is worthy to be the #1 movie in the IMDb though. That's just not possible.I know that ""debate"" started between TSR and TDK.Anyway a good overall movie. especially if you are into prison dramas, then this movie is for you.",7
"Darabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a maximum security prison with a tough warden (Gunton). Andy (robbins) befriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone of the film, Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is the actor's best performance of all time. This is Freeman's film, though Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an antagonist. Everything about this film is perfect, so i can completely see why its the 3rd best film of all time on IMDb. I am a big fan and have watched it 5 times and wouldn't mind on seeing it again later down the line. IMDb Rating: 9.2 MY Rating: 10/10",10

Either get busy living, or get busy dying."" life is a beach or so they say",10
"With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood.",10
A film directed by Frank Darabont. Starring Tim Robbins. At first I was retissant but when I knew that in this film there was this sublime actor who is Morgan Freeman. Anyone who spends time watching TV and watching movies should have seen this movie at least once in their lives. It is a great sadness for me to learn that Morgan Freeman did not win the Oscar for this film.,3
"My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. Actually, the movie itself is nothing special, but it has some good stuff. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those Croatian films that were popular back in the 1990s. My final rating comes in at seven out of 10 stars.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that people either love or  well, hate is probably the wrong word.It's an OK film, but lacks in so many areas, most of all script and ideas. Yet again, we are subjected to an innocent man being sent to prison, governed by a sadistic guard and corrupt governor. Yet again, we see him get a glimmer of hope of release, and yet again we see hope destroyed.It's not exactly original.But, it is well filmed, and superbly acted. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played the lead roles to perfection. The surrounding parts were played as equally well, and none let the film down. Pity about the script.Don't get me started about the poster on the wall. All the searches, and no-one took it down? Oh, come on.Watch the film  yes, even enjoy it. But please don't think it's one of the best.",5
"The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job, and that is saying something. Freeman is the greatest actor of all time. Secondly, Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in the end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW! It is awesome and will never be topped.",10
"Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times before they get into it. And read the short story just as many times. This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if you are a fan of Stephen King's short story.",10
That was alot af time passing that I wanted to watch this film but something was avoiding me ... I do'nt know what was that but finally I decided to watch and I surprised... what a beautiful movie is this ...,4
"***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film Institute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100 Years...100 Movies list. On this, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was listed at #72. I find it insulting it was ranked so low.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of King's works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery, The Green Mile, etc.) but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who don't know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a banker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film's narrator who has a reputation for being able to ""get things"" from the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the best of friends as the years go by, during which time Andy's financial knowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt Warden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering operation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time in prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and maintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at the conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace through his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency that, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an excellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography. While the characters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless trapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the dark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins' lead performance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is delivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions are perfect in capturing the character's calm, laconic yet hopeful demeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and deserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His narration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience. Particularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof of why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and deserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics and viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabont's skill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's skills as actors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of filmmaking and is up there with ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone with the Wind."" One of the greatest achievements in cinema in recent times.",6
"Everyone talks about the ""best ever"". But how can you Judge the best? Shawshank is one of those movies that is one of those ""the best film ever"". It has all the elements that make it stand out fro the rest. Morgan Freeman makes this film, his acting and more importantly, his voice in the narrative. The 'critics"" wrote this movie off; what do they know? This is one of the best movies of all time, and there are some awesome creations to stand up amongst. Shawshank is a legend of the movie world.",10
"That you want a sequel.I didn't want it to end and I never say that. This is the first one where I said, 'More Please.'The acting, screenplay, lesson it imparts and ending are perfect.Ignore my review however. Go watch a bunch of remakes and gender switches, franchise boys.",10
"Wow! All the good reviews about this movie have already been said, saying something else will be repetitive but watched this movie when I was just 11 years old, barely understood the whole plot. This movie just go re-released in 4K today (14/09/2021) and I bought it to add to my digital library collection and after watching it for real this time I'm totally speechless... Just get this movie, no more comments. This is EPIC👌🏾",10
The Shawshank Redemption :-Classic Prison Break Movie.Worth Watching .9.3 in IMDB Worth for its Hype and Ratings .Fast Paced Movie . Intriguing.Interesting Dailogues .Pre Climax Scenes were 🔥🔥🔥🔥.,7
"This movie is annoying in several ways.  The criminals are all goodhearted, thoughtful, sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys.  gimme a break.  What is this?  Dukes of Hazard? (which was far better than this).  Further, the plot is so, so, so predicable.  Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served. spare me.  I know, a lot of people love this flick, but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time.",10
"This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again. Each time I see it, I learn more and more.  Like figuring out the joke about ""salvation lies within.""  I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy.  It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within.  This movie has everything a movie needs.  It makes you laugh, cry, and feel really good, giving you a feeling of hope.",10
"I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film. Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry, but I found it utterly average.  I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie.  Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was. Sorry.",10
"The first time, i saw this movie, i had a big smile in my face, because of the excellent ending of the movie. It's a high Quality movie in every sense. I do like that story, the writing is great. I think, the movie is even better than the book of Steven King. The directing is great. The cut is perfect, the art direction is great. The Sound and Soundtrack fits perfect into the movie. I don't know even one aspect, why i should not like it. It's the all time number one for me. That means, it is my absolute first place. The perfect movie! It's a great film about humanity under bad conditions. So everyone can see, that even in bad places is humanity. And even if there are bad People who want to break humanity between others with their might and power, they can't really destroy it. And the movie knocks down facades of deceitfulness. I like that! Sorry, if my English is bad. It's not my mother language. :) Greetings. :)",3
"This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over your face, hope is still your last hope.One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What would you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well, Andy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he weren't in this movie, the movie would have lacked something for sure.There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.",8
"One of the best movies ever,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were so good.",9
"I have to admit that I've discovered the existence of this movie by looking to the top rated movies on IMDb and this one has the highest rank of all the films ever made. I was clearly curious, why so high? Why this movie in particular is the best according to the other IMDb's users? Well after watching it I can say that it's not something wrong to have The Shawshank Redemption so high. It's not my favorite film ever but it's a very very good one that I'll suggest everyone who didn't see it to go and watch it. This movie is great in every aspect: performances, direction, plot, settings... But what makes it so great is that it provokes a lot of emotions in the viewers that stay with them for a while after the viewing. There are a lot of powerful moments and scenes and they are all well built in order to have more impact. And furthermore the movie is also able to stimolate a reflexion about various topics about prisons system, justice and human nature in general. In conclusion The Shawshank Redemption is clearly a must-watch, don't lose this masterpiece.",6
"It has been argued for years whether this movie deserves its fame or not. Some say that it is overrated and others say that it is the best movie ever made. What I can say is that it is true that this movie is a bit overrated but it still deserves to be called a masterpiece.There is something about The Shawshank Redemption that creates a specific atmosphere and makes you not only watch but experience it. I have read the book and I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie more. The combination of outstanding acting, great directing and well written script makes this movie the masterpiece it is.I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie except for its high place in the IMDB top 250's list. It is an amazing movie but it still doesn't deserve to be called the best as there are many others that are equally good or even better. But still, this movie should be on everyone's list of must watch movies.",10
"This isn't the type of movie that I would normally rave about. It's about the triumph of hope over despair, and friendship over division - it's a feel good movie.But the truth is I think The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely fantastic. When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than other feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful collision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that is Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent, simple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie. He's so different to almost any other prison break character you can imagine, and extremely engaging. And Tim Robbins is the perfect casting - he puts in the performance of a lifetime.Tim is very well supporting by Morgan Freeman as Red, and in fact the entire supporting cast does their job.The plot is interesting - it consists of a series of successes and falls for Andy. He keeps on picking himself and dusting himself down. You end up assuming that it's all going to end tragically, which I suppose why his final, spectacular triumph is so uplifting. Yes, it's unrealistic, but it certainly won me over!",8
"Well the thing with this movie is its message. While it might not be the first or only prison break movie, the way it's directed and its amazing cinematography and score has turned this average plot movie into a great movie. The dialogues are superb, mostly short and on-point! And the cherry on the cake is Morgan Freeman( specially his voice).It's a timeless movie that you'll re-visit time and time again and you'll watch the complete movie and protagonist's struggle just to get to that light of hope in the climax. Couldn't agree more on the fact that it must have been the most revisited movie of all time... And isn't that enough to make it the best movie of all time?",10
"I have a good friend that I can discuss movies with all day. Generally we have very similar tastes and critiques. Shawshank, is the only movie we completely disagree on. This movie insulted my intelligence from the first minute. All the prison clichés are painfully represented in this one film. The Innocent lead character, the benevolent inmate friend, the evil warden, the sadistic guard, etc.. Then of course you are mesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the attempted rape. About the only ingredient not thrown into this proverbial soup was a football game.This movie has some fine acting and direction, but considering its big name cast and production, the product is sophomoric at best.",10
"An outstanding movie about perseverance, brains and irony. It's certainly the greatest prison movie ever made. But there's a lot more involved than your average prison flick has to offer. Try character and character development for starters.The best thing King has written, I love ""Salems Lot"" but how can you top this one.",9
"When you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10",5
"I know 'Best Movie Ever' sounds like such a cliché, a phrase used to death. Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever. I believe that the phrase ' Best Movie Ever' should be reserved for one movie only. The Shawshank Redemption. Not so long ago on IMDb, The Shawshank Redemption was ranked 2nd. This, naturally, compelled me to buy it, and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movie.Simple plot, wonderfully acted and directed.Since watching The Shawshank Redemption, i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it. And here i must do the same. It is ranked #1 on IMDb for a reason. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it. If you haven't seen it, watch it.10/10",10
"Putting the words ""beloved"" and ""prison movie"" together may strike some as oxymoronic, like ""same difference"", but that's exactly what THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is. Released in the autumn of 1994 to indifferent box office, it became a true word of mouth phenomenon when it was released on home videocassette the following spring, ultimately becoming the most rented film of the year.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION first appeared as a Stephen King short story entitled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". Frank Darabont was a veteran television writer and director who was yet to make his big screen debut. Being a personal friend of King's, Darabont was able to purchase the rights for a very small amount. After completing the screenplay, he secured a deal to direct with Castle Rock, and given a budget of $25 million to work with.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was set in King's home state of Maine -naturally- but Darabont and his scouts could not find an abandoned penitentiary that fit the aesthetics described by King. They checked out neighboring states and even in Canada...but no such luck. Eventually, they found what they were looking for in the Ohio State Reformatory, which was chosen for its Gothic style architecture. The prison had been closed for just a couple of years following decades of complaints about its living conditions. Cast and crew later described it a sad place, almost as if the ghosts of inmates past were communicating with them.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have achieved cinematic immortality for their portrayals of Andy Dufresne and Ellis ""Red"" Redding. It's 1947 Maine,and Dufresne is an aloof banker convicted for the double murders of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life at Shawshank, he and other ""fresh fish"" are paraded and cruelly taunted by the established inmates who take bets over which one of the new arrivals will crack first. Among a small clique of cons, Red selects Andy to be the one who'll break down, but Dufresne costs him 200 cigarettes by not making a single sound during the night.The guards are just as bad as most of the inmates, best exemplified by the brutal Captain Hadley, who beats a new prisoner to death for refusing to stop weeping. Warden Sam Norton is the ""good cop"" to Hadley's ""bad cop"", a sanctimonious man who believes in dishing out both the Bible and harsh discipline with equal measure.Being one of the new kids in town, it isn't too long before Andy becomes an unwanted object of attention -affection hardly seems the right word- from the sodomites of Shawshank. Dufresne finds solace when he gets to know Red, a lifer also doing time for murder. Behind bars, Red is known as the guy who get anything for anyone, a ""regular Sears and Roebuck"" as he describes himself. He may have made peace with himself over his crime, but that doesn't mean he'll get parole, as he's met with rejection from the board every ten years.If Red is the Sears and Roebuck of Shawshank, then Andy is the H&R Block. His financial acumen comes in handy during his stretch when he becomes an accountant for the warden and guards at tax time.",10
"What to say about this movie. I still regret not watching it after several recommendations. This is a complete masterpiece. All the actors have done great job.Now talking about the movie it has a very deep message. It says hope is the thing a man should always have. Fear can hold you a prisoner but hope can set you free. And being free doesn't mean freedom from prison, but from negative thoughts that brought you down here. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shared a great bond of throughout the movie and we really do care about them. It is a masterpiece and one must watch it at least once in his/her life....",10
"Putting the words ""beloved"" and ""prison movie"" together might strike some as slightly oxymoronic ~akin to ""same difference"" or ""civil war ""~ but a beloved prison movie is exactly what THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is. Released in the autumn of 1994 to indifferent box office, SHAWSHANK became a true word of mouth phenomenon when it emerged on home videocassette the following spring, ultimately becoming the most rented film of the year. If nothing else, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION also serves as an excellent argument proving that failed gate receipts have absolutely no bearing on a movie's quality. Need any further examples? How about CITIZEN KANE and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE?THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION first appeared in print as a Stephen King short story entitled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". The author's friend Frank Darabont logged in many years in the entertainment field as a television director and writer, but was yet to make his motion picture debut. Due to his personal amity with King, Darabont persuaded him to sell the rights for a very small amount. After completing the screenplay, Darabont secured a deal with Castle Rock to direct THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, and was given a budget of $25 million to work with.Like most of King's works, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was set in his home state of Maine ~where else?~ but Darabont and his scouts could not find an abandoned penitentiary that fit the aesthetics described by the author. They tried checking out the neighboring states and even in Canada...but no such luck.Eventually, they found what they were looking for in the Ohio State Reformatory, which was chosen for its Gothic architectural style. The prison had been closed for just a few years following decades of complaints about its living conditions. Cast and crew would later describe the place as a sad place, almost as if the ghosts of inmates past were somehow communicating with them.It's 1947, and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murders of his wife and her lover. An introverted loner who keeps to himself, Andy's as challenging to read as ""Brave New World"". When he and the new prisoners ~nicknamed ""fresh fish""~ arrive at Shawshank Prison, they are mercilessly taunted by the inmates, who always gamble on which fish will break down in tears on his first night. The guards can be a handful too, particularly the brutal Captain Hadley, who beats a new arrival to death because he wouldn't stop crying.Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), serving as the story's narrator has also served twenty years of a life sentence for murder, and was recently denied parole. In Shawshank, Red describes himself as ""a Sears and Roebuck"", the man known to get anything for anyone on the inside just shy of a cake with a file baked inside. As the newcomers are....um, greeted by the not-so-welcome wagon, he places his bet on Andy as the one to crumble on his first night, but Dufresne costs him 200 cigarettes by not saying a single word.Andy's first two years are pure misery as he becomes the repeated victim of unwanted attention from the sodomites. He finds solace through an unexpected friendship with Red, the self-described ""only guilty man at Shawshank"". Dufresne' finance acumen comes in handy when he becomes the personal H&R Block for Warden Sam Norton, a pious man whose religious convictions are more compatible with the Old Testament than the New.Soon, Andy is the prison's unofficial accountant, preparing tax returns for not only every guard at Shawshank but also for corrections officers from other state facilities. Because his services include money laundering for Norton, Dufresne gains special privileges in which he shares some of those perks with Red and their clique of fellow convicts.As the years stretch on, the bond between Andy and Red grows stronger as they console each other through their various disappointments. However, in 1963, a new convict arrives at Shawshank who may be able to prove Dufresne's Innocence, something he has insists on from day one. But Norton, who by now is as corrupt as the men he rules over, is anxious not to lose his cash cow, and will do anything to ensure that Andy never receives his day of absolution.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have achieved cinematic immortality with their portrayals of Andy and Red. Robbins brings dimension ~and humor~ to a character who could best be described as a riddle within an enigma. In Dufresne's later scenes after he and the warden had a falling out, the bitterness in his eyes and voice has Red genuinely concerned about his mental health....and us too!Freeman received his third Academy Award nomination for his performance as Red. In the spirit of past masters such as Spencer Tracy, he's a keeper of the minimalist ""remember your lines and don't bump into the furniture"" acting style of Tracy's to convey his characterization. Freeman evinces a world weary dignity to a man who's given up any hope of parole; Red declines to bait first nighters like his colleagues, but he doesn't put on airs of superiority either. He just knows he has to hold his head sufficiently high enough in order to survive.Darabont's big screen directorial debut is quietly effective, with the tone shifting fluidly from brutal to amusing to heartwarming without the climax coming across as mawkish. The final scene where Andy and Red are reunited on the Pacific coast ~which looks suspiciously like it was shot in the Caribbean~ was not originally scripted. Its intended fade to black ending had Red's bus heading to Fort Hancock Texas but an advanced preview screening prompted suggestions of an actual reunion of the two men. So, giving the people what they want, the filmmakers brought Robbins, Freeman, and the crew back for a single day's reshoot. It was one of those extremely rare occasions when pre-release audience feedback was clearly beneficial insofar as an artistic standpoint.Currently, on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is ranked at the numbers one spot just ahead of THE GODFATHER. Although I don't personally believe that it's better than THE GODFATHER (few films are), THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has certainly earned its place at the table. 🔚",10
"It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart.",10
"Let me tell you a little story. I am 17 years old and consider myself an avid movie buff. From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindler's List to The Matrix, I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies. After being desensitized by the poor gore-fest known as Hostel, I came home and watched this movie with some friends. Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up. I don't do it often, and I certainly wasn't expecting to tonight. But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul. It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time. Please go see this in its entirety if you have not.",10
"Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge...",10
"From the summary above which you will have seen, i stated the film to be a moving masterpiece. Right from the word go i was drawn into the films twisting emotional plot. It caught my attention that Frank Darabont has placed a small amount of aspects into the film that get the audience emotionally involved in which we base ourselves into simply putting our feet in one of the convicts shoes. Tt especially caught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks (James Whitmore) takes his own life, the non-diagetic sound adding to the other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the tragic loss of the character in which we have been following through the course of the film. The cinematography throughout the film was basic and what i would term as standard, seen before basic film camera-work. If this was better it would have highly improved the films overall watch. throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her lover. We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at Shawshank Prison. We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a nimble, lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden. This all becomes of the fact that in Dufresne's previous life he was a city banker, which is where he gets the nickname of 'wife murdering banker' around the dim lit prison. Morgan Freeman also shows that he is one of the worlds leading role- modelling actors as he pulls of another supreme unique perform. The way he acts during the duration of the film is entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and performs single handed an outstanding performance.The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters getting into difficult situation and how they overcome them, or not.The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would term as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end. As suspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must watch!I generally don't watch films more than once or twice but this is a different story. It still amazes me to this day and still gets me moving every time, it also influences me a lot.If you haven't watched this i highly recommend you do so!Joe Ferrari",7
"TSR is a movie about prisoners searching for freedom. This movie contains many good acting, good story, and good cinematography. Altough it cant stand among superior classic movies, but it is prudent to tell TSR is a complete package of entertainment. TSR is a core of prison-escape genre.This movie is an art of philosophy.",10
"I'm not going to go in detail about the brilliance of the Shawshank Redemption; it would be too much and the most haas already been said.
For me,it is a tie between this and 1960's Psycho as the best movie ever.
It does what nearly no movie does. It climbs through your skin, into your soul.
If you have watched it already, go watch it again and if you have not, go buy yourself a blu ray and watch it. There's nothing more to say about it. If there was ever a 11/10 movie, the Shawshank Redemption would be this movie.",10
"It seems that every time a movie comes out with an exceedingly positive and uplifting message or story, the average moviegoer is blind to any other problems or shortcomings the film might have. Every moment of this film feels phony and hollow. The character of Red (Morgan Freeman) is just a vehicle to keep the plot moving and doesn't seem to even exist as a whole person. His narration is embarrassing with its phony regional dialect and forced folksiness. The prison life depicted, while brutal and violent in a few scenes, is overromanticized by the picturesque cinematography and florid music. The plot is fairly clever but, like bad American television, everything that happens is in service of the plot. There's no behavior from the characters that doesn't help bring you to the film's stunningly maudlin final scene. And there are logistical problems, like the fact that you can't make a hole in a thick metal sewer pipe by hitting it with a rock three times. They could have solved this problem by just showing a shot of a clock moving forward. The best character is a relatively brief and peripheral one, Brooks (James Whitmore). Whitmore doesn't seem to know he's in such a shallow, contrived movie and gives the character a realism and three-dimensionality the other characters don't have in his short time on screen. In the montage-type scene in which he's trying to cope with life out of prison, however, he suddenly seems less intelligent and more of a stereotype of a befuddled old man. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is somewhere between good and mediocre, seeming to force weird expressions onto his face like he just read the character description in the script for the first time. Bob Gunton as Warden Norton is over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional, but it works because Bible-thumpers are often over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional. He's actually believable and interesting to watch. The prison guard Hadley (Clancy Brown) is realistically sadistic, but his type of comically crude sexual language sounds too contemporary for the time. The final scene is just so unrealistically over-the-top happy and sunny it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence and, I think, ruins much of the film. This film obviously has developed a huge following over the years, but I think that's largely just because of it's sentiment of hopefulness and positivity, and that doesn't necessarily indicate a well-written, well-executed, well-acted film. Some of the worst crap in theatres and on television has a hopeful, inspiring, uplifting message. Of course a film doesn't have to depict a realistic world. In fact, I like surrealism in movies. But it should at least show an interesting version of a world, and to keep any intelligent viewer's attention the characters have to be fully realized, seemingly existing in a world outside of the film's plot.",10
When I first saw this film I wasn't that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice it's Symbolism. The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice. Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy Dufranse.This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics.,10
"I'm one of those repetitive mucks who'll watch the same movie every weekend for three months or until I feel I've had enough.  Shawshank is one of those films I have seen at least ten times and yet, it is still new.  The truth is, you're never really immune to the human drama portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both excellent here. This is not a feel-good Friday night flick.  It's about injustice, desperation, the overcoming of that desperation, and the will to live regardless of time or circumstance. Shawshank set no records at the box office and was largely ignored until gradually, it was recognized as the masterpiece it undoubtedly is.  Roger Ebert attributes the movie's financial flop to its unassuming name.I noticed the film is right at the top of the IMDB's Top 250 films list, and rightfully so!!!  Some movies have one or two really glorious scenes.  But Shawshank is one continuing memorable scene.  There is not one line of stale dialogue or awkwardness.  I can't do it justice here, so do yourself a favor and rent it NOW.",10
"Lets say things, Tim Robbins gave one of the best acting performances of all time. As well as Morgan Freeman and every other actors. Let's just talk about Bob Gunton! His role sticked so much, every time i see him in other movies i can't stop thinking about The Shawshank Redemption! All the characters are so well portrayed that you feel anger, happiness and sadness about them. The simplicity of the scenes and all the little things that makes them special is priceless. The music is great. It succeeds in showing the sadness of society, the evil greedy mind of people, the good hart of other and the happiness of living free. It also portays that hope can drive us really far, even if we are prisoners. Even if this movie is not my number one, it surely deserves the number one spot on IMDb.",6
"This film is about hope, friendship and redemption. It has solid performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the warden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope, redemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes, the other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn't allow prison to break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the prison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad things yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you've gotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you're gonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human spirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great job of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released, he struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become institutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone, afraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to bear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me every time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges that Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only thing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman narrates:""There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe they'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.""It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you could see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over Freeman's face, fantastic acting if you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the redemption is Andy's. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of Red's redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he had given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing, Red was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There's a great scene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets him one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red picks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is where Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to his crime:""There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a bleep.""It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time favorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it's nothing short of movie magic. And the ending? Well, let's just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. An incredibly powerful, uplifting story. If you haven't seen this, you need to.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene. Although Andy's innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just think how he's going to get out of it.For me, the power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in. I'm not sure why this affected me so much but i think it's just the fact that one mistake forced these people to live in a certain way where they don't want so much freedom and they're used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn't adapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or something.Although the men are supposed to be 'cold hearted killers', they seem so nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to feel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and acting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except for some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i just wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the movie.If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first time they've seen it...i think it's a sign that if the person reading this still hasn't...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most definitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250.",10
"This is a very, very, very, great film. It's my all time favorite. First of all the acting is f**king great. My favorite actor in the entire film is easily Morgan Freeman. He should have won that Oscar! The fact that he didn't is a f**king disgrace. Now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. Now the story line is brilliant. Andy Dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover, so he is sentenced to Shawshank State Prison. There he develops a friendship with a prisoner named Red. The sets in this movie are great. As expected. So in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out.",10
"And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film. The last fifteen minutes are so wonderful it made me cry - and the only other film that has made me cry is the climax of The Truman Show. This is a film that makes you see life in a completely different way - a hopeful way. Don't watch some shallow nonsense like Mission Impossible II, watch a film that you'll remember your entire life. Watch The Shawshank Redemption. It's got 9 out of 10 for a reason, you know.",10
"Absolutely the most movie overrated i have seen ..
There are movies that deserve this rated and have not been talked about.. As for this movie, it is worth watching, but it does not deserve this rating.",10
"Enough has been said of this masterpiece, so I'll keep my review succinct. This truly is my favorite movie of all-time, because no matter how many times I see it, I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect; from the cinematography, to the acting, the casting, the writing...everything. It's a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it, you just know that every scene is classic; so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything, it just keep getting better with each time I see it. I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.",10
"Belonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I normally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I always thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the Shawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie instantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter how dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the end of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning bright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all around you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if your light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that moment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down about anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to watch.",10
"Best movie of all time for a reason, even after more than 20 years nothing have come close to it.",10
"In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film ever made. The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to perfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is designed to make you think, and boy does it do its job. The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way it cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be proud that a film like this originated from his book. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie. I don't think anyone could give it lower than a 7. The film will appeal to anyone, if not everyone, and will leave you vey satisfied long after the credits roll.",10
"I do not know, what to say, I am just bored. Many people say that is the best Movie? False",10
"There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I don't care what anyone's take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.",6
"I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole storyline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life.Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail, Morgon Freeman says ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright"" This movie has entertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short everything we want to see in a movie.I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life",10
"Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in one of the best movies ever made",8
"I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn't want to see it on video either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. ""I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards"". Fortunately for me, this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it, quite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case) is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can ""get things"" befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say ""Watch this - its the best film ever made"".",9
"it is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule , and its really worth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon, but in this film I've seen just so, I said it deserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have really found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display, but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century, and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.",10
"I rarely post comments on movies unless I, {A) Really love it, (B) Really hate it. This falls in the 'really love' category. The first time I watched this picture, I thought it was great, but much to dark and emotional, and contained unnecessary violence/sexuality. After viewing it 2 or 3 times, I finally understand why this movie is so highly ranked by IMDb regulars, and I also have come to understand why the scenes of violence and brutality toward Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) were included in this film. I also understand why James Whitmore's character Brooks Hatlen behaved the way he did. It was all the nastiness that happened to people we really like that makes the victory complete at the end. 5 years ago I would have called The Shawshank Redemption an overrated, self-indulging unnecessarily dark picture deserving a rating of 5 or perhaps 6 at best. Now that the move is nearly 12 years old, and now that I've watched it enough to finally ""get it"", I must agree with the masses and score this with a 9+. One of the best movies ever made and certainly the best of the Stephen King adaptations. How could I have been so obtuse?",9
"I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship, honesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in a prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again.",10
"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact.",10
"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A good tagline for a great prison drama from writer/director Frank Darabont (The Green Mile), based on the book by Stephen King. Basically Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is the lawyer convicted for the murder of his wife, sent to Shawshank prison, headed by the nasty Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). While he is there he is quiet for a while, but eventually he forms a friendship with black Irish marketeer Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman, and the character was originally a white red haired Irishman), retains hope and gains respect of fellow inmates. After a while, he gets to do a lot of personal work for the Warden sorting documents, founding a new library and improving a lot of other things, with his law and mathematical skills. One day though, he seems strange towards Red when he asks him to find a specific tree somewhere he knows, and the next morning, he has escaped (scraping through the soft wall with a chisel). Andy and Red do eventually find each other again in the happy emotional ending, well, many moments in the film are emotional. It was a flop in the cinemas, and since release to video and DVD it has become a favourite with many film goers. Also starring William Sadler as Heywood, Clancy Brown as Captain Byron T. Hadley, Gil Bellows as Tommy and James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Morgan Freeman was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the scene where classical operatic music plays in the prison, it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 13 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. After watching that movie for the first time, I remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. It is beautifully written and directed. The scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding reunite at the end of the movie. This promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. Even though these two men have lived in prison for years, they eventually got out (well Andy escaped) and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives, each other. I recommend this movie to all ages. Although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it, but after several other times, it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10!",8
"This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentimenttossed in. I really don' t understand the fuss. I guess some peoplelook for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling, palatable materiallike this. That's the only explanation I've got for the unwarrantedpopularity of this flick. Production credits are fine enough, as is theacting but it certainly doesn't belong on any repsectable list ofgreatest films of all time.",10
"I had this movie in my watch list for so many days but didn't watch it going by the title and the cover image. After watching it, I see that the movie didn't do well in box office for the same reason: strange title, unrelated cover image and confusions over marketing.
But after watching it once, I want to watch it again and again. It is such an inspiration. Amazing acting and direction. Flawless, motivational and entertaining as well.
Once we watch movies like this and Forrest Gump, we just feel that other scores of movies we watched is just a waste of time.
Watch the movie, understand the lessons and adopt it. It surely adds value to our life, not just a couple of hours of time pass. What more: it is entertaining as well.",8
This is my favorite movie of all time. I have this movie in Physical format and I have it on digital and let me tell you that I will stop everything I'm doing if I catch it on cable. This movie has stood the test of time and each watch gets better. It has an epic feel to it. Freeman and Robbins absolutely kill it in this movie. Supporting cast is on point. The music will keep you in the moment and compliments the visuals till the very end.,10
"I have a friend who hasn't seen the Shawshank Redemption, and his comment was essentially this: ""I hate prison movies, and I hate religion movies, so I'm not gonna see a flick that has both aspects in it."" His loss. This movie, based on a Stephen King novella, is on my all-time top ten. Of course it has morals and many lessons we can learn, but bottom line, it is a great movie. Even though we know that Tim Robbins is innocent, he acknowledges his guilt on a more subtle level, his failure to be a good person. That he is in prison affords him the opportunity to become a ""good"" man for the first time in his life. He touches the soul of many inmates, in that he educates them in some of the finer things in life, namely, good music and great literature. (He corrects an inmate's pronunciation of Alexandre Dumas' last name from ""Dumbass"" to the correct ""Dumah"") The last quarter of the movie is spot-on great. We are always touched by redemption themes, just look at how popular ""Scrooge"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" have become over the years. Shawshank simply is too good to miss.",9
"I have just watched this movie and I still don't know what I've just seen. The way ""The Shawshank Redemption"" hit me on an emotional level was completely new to me. I was emotionally torn apart by this great piece of art. For some reason I have always avoided watching this movie because I didn't think that I'd like it as much as most people. But I was so wrong! I am in love with this movie! I have never seen such a heartbreaking and beautifully crafted movie such as this one. I fully and strongly recommend ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to everyone who still hasn't seen it. What a masterpiece! 10/10",10
"My Personal Rating 9.8/10 - This is one of the most beautiful film that i have watched, same thing on godfather the cinematography the acting the atmosphere are so beautifully crafted. this film leaves me speechless it almost change the way that i think, i do believe this movie has some lessons on it. the way Morgan Freeman narrates the movie is so beautiful.. the quotes too. i don't want to spoil anything. anyone should watch this film.",9
"Even in the worst place there is.. you can still hope for the best, dare to dream and achieve it.",10
"Stephen King is my favorite writer and I've read all of his books.  When I first learned of them making a movie of ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" I was excited. I'd always liked the story, and thought it would make a great movie.  But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't do the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's books.  But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing.  Very glad.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the very best movies from a Stephen King book ever made, and one of my favorite movies of all time.  My score-10.",9
"If you are looking for an inspiring jorney to feel the magic of life, you should stop searching and watch this title.",7
"This movie is intelligent, based on an excellent book played by legendary actor as Morgan Freeman. Directed by a true artist ( Frank Darabont), I hope that this movie will be remembered for many and many years, Probably the best Picture ever made in the all history. You need to see at least one time in your life.",10
"Quite simply a masterpiece in storytelling. It has everything, except maybe action, but then that's not what this film is about.Lock yourself away without distraction, and focus fully on this film, and it's only then you realise the messaging, acting skill, directing skill, pacing, everything when taken as a whole marks this film out as one of the best. Joyful, intriguing and sad in equal measure.Faults? None. End of.Anyone considering themselves a film buff needs to take a long hard look at themselves if this isn't in their top 10. It's in my top 3.",10
If stranded on a desert island I want this film to be there with me.... This film sits at the very top (with clear space) above any other film ever made.. The best of the best.. I cant remember (like most) this film coming out. I watched it like 97% off everyone else on DVD.. How this didn't get the bums on seats in the cinemas must have been a marketing balls up.. However DVD sales and now streaming services has helped this film become a favourite of many many people. Things to do in life before you die is to watch this film... not once but a few times.. this film ticks every box. Its wonderful..,8
"Ok.  It wasn't that bad.  In fact, there's a lot to like about this movie. But there was absolutely no reason why this movie needed to go on and on and on and on.Excellent acting of course:  Freeman is always right on target and Tim Robbins is very good (although I happen to dislike his political views and that inhibits my ability to imagine he's anyone else but Robbins up there on the screen).Its a movie that makes one think about the important things in life, and it does that without being preachy.However, I don't like the way it uses cliches all the way through, i.e. the bad warden who is a pseudo-Christian.  Hollywood has shown much hatred towards Christianity,  and this is only one more movie in a long string which tries to make Christians look bad.****spoilers ahead********
Also, it is simply not believable that (a) the prison would not have moved Andy in 19 years of prison life, and (b) the sound of his rock scraping wouldn't have been heard and (c) he wouldn't have been seen ""underneath"" the poster, working away at the wall.I find it hard to believe furthermore, that Andy would go back into the town where he proposed, just to leave money under that rock.  An escaped convict would not want to be anywhere near where people may recognize him, if he had any smarts, which Andy did.But those things alone did not prevent me from enjoying the movie, I just don't think the movie lived up to its hype, and I would feel no need to ever watch it again (and I always watch my favs over and over again!).",10
"I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.A must watch if you haven't!!!",10
"In 100 years there will be 'Casablanca.'  There will be 'Citizen Kane.' There will be '2001, A Space Oddessy.'  There will be 'The Godfather.'  And there will be 'The Shawshank Redemption.'  It is amazing that this much overlooked film has in six years reached the stature of a Hollywood legend, not only in my estimation but in the opinion of almost everyone I've spoken to about it.  This movie has gained a larger audience through word of mouth than it had the entire time it was in the theaters.  This is quite simply one of the three best movies I've ever seen.",8
"The shawshank redemption is the greatest film of all time, in my opinion. Having read great reviews for the film, i was determined to watch it myself. And that was probably the greatest film decision ever made by me. I will never forget the engrossing intensity of this masterpiece, it will stay with me and many others for years to come.It centres around a wrongly convicted prisoner Andy Dufresne and another nicknamed Red by his friends. After Red sees the wrongful imprisonment he becomes Andy's best friend and they create an unbreakable bond that is the core of the film. Years go by in Shawshank prison and the pair live with the tortures of shawshank. The neglect, the murder and the horror.But Andy changes this. He does extraordinary things for the inmates. HE befriends the guards, builds a big library and helps people with their problems. He saves them from institutionalisation.In the end an incredible series of events allows Andy to turn these factors on the prison and to get the responsible people imprisoned themselves. Andy escapes and leaves for a new life abroad. Red is released soon after and follows him. The ending sees them reunited.This is a definitive tale of how the human spirit can be denied nothing.",8
"I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!",10
"In the early '80's, Stephen King read a short story by Leo Tolstoy called God sees the truth, but waits - a man falsely accused of murder is incarcerated and over the course of decades grows to be well liked and respected by the other inmates, and eventually someone shows up at the prison who can prove his innocence. Sound familiar? King promptly ripped it off and re-packaged it as Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The main difference being that in the Russian original the dude dies in prison while waiting for his release papers to be processed whereas Stephen King had to rewrite it to give it the cheap cheesy family feel-good Disney ending that Americans have been trained to expect from everything.Darabont substitutes melodrama for an actual pulse: Like the scene where Andy crawls through a quarter-mile of Diarrhea and comes out clean on the other side, oh Lordy Hallelujah all things are possible in America! (Jazz hands). And I hate to seem like nitpicking, but if you're gonna crawl through a tightly enclosed tube in a quarter-mile of s**t, you will either pass out from the unbearable fumes and drown in diarrhea, or at the very least, have your lungs filled with fecal matter and experience some severe adverse health effects, but no, Andy is perfectly fine because that's how that scenario would totally play out. Or the ending when Red is finally released from prison - ""Oh I hope I get to see my friend again oh I hope the sea is as blue as I remember"" - And then they meet on the beach and live happily ever after because that's how prison goes -- Thug Life.The movie is indistinguishable from anything else - It does nothing new - no new techniques, story structure, presentation. It is your standard, typical, by-the-book story. There is nothing to distinguish its direction - you could've replaced Darabont with Spielberg or Zemeckis and it would've come out about the same. There is nothing to distinguish it visually - You could've replaced Roger Deakins with another big name and it would've come out more or less the same. It could've been made by any director specializing in over-sentimentality, shot by nearly anyone, produced by anyone, there are no unique or distinguishable fingerprints on it.",10
"It's always difficult to choose a favourite movie out of all the movies I have seen, but I really believe that this is the one. When I first watched it, I had not read the Stephen King novella, and had no idea what was going to happen, which made it much more enjoyable to watch. Of course, like any movie, this was not flawless, but was such a terrific emotional experience for someone who is seldom moved by cinema. This was such a cinematic triumph, and I couldn't believe that it didn't win any of its seven nominations at the Oscars. The performances were wonderful, captivating the mood of the film to sheer perfection. Nothing against Forrest Gump, but it should have been easily outclassed for Best Picture. It was also a good movie, but just nowhere near as memorable as this one.",10
"I watched it a few years ago and i dont really remember the story in details, but i remember that i had i lot of emotions here and this movie give you some life lessons.
Morgan Freeman is genius!",9
"This movie, is more than just a movie, this is about freedom and peace, between each other, many people will learn something watching it, about how the mind could be free when your body is not.great acting,great story and avery good script",5
It's just sublime. Never dates. Can not fault the film or actors chosen. A must watch for any one!,10
"Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman's performances.In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means in the top rank of movie making.",7
"Well, everyone seems to mention Forrest Gump in their bit about Shawshank.So, maybe I will, too.As a Terminator 2 fan, I feel naturally fascinated by The Shawshank Redemption. This film pushes all the buttons of a person with a caring heart.With a brilliant cast, story line, director and set, this is a master piece rivaled only by T2, Titanic, The Rock, and perhaps Dances with Wolves.A 8.5/10 from MaRX.",6
"What. A. Film.
Incredible film. One of the best in the history, i think whit Forrest Gump the bests. Morgan Freeman's performance is amazing. 10/10",10
"This movie is excellent in every way you look at it. Even the ways you don't know about it is excellent.  Every time I think about this movie it makes me want to watch it again. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a performance. A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and how they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence. (It was back in the 30's, it's probably the best justice system they had).  And how cruel the prison system was back in the day. 2nd all time favorite move. (1st being Platoon).",10
"The shawshank redemption is a must watchable movie because the storyline of this movie is brilliant and you will never feel bored a second while watching this movie, the acting done by all characters in this movie especially Red is really mind blowing.. this is a very simple, but heart touching movie, if you are a movie lover you should absolutely watch it.....",9
"Mostly what can been said has been said. This really isn't anywhere near he greatest movie ever made. For heaven's sake, it's a competent genre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of well-turned performances from the leads. Tim Robbins, incidentally, is way better in Mystic River. Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more interesting and original prison movies than this one. Cool Hand Luke is obviously the greatest prison film of all time. Shawshank is so-so. Think about it, was there a moment, a second, a single plot turn in that film you didn't know was coming? When the young guy goes out for his little conference with the warden, did you not think 'come on, guy, haven't you seen any movies?' Predictability is satisfying I suppose, in its way, but give me originality and genuine passion every time. Shawshank has neither of those attributes. Sorry to everyone who cries every time they see it. You've been had.",10
Hands down the very best movie ever made. Not much else to say.,8
"I have been waiting a long time to watch this movie and I couldn't be more pleased. The Shawshank Redemption is something like I have never seen before. The story was brilliant from beginning to end and it is definitely something that I will never forget. The acting was wonderful, the story was genius, and the whole movie was just so beautifully done. I cannot find a single flaw and therefore, I gave it a 10/10. This movie is now, perhaps, one of my favorites and I think that it is absolutely essential to watch.",10
"I'm really happy to see that this film is still on the very top of the ranks all these years, and rightfully so, I'm glad that most of us agree to it. Amongst many films, Shawshank Redemption touches our souls in the most humane way. A film of art indeed, but it serves its purpose to the fullest extent. It is a movie that touches the souls of real lives. It makes us feel human.The messages in this film are worth consideration, whilst the ending is one of most beautiful ones in cinema history. But enough has been said already, and I'd repeat most of them. As a conclusion, I'm proud to have watched this film. And it won't be the last. Rejoice for Shawshank Redemption.",10
"Run Tim Robbins's name in the database, and I don't think you'll find that he's starred in too many movies worth watching.  Generally, most movies he's in have the subtlety of a ball peen hammer across your forehead.  This movie atones for a thousand sins.  Carefully written, deliberately paced, lovingly acted, this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side. Nothing is forced, but not a single plot thread is left dangling. Hollywood needs a lot more movies like this one.  See it twice.",10
"This is not just a movie, it's a message for your life that if you utilise properly, your life changes forever for good. But you have to watch it thoroughly, with clean, sharp and receptive mind.",10
Everything touched me. I will remember this movie for the life time. This is pure masterpiece,9
"Are there people still left to watch this masterpiece? I'm talking to them, this ain't a /sci-fi/action/thriller/mystery/comedy/ movie. No CGI, No gut crunching actions. A drama yet so natural with exceptional acting moments. Just some prisoners talking to each other. Yet it is in the list of all time best. Yes, the makers might have prompted some magic spells same way like they did to the script.It couldn't win the Oscars but pretty sure it will win your hearts . The Most influential movie for me.",9
"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever",10
"I absolutely love The Shawshank Redemption. When a movie gives me goosebumps, it has done its job. Where to start. The acting in this movie is sublime. I had never seen any movie starring Tim Robbins, but Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Tim Robbins portrays an intriguing man. He and Morgan Freeman work together extremely well.The story itself is brilliant. A banker, wrongfully put in prison would not seem that interesting, but with these people and their conversations and companionship it's certainly worth a watch. I was sad when I thought the director killed off Andy Dufresne at the end, but when I realised he had actually escaped I couldn't stop smiling until the movie was over. This movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the top 250 movies, as it's a must see for everyone.",10
One of the nicest films ever and immortal in memory,3
"This is a very good film, working on a number of levels. The main theme of the film is hope in adversity. I particularly like the way that Andy becomes a kind of Christ-type. It still does not quite make my own Top Ten!",10
"** Some spoilers about the general storyline **I had some expectations regarding this movie, because of the excellent rating it got here. To start with the positive: the acting (especially by the two protagonists) is indeed of the highest level, and some scenes really grip you. The camera-work is also excellent (beautiful prison-building!)The story of this movie is a 13-in-a-dozen story about someone who (of course) is wrongly sentenced to a long story; who meets his new friend (mostly an elderly person), who makes enemies and defeats them, who turns his long-stay into something good, then is betrayed by his corrupt warden, etc. etc. Sometimes it even got a bit cheesy, the way in which all the prison cliché's were displayed.I could recommend this movie to you, if you are looking for a nice drama with good acting and good camera. Don't expect an Oscar-worthy movie, though.",6
I know it's trying to metaphor some stuff in the movie. But prisoners w/ life sentence? Excuse me? Anyone remember what they had done? THE OUGHT TO SUFFER FOR THEIR CRIME!!!!!!! (Except for Andy cuz he's innocent),10
I am not going to say anything about this movie. You just have to experience it for your self.,10
"Overall a great movie with good stuff about the movie, i really liked the movie and stuff about it and the themes and it's overall a good movie that i enjoyed.",10
"Yes, i get it. The story is very good, acting is well done, good cast ect., BUT the movie is by far not as good as so many people say. I mean its a normal movie imo...nothing too special about it. You see someone get falsely imprisoned and then he tricks the mfs working there and escapes....its a good story like i said, but cmon its nothing too special.....Maybe thats just not my genre of movies...idk...bye.",10
"It's an ""emotional manipulation for dummies"" type of film, with boring direction and cardboard characters. Nice performances by the actors though, some great moments, but nothing outside the ""Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison"" feel of the entire movie.I saw it one and a half times, and would see it again only if I got paid for the trouble.Similarly, I hated 'The Green Mile"", only later did I find out it's the work of Darabont.My recommendation: Skip this, and go see OZ again.",10
"This movie is about the prisoners. The main character is caught in the false charge. At first, he claims his innocence, but he cannot prove it. In prison, he has his own world. Also, he is so clever. He plans something and it appears 20 years later. When the ordinary people are caught in the false charge, they may give up their life, but he never gives up. He carves out his life. I think he tells me the importance of living and having the hope. There are not so many flashy exciting scene, but there is some moving scene in an important position. They give more impression to audience. There are a lot of prison film, but I like this movie the best. I think the movie should be like this.",10
"Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10",10
Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A strong man can save himself. A great man can save another.,9
"The movie was a great success. The main character was very positive in all three aspects. In despair also do not give up, and through years of efforts to escape from prison to punish the wicked. The movie's main character allows himself to bring a little hope to the dark prison.",10
"This movie is more of a drama than action, but that doesn't matter, because it would fail in either case. A viewer can accept the cliché of the wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the grain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of murdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when the statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is dangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become believable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because such men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always comes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone finding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no idea what the ""redemption"" is. Nothing makes any sense.",9
"The best movie ever made, period. I won't go on a very long and detailed review on the story(which is magnificent and perfect)I just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was perfect! I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough recognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was underestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is an art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what I'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and perfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a shame that they decided that.11 out of ten, totally deserves it.",9
I saw it a lot of times and I am ready to watch it again everytime. Great actors playing extremly fitting roles and a great story make this movie a go to movie for everyone.,6
"I figured prison life to be much harsher, as seen in other films.  This is the films only weak point, but then the story would suffer if the film was like Fight club.  This is a story about a man who loses everything but still survives.  He uses his intelligence to outwit his attackers, and function in prison.  No matter what happens he still kept his dreams alive.  What is a man without dreams?  The word institutionalized is used in this film to describe what the prison does to the individual. Tim Robbins will not have the inner freedom of who he is change to what the prison dictates.  There are many interesting subplots that keeps the viewer's attention.  These subplots culminate into a unforgettable conclusion.",10
"First time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was some two years after its release. Second time was yesterday and like every great movie it got even better this time. The movie is a beautiful story about hope that holds you above the surface even when your life seems meaningless. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are magnificent, and this film I can recommend to anyone.",3
"This is the gap, the gap in ideas, the gap in values. It is the gap between people, so there will be winners and losers in the world, there will be poor and rich, there will be this described by the storyIt is not terrible to be trapped by high walls, for some people cannot be trapped. Birds of full plumage belong to the sky, not to be caged. But if ideas are trapped by walls, people get stuck in them",10
"What can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings about this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times, emotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves around in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total mess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be lightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see what kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time, and you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's difficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you do you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their first beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown back in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also full of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a triumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I watched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no doubt for many others",10
This movie is an amazing movie. It's not comparable . Friendship is an amazing thing.,10
"This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around mystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed around emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of Morgan freeman then you should do this.",8
"The Shawshank Redemtion ReviewThe Shawshank Redemption is my favourite film for many reasons. Adapted from a Stephen King novella, the film is executed brilliantly and expertly directed by Frank Darabont. The film is sad yet uplifting and has many iconic scenes. The writing is almost perfect with all the characters being well-developed. The film keeps us informed as to the lead characters' thoughts and emotions. The score was incredible with Roger Deakins cinematography and it was beautifully portrays 19 years of life in a corrupt and brutal prison. Tim Robbins delivers an incredible performance, as does Morgan Freeman. All of the supporting cast were great from the Warden to Captin Hadley. The film's ending is perfect, moving and justice for Andy delivers the feel good factor. It's a powerful film which should have dominated the Oscars.",10
"I'm not a person that cry easily but this movie God damn, what a quality!!!.",10
This movie is absolutely spectacular and it actually does give me hope because whenever I watch it I know things will always turn out ok if bad or for worse good and hope will always come if you are hopeful and Jake the crow symbolically representing hope and that things always look bad at first but in the end you keep pushing on to survive and make it which to me symbolizes hope for me,10
"This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number 2 spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it. Trite , mawkish, shallow, unconvincing, ugly... How much more can I say about its awfulness? Morgan Freeman is tolerable, Tim Robbins is not. There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they aren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie. There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense: emotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological. Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them. Its appeal escapes me utterly. For the love of God, sink this film!",10
The best movie in history and the ending is the best ending,10
"As I was saying just amazing, it makes you laugh, cry and even shout",10
"I'd heard about this film a few years ago and I'd heard it was good. I was lied to. This film wasn't good, It was outstanding! I can't believe I never watched this sooner! From the opening scenes where the mysterious Andy Dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as Red runs across the beach to him, this film was, in a word, Perfect! No holes to spot, almost everything was completely accurate, Probably some of the best script I've ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally, If a film goes over two hours, I start to get a little bored and I end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite! I never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much, I felt as if I was there. Normally with films adapted from Stephen King books, they don't do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong! Overall, I like this film because it's realistic, it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping, you can't take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films ever!",10
"this film is very convincing hokum. nice, gentle, inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life - I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says f##k or fears bending over to pick up the soap. check out Freeman, in the token performance of his career, neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins' shaddow. what a team... so very progressive. 'hope...' . oh yeah, we've got a lot of 'hope' going on here. The lush fantasy kind, so deadly sweet and full of bull. frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet - that is no small achievement, considering... if you don't believe me check out his latest masterpiece, he just can't stop doing it. hell, why not! it sells tickets.",10
"The Godfather is very long and it's scenes are very slow, even though is an amazing movie. Also, Shawshank has a twist at the end that no one would expect.",10
"Does it get much better than this?
After 25 years of watching this, the answer is (so far), ""not really"".",10
"The review may contain spoilers!! The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that everyone will surely enjoy. The movie begins with a slow pace and as time passes you begin to love the characters and in the later part of the movie you wish it goes on and on. While watching the film, you expect a different type of ending(kind of an ordinary one). But at the end you realize that this is not an ordinary movie. The movie contains a very good message for all of us. The kind of patience and hope that Andy has is simply brilliant. Morgan has done a good job too(as usual). He has done his role as ""Red"" with complete dedication. The dialogues and background music help you to get completely involved in the movie. There are two scenes which leave you with an awe! The first one is when Andy gets out of prison by travelling through the drainage pipes and then enjoys the rain falling on him. And the second one is at the end when Red is released from the prison and Andy waits for him at a beach. My favorite dialogue is ""Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.""",10
"And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.",9
"SR is a good film. In my view it is not a great film! Firstly - it is lazy film-making to have a character (Red, in this case, played by Morgan Freeman) as a narrator to tell us what is happening. The film itself should convey the narrative. If someone has to read the narrative I might as well just buy the book!Secondly - the story is simply not believable! I can't believe that a prisoner gets to do all the tax returns for the guards and governor. I can't believe that a prisoner entering the prison just happens to have a heard another prisoner in another prison boast about committing the murder for which our hero is serving time. Thirdly - the story all ends up 'happy ever after' which is seldom the case but which, I suppose, satisfies those of a simplistic/idealistic nature. I prefer more grit and realism.Fourthly - the 'goodies' (Dufresne, Red, Brooks) and the 'baddies' (Bogs, Hadley, Norton) are drawn so simplistically they might as well have been wearing white and black hats! There is no depth of character here.Fifthly - and most damning - this film made me feel very little! I didn't really care about the characters (except - maybe - Red). The plot with Dufresne taking on his alter-ego on escape was clever and the suicide of Brooks was a bit moving but this was not enough for me. I go to the cinema to be moved by the plot or the characters; to be made to think; or simply to laugh! This was not a laughing film but neither did it reach me on any other level.It was also too long!",10
"I happened to watch this movie after taking a look at its ratings, I was like let's see what's all the hype about. After 142 minutes my jaw dropped and I said to myself ""This is the best goddamn movie I've ever seen in my life."". This movie gives meaning to life by being a legitimate feel-good movie. ""HOPE IS A GOOD THING, MAYBE THE BEST OF THINGS, AND NO GOOD THING EVER DIES."" the best dialogue ever written in any film ever produced. I was so into the film even I felt his redemption, I had a smile on my face by the end of the movie. Overall: The Best, The most satisfying, A pure feel-good film.",2
"I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.
It shows you how human nature actually is

"This classic films is one of my favourite movie of all time, and a perfect movie..well balanced by acting with a unexpected climax.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie.",10
"This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you...",10
"This is without a doubt, the best film of the 90's.  Morgan Freeman is brilliant as Red, his story is just as compelling as Andy Dufrense's.  Only repeated viewings made me realise this.  Another oscar tragedy that Forrest Gump won best picture over this, typical USA USA carry on.  This story also proves Stephen King as a wonderfull writer and not just a one-dimensional horror novelist.  So heartwarming, great humour particularly from the head prison guard and the best, most bitter sweet revenge in any film I can think of.  A no questions asked 10/10.",9
"Writer and director Frank Darabont with this work from 1994 and also with ""The Green Road"" from 1999 shows his class in screen adaptation of novels and novels by Stephen King. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman show class as number one on IMDb's viewership ratings. However, one cannot fail to notice the reviews from the critics, but that's their job, they don't read King. Despite poor commercial success (in part due to competition from films such as Forrest Gump, Crime and Speed), The Shawshank Redemption received favorable reviews (yet) from critics and enjoyed notable approval on cable television, on video and DVDs. That's why I gave it 10/10 :)",10
"I shall be short with no spoilers about the movie.This is a superb picture. Everything is right, spot on right. Beautiful acting, good camera work and a soundtrack that really helps the movie to that extra level. It is a slow, but not too slow, unraveling story with some nice twists and turns in it, all with a good ending.Do not expect much comedy and quick action, but a good story.My recommendation: 10 out of 10 points",10
"I'm sorry, I can't buy these guys as criminals, and that ruined the ""suspension of disbelief"" for me. Otherwise, an excellent story.",10
"2417th review!!!! Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever. The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because ""silence is full of unspoken words""",2
This is by far my favourite film ....I can watch it anytime and it brings out the same emotions I felt when I watched it for the first time....a film par excellence with immaculate performances....must watch !!!,6
"O.K. you've seen the summary and you're screaming ""What kind of sour limey b@!*&%$£ says that about one of the greatest films ever made?"" Well I've got news for you, look again. The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie, i agree but is it all it's cracked up to be? - no. At first you think ""I feel great - what a feel-good movie!"" One can't help wondering that this film, on closer inspection, is actually unbelievably cheesy. Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. ""But what about the great twist?"" O.k., the twist was good but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects? Also, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit? Watch Le Samurai, or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior.",10
Absolutely adore this movie. it was incredible to watch,10
"Don't miss it! Such an amazing acting, extraordinary screenplay and what not?go ahead and watch it guys.",10
"I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And for generation after generation there's only one film that I will always give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. It's powerful in every way, that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is ""a great story with great characters"".Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party who's a pro golfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy. Meeting ""the sisters "" was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety, the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each other's opinion for Andy had always been the ""hopeful dreamer"" and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy through his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.It's the best film I've seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10.",10
In my opinion the greatest film of all time. Acting - perfect. Pacing - perfect. Plot - perfect. Definitely a must watch for anyone.,3
"As a kid, this movie completely f'd with my head. I watched this at 8 years old, when it was released, and it really changed my life at the time. I experienced so many emotions that I didnt even know I was capable of experiencing at that age, and that is what a movie is supposed to do. Change your life! Challenge you. Provoke you! If youve never seen this movie, first, what planet are you from and second, watch it.",7
"In my original review, I said that I didn't hate Shawshank as much as I hated the fanbase for making it the most overrated movie ever made. On rewatching the movie, my opinion of it is lower than ever. Nevermind how Andy's escape thru the sewage pipe doesn't make much sense (during the rain storm it would've been filled with water and he wouldn't have been able to get in, assuming that in real life they even had pipes people can fit into, or how anyone could reach Mexico from New England while there's a massive manhunt for them (which is called off unrealistically quickly) despite only a few hour head-start, and how in the hell does he just walk into a bank and walk out? His picture would be circulated by then)), everything about the movie rings hollow and false; it is Hollywood escapism at its cheapest and most artificial. I felt as nonplussed by it as ever - well, that's not true - the movie is supposed to be about hope and all that typical toddler b.s., but on this viewing I found it incredibly depressing. The movie is extremely depressing when you really watch it, but everyone always focuses on the cheesy, artificial fake fantasy ending, so they forget the bleakness of the rest. It's all the more infuriating when you hear of real-life stories like Benjamin Spencer, a man who 30 years ago was falsely imprisoned and years later, even after he was proven innocent, thru a loophole, they still have him locked up to this day, which makes me even more fed up with this childish b.s. complete crap movie for the masses. Or how about all those innocent people who died in the Nazi camps? No escape for them. The more you compare this melodrama to real life, the more infuriatingly empty it is. Also, Andy's escape feels completely unearned. You don't actually get a sense of Andy's suffering (he's unrealistically nonplussed by just about everything. He feels like a cardboard stand-in). For instance, he gets sent to the hole a lot, but the movie glosses over it - he locks himself in warden's office and Morgan just gives a one line narration of how he got sent to the hole for a week, but it just instantly cuts to him joining them for lunch. The only time you see him in solitary is when warden opens the door to talk to him later on in a brief 30 second scene. That's it. It's not like Papillon where you actually spend time with Steve McQueen in the hole and you actually see him breaking down, getting lines on his face, palpable distress worsening over time. You don't get that sense with Shawshank that just glosses over all that. Also, Andy's escape feels like a cheat - warden pulls away the poster and the hole is just there, despite us never seeing Andy working on it. It's not like Escape From Alcatraz where the whole movie is planning the escape and you actually feel the tension of times when Eastwood is nearly caught working away in his cell. In Andy's cell, the hole just magically appears there, since the movie never even indicates its existence - that's not a twist, that's a cheat. Warden pulling back the poster and seeing this tunnel there is the equivalent of how in Northwest Hounded Police, the Wolf takes a pencil and literally draws a door on the wall and just walks out. I heard prisoners like this movie well enough, but I would venture that's because of the escape fantasy they can relate to, not because it's a good movie. You can show inmates a poorly acted, shot, edited, prison break-out movie and they would still probably applaud if the character escapes. What does this even add to the prison genre? It's better than most prison movies, but what does it add?",10
"Really, after all this time, why write about Shawshank now? Well, simply, it's still the best movie I've ever watched.... 10 times. This is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether it's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12). She too never moved from the couch and loved the film. This film will hold up to the test of time because it's simple: great writing, great acting, great directing and watchable over and over.",10
"Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity, they can never take your Hope.",10
There are several amazing movies that are 9 but Shawshank is the only perfect 10 that I've given because it is so rewatchable.,10
The Shaw shank redemption is a movie that you should see this movie is set in the 40s-50s and it's about a man (Tim Robbins) who goes to prison for something he did not do and along the way Tim meets another man during the film (Morgan Freeman). I think Morgan freeman is the perfect actor for this film he was just amazing and I love his voice it's so good. Anyway about the film it's about two hrs and a half long and that's a pretty long film. Through out the film Mr robbins does somethings to change the prison like one scene he makes a huge change to the library at the prison and he teaches one of the prisoners how to read and do math equations. Also he does taxes for the guards in the prison and he loses some good friends along the way and the ending was just fantastic I just loved it and the ending goes something like this: Mr robbins has just escaped and is on the beach cleaning up a boat and then he sees his mate from prison Mr freeman who was let free from prison and they both see each other on the beach and they run at each other and hug. Overall I just loved it even though the movie can be violent and sad at times i would watch this film again lots of times. Anyone that has not here is the trailer : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hB3S9bIaco. My name is Henry and if you want to see more reviews check out my page but for now goodbye.,5
"Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",10
"This movie...where to begin. Well it's hard to believe that when I sat down to watch this movie, that I was expecting a grim depressing movie, about how bad prison life could be. The main reason I watched it was because I am a Stephen King fan, and I heard this one was the best. So I sat down to watch it, and I was fully prepared to feel depressed, and also sad. And when I finished watching the movie, how did I feel...there is no way to say it other than: The exact opposite. I felt uplifted, happy, and after watching the ending, I simply said that this was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. What I liked about it so much is mainly the plot, and the characters. Andy Dusfrene, and Ellis 'Red' Redding are prisoners in the Eastern Maine Penitentiary, known as Shawshank. Andy spends over twenty years in the prison, Red even longer. And when I was watching I could feel (even though it is not shown physically) the years passing. The movie spends the first 3 quarters of the movie at the prison, and you really get to know it, and it's inhabitants, very well. The character you get to know best though is Andy. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, but there is so much more to him then that. In the twenty years he spends there he manages to earn the respect of his fellow prisoners (particularly Red), the prison guards, and the cruel warden Samuel Norton. Then one day he mysteriously disappears. Or to be exact, he escapes, the first man to ever escape from that prison. It takes him twenty years to deceive all the guards, that he is a quiet honest person, that would never try to escape. During this whole time he was planning his escape, right from the start when he asked Red if he could find him (Andy) a rock pick. It took him twenty years to do all this...hat's devotion if I've ever seen it, and that's why I loved his character. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film which take place outside the prison. The last 5 minutes though, when Red (who is also a fairly likable character) decides to reunite with the escaped Andy, it becomes very emotional, and a truly beautiful piece of cinema. So people say this is the best Stephen King adaptation of them all, but I think calling this movie a Stephen King movie, is like calling The Lord of the Rings a blockbuster trilogy, it just doesn't quite cut it.In fact I simply must say that this may just be the best movie ever made. It has an excellent plot, gritty and realistic setting, a sense of hopefulness (despite being a prison movies), extremely likable, and relatable characters and an ending that can truly touch the heart and soul of many viewers. It is absolutely 10/10",2
Everything that a good movie can have is there is this movie.,10
"This film gave me the maximal inspirations and deeply touched my inner heart as I finally knew how to cope with everything when the whole world goes against you, and the way to get over everything when the god unleash the hell on you. For me, I am now facing the greatest challenge ornament my life as I have to conquer all sorts of difficulties to successfully get the good grades in my university",9
"Why do you like this so much? It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie I've ever seen: The Great Escape, Escape from Alcatraz, Midnight Express, you name it. Because it allows the hero to be raped it's somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic. Far from it folks. The work of hacks, only the MAIN performances are redeemable. How 'bout that warden, quite a 3 dimensional character that one. As are all the peripherals. Its bad, but in an average hollywood way. Of course it's overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much. Nothing memorable, infact I'd have forgotten it totally if it weren't for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it. But hey if it does it for you more power to you. Just don't talk about it's ""power"" in front of me, I may puke.",10
"I am not a big fan of Stephen King books. Therefore, it came as a complete surprise that this compelling story was written by the ""King of Horror"" himself. Never has any other movie entertained in so many different ways. It manages to be disturbing and uplifting, both funny and moving. Morgan Freeman is top notch as usual, and Tim Robbins gives his best performance as lead character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and buy it from your local video store. You won't regret it.",10
"The difference between this story about prison in the middle of the 20th Century and any other movie is just about everything.  From the great acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to the outstanding directing, this movie just makes the viewer feel as if they spent their time doing something worthwhile.  The ending of the movie makes the movie, but without all of the other parts leading up to the finale, there would be nothing as well. Almost every scene in this has a point and a reason.  Watching others view this movie for the first time, I've noticed that the interest is usual only at an average level during the first third of the film, but as the viewer is drawn in, they soon can't take their eyes off of it.  Only the best of movies will have all of these qualities, and with it being a happy, successful story in the end, few can deny its greatness.",10
"I usually hate popular movies(pulp fiction, titanic, forest gump). So I was very sceptical when I sat down to watch the currently 4th ranked movie on the imdb. What can i say, I agree, this movie gets a 10, while some things are hard to believe(his escape) the range of this movie makes it easy to ignore. There is a lot of depth here. You get to see all the characters grow and age, you really get drawn in to the plot. It shows how brutal prison can be. And how dependent on the system one can become. Another minor thing I didn't like was how after ""The Sisters"" leader was beaten and transfered the prison seem to be a utopia except for the guards. There should have been at least a little inmate-to-inmate brutality shown.A great addition to your DVD collection.",7
"If there's one surefire movie every person can agree on, it's the shawshank redemption. while it was originally a novel, it evolved into what the IMDb considers the best movie of all time, ranking #1 in the IMDb top 250.Young man Andy Dufresne is framed and cast into Shawshank Prison, The 2nd worst prison in all of America (number one being Alcatraz) While being in the prison, he's sexually molested by insane inmates, Beat up by Heartless and immoral guards, and his experience as a banker taken advantage of by the warden. But through it all, Andy manages to keep hope through a fear that keeps all of his fellow inmates Prisoners.All i can say is, Watch this film.10/10",10
"I think if u see this movie first time, surely you will fall in love with this movie.
Excellent work... 👌",4
Six Palestinian heroes escaped from Israeli jail through tunnel today Monday 09-07They are the real heroes.,8
"This is such a good movie, that even to this day, many years after it came out, I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption. Everything in this film is timed well. The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. The acting is great, and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. It also has a very clever plot. You are not 100% sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later. Great job by everyone from director, actors to script. Just the best in movie making.",10
"""Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies."" This is the one and the only well-deserved IMDb top 1 movies on the planet.I cried so hard where Brooks hanged himself and where Red read the letter under the oak tree. One is feeling extremely sad but also later being touched by ""so was Red"" inscribed after Red's exemption. The other is feeling extremely relieved with the characters. All those struggles are worth it. Hope propped them up. Andy gave Red the Hope, which made him keep moving on, which didn't let go of Red as Brook did. A Hope, and a friendship redeemed Red. I think some day if I lose faith in my life and deem that's no way out, I 'll ask myself to watch this movie again, maybe I'll feel totally different from now, maybe it not only redeemed Red but me, but all the hopeless people. Stay hopeful, and someday we'll relieve.",10
Shawshank Redemption is one of the most iconic movies of all time. The movies premise is one of frustration. This goes all the way back to when your younger sibling told on you for something that you know you didn't do but no one believes you. Andy is that older sibling. Andy becomes such a strong character and beacon of hope in the movie because of this. Andy learns to accept his situation but never gives up on his dream. This is what makes the film near perfection. It balances acceptance with aspiration something that we all as humans seek to obtain. It is in our nature to seek equilibrium. The ending to this film I find absolutely perfect. This is exactly how this masterpiece is supposed to end. A dream which seems so impossible being achieved. This is something humanity loves to watch. It creates inspiration and Hope. I also value the imperfectness of Andy's journey. There were several instances in the film where everything could have gone tumbling down. This is how it works in life as well there needs to be luck and preparation so that success happens. I also value the adaptability of Andy's plan. It mimics the mentality that we need to adapt when our course are changed from the true north. The destination remains the same but the path is what can change. This is another aspect of the movie which make it so interesting and captivates you in it's core. Lastly gotta love a comeback story. Going from absolute rock bottom to better is a struggle and one that looks different for everyone but when completed creates diamonds.,10
"I know that other people's votes shouldn't influence mine, either way--but geez, No.2 of all time? What are the IMDb demographics that create that overblown result?I thought this was a very entertaining movie, somewhere around 8 points. But the script is kind of sugary and the characters lack the subtlety you would expect in a truly great drama. The ending reminded me of The Great Escape.There are several good performances that aren't quite able to shake loose the limitations of the script and become stirring.Cute, but not the greatest prison drama ever. I think there must be a lot of teenagers voting on IMDb.",10
The Story is too complicated Waiting to another season too maybe *Hear broken* .,10
"I myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to that sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's that 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL things.",9
"Some consider it a masterpiece, some just an example of experienced film-making. I'm sticking with the second opinion. I really do like The Shawshank Redemption, mainly because of its actors, but it remains a movie which pretends to tell a shocking story while using black-and-white schemes, unlikely characters (Andy Dufresne makes some saints look like amateurs) and incomplete character backgrounds. It is utterly unauthentic wherever you bother to question its settings or characters.A better prison movie should at least give the audience an idea of what rape, the loss of freedom, the loss of contact to your family and friends, bad conditions and dullness can really do to a person.I like the movie when it manages to show me how Brooks isn't able to adapt the outside world anymore. I find it mediocre when it tries to tell me the story of true friendship, strength and hope itself lying within a prison. I do not like it when it sells me men who manage to get through such hard times without developing any kind of trauma or negative characteristics.",10
"It is strange that this movie is 2nd in imdb chart, as it is the same old american story, where good people win, and bad guys died. More strange, the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false.",10
"Firstly, I cant belive that its been 25 years since its release. The script and direction are faultless, the cast are superb and its just a wonderful watch. I'm not going to spoil any of it but suffice to say if you havn't seen it by now, then please do, you will not be disappointed.",10
"What is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film making. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is going to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your day. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.",10
"Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A. I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters.  The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher.",7
"Awesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on the night of his crime.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three- dimensional characterizations.",6
"This is a movie to be watched over and over.  Each time I get a little bit more out of it.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together.  Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King (one of my favorite authors) novel, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", especially since it is not of the horror/sci-fi genre. I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list.",10
"About a month before The Shawshank Redemption was released in theaters, director Frank Darabont showed the film to a crowd of film students at NYU. After the screening, a student surprised Darabont by saying he was insulted by the depiction of the ""butch queer"" Sisters posse that repeatedly rapes Tim Robbins in the film. Though the student was ceremoniously shot down by the teary-eyed (mostly straight) crowd, a sensitive Darabont managed a semi-apologetic response, pointing out that he had dedicated the film to his former agent Allan Greene, who helped Darabont get the directing gig at Castle Rock Entertainment but who died of AIDS shortly before the film finished shooting. I dismissed it then, but I should have known that Shawshank Redemption would become as beloved as it is now, ranking alongside other overrated ""classics"" like Casablanca, Schindler's List, and the genuinely terrible Star Wars as one of the greatest movies of all time (on IMDb's Top 250 list, the film currently ranks #3).The appeal of the film isn't exactly inexplicable. Where Douglas Sirk and George Cukor made melodramas (""women's pictures""), and directors like Robert Aldrich and John Huston often made rock-solid noirs (""men's pictures""), Darabont does something in between, ingeniously (at least from a marketing perspective) crafting films for ""the sensitive straight man"" (you know: that strange breed of heterosexual dudes who don't have a problem telling a roomful of people they're about to ""pinch a loaf"" but are careful to leave an empty seat between themselves and male friends when they go to the movies together). Films like Twentynine Palms use the sensation of horror to plumb our country's hang-ups with sex and violence, whereas a film like Shawshank Redemption hides Big Issues behind cheap melodrama and noirish shadows. It's prison life as directed from inside a closet.Based on the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, Darabont's film follows what happens to Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) after he's sent to prison for killing his wife and lover. From the soapy courtroom theatrics that open the picture to Andy's prison escape (how's that for a dramatic overhead!) and fuzzy-wuzzy reunion with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) in Mexico, the film announces itself as Beaches for straight men. King's best stories, including his brilliant It, are bathed in the glow of adolescent innocence and sexual desire. It's an aesthetic and emotional philosophy Darabont understands and respects but erroneously applies to a story set inside a prison. Unlike the best prison dramas (like, say, Bresson's A Man Escaped, Jean Genet's Un chant d'amour, or any episode of Oz), sentimental twaddle like Shawshank Redemption (admittedly a few steps above a stinking pile of shit like The Last Castle) says zilch about life behind bars and human interaction.ADVERTISEMENTI don't mean to be cynical, but isn't prison life supposed to be a little less nostalgic than this? Shawshank Redemption is supposed to be a drama, but it's pitched somewhere between an intense thrill ride and romantic buddy comedy. When the evil Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) almost threatens to throw Andy off a roof, Darabont captures the moment with a dramatic overhead. Later, when the old man played by James Whitmore is paroled and discovers that he's lonely on the outside, he hangs himself in a halfway house. The moment would be touching if Red's trite narration didn't imply that life in prison isn't so bad after all. Freeman and Robbins are excellent performers, but just as the latter is forced to play a hollow saint, the former is nothing more than a mouthpiece for the story's trite Hallmark-isms. Red's race and social anxieties never register, and the one time he plays the role of ""angry Black man,"" he's dutifully rewarded (how's that for irony?) with a get-out-of-jail card.""Your ass belongs to me,"" says the evil warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) when Andy arrives at Shawshank. Clearly Bogs Diamond (Mark Rolston) follows the same mantra. Twenty minutes into the film, when Andy walks into the mess hall, Bogs pops up his head and looks at the fresh-faced newcomer like a vulture that's spotted fresh meat...or the love of his life. Naturally, it's only a matter time before the redheaded leader of the Sisters gang fucks Andy in the ass. Except right before Bogs gives it to Andy, Darabont's camera politely pans away. ""I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that...but prison is no fairy-tale world,"" says Red over narration. The irony here is that prison is a spit-and-polished fairy-tale for Darabont, who would rather linger on an old man feeding a worm to a sick little bird than truly confront us with the humanity of an unjust world.Darabont's version of King's story is gimmicky and schematic and panders to our most contrived sexual anxieties and base notions of revenge and guerrilla justice. By film's end, the heroic Andy has not only escaped prison, but every villain has been punished. Darabont's lead characters in Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, and The Majestic all bring to mind classic James Stewart roles from It's a Wonderful Life and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Shawshank Redemption is drenched in movie nostalgia, but the story's fixation with movies and starlets like Raquel Welch and Rita Hayworth doesn't mean anything. Just as posters in the film disguise plot twists, the film's naïve sentimentality undermines serious issues of violence, rape, manhood, and male bonding. Indeed, after the Sisters are silenced, Darabont cranks up the unilateral act of hero worship: prison goes from being ""mean and scary"" to, well, ""cute."" Andy writes letters in order to get books into the prison library, starts doing everyone's taxes, and wins the hearts of guards and prisoners alike. Someone should bake a pie. Oh, wait, they do!",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Shawshank"" as I'm sure it's said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from one hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. ""Now Andy this"" and ""Andy that"". Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries ""Shawshank this"" and ""Shawhank that"" his gospel just never lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who ""looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over"" a ""tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass"". But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!",10
"Seriously, if ever there's a film that people should be forced to watch, it's this. The acting in it is truly perfect, the storyline in very, very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest (and most misleading) endings I have ever witnessed. This film can (and will) be enjoyed by people of all ages (relatively - check parents guide for suitability), and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs.",8
"I have always loved movies in which to overcome odds, a character must think, and not just use muscle. The Shawshank Redemption is one of, if not, the best example of this!!! I LOVE IT!",10
"Well as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your hope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care about your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop, do it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. Other films that moved me like this: Forrest Gump, The curious case of Benjamin Button. IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xD",10
"Touching, moving, exceptional in every single aspect of it. Grear movie and great actors.

"'94...the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was created...to bad you movie-goers disagree. Godfather Part I is a classic, but get real you can't defy this movie.  It may get slow at points but it overcomes that with amazing cleverness and a few tricks up the director's sleeve. If you see or have seen this movie you will find or know that this movies brings out many surprises.",10
This movie has many stories to tell. Every scene has its own story. I like the way Morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. The scene where Andy gets beer for his coworkers. Also when he plays the two Italian singers on prison radio. Brooks last few days.And how Red comes to terms with his freedom. I recently watched it for the first time and can't believe how i could miss this for so long. I Also cant believe Morgan never won Oscar for this. I cant think of any better performance than this.Truly deserves the number one spot. Since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. Thank you Frank Darabont for giving us hope.,10
"This movie is good, there's no question about that, but he 2nd best ever? That's a bit of a stretch. I can't really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the 9 and 10 votes have seen very many other good movies.  Sure, the story is meaningful and it's harsh etc, but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful.  The fact that Shawshank is #2 on this list is a reflection of those voting.",6
"Believe me when I say this is the best movie I have ever seen.and I have seen anime's,movies but there is nothing like Shawshank redemption.this movie is pure gold.best movie there is and there ever will be.it stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Amazing acting by these two.wonderful story and just amazing movie.words are not enough to tell I great this movie is.its just flows with you.",10
"This movie is the best drama movie I have ever seen in my whole life, it is honestly worth watching.",5
"It is a beautiful film witha a good intention. The celebration of friendship, celebration of life are the key points. Top notch acting and direction. It is a great piece of art.",10
"This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life, your life!       Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere.",10
"Did you notice that the supporting actor (Morgan Freeman) had a lot more lines than the main actor (Tim Robins)?
this movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
it was about how hope can shape our way of living and our purposes in life.
it was about how easily we get used to our life( Brooks) how stupid little things can make our day and we almost never notice them(the scene that Andy was playing the Italian music in the office) and the most important lesson that this movie taught me was when Andy realized that he became a criminal after when he got into prison!
truly beautiful!",9
"This movie is probably my number one movie of all time. Everytime I watch it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time again. This movie shows friendship, determination, and hope (the main theme of this movie). I could go on and on about how amazing this movie is, but I encourage you to see it for yourself and the beauty of it. You won't regret, definitely buy it!",10
It gets better the original story of Sthepen King. Amazing adaptation.,10
"I would recommend this to anyone! Easy watch, although it might feel lengthy for some.",10
"What a movie! It was probably my 2nd or 3rd Hollywood movie when I started watching movies. Morgan Freeman was exceptional in his character as always though Andy Dufresne could have done better. A simple yet mesmerizing plot, wonderful cinematography and a memorable climax. This movie packs everything a cinemagoer desires. What I love most about the movie though is the message it delivers. ""HOPE"". Hope is the thing that drives us forward, Hope that we can carve a better future for ourselves than our past, than our present. Without hope, there couldn't be a meaning to existence.",7
"This movie is gold, i really liked and even more knowing is from the genious Stephen King... This movie has everything, we have mistery, suspense, drama, i really loved this film !!!",10
"One of the best films of its type, only bettered by Frank Darabont's other period prison drama based on a Stephen King story ""The Green Mile"". Mr Darabont and Mr King appear to have hit on the perfect partnership, in making fantastic films based in prisons and set in days gone by. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are both excellent in this movie, although Mr Freeman is always excellent (especially in his high school drama ""Lean on me""). Well done to all concerned in this excellent production, and let's hope that Mr Darabont and Mr King continue in this successful vein for the future",10
"This title has to be one of the greatest films ever made. It is a touching story of a man who is sent to prison for life for the accused murdering of his wife and her lover. The story is so captivating and completely differs from other prison films because of its heart.A defiant masterpiece which makes you enthralled within it from the very beginning. Brilliantly acted by Tim Robbins and, of course, Morgan Freeman as always. Brilliantly directed, scripted and the original score was very, very good.I have watched it three times in the last year and I still can't get enough of it. A defiant worth wile watch.",10
"I'll admit, I'd held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained a little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and particularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching this film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how beautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the story of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which he did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace, accepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the lasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an interesting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest to become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and, as shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman, providing both a character and the narration of said character, portrays his character in such a convincing way that one can't help but feel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an immensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant performance that I couldn't help but feel pure anger for the Warden throughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying messages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy maintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of it. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message that not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can outlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud to admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout the film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits suicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most certainly change your life. It did mine.",10
"An inspirational and warm-hearted movie that almost put me to tears at the end. This is one of those rare movies that gets better and better the more times you watch it. The great lines in this movie just made it that much better. The friendship that was portrayed by the main characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were totally convincing. It's such an involving movie that grabbed me from the start, and the great music didn't hurt either. Don't miss this powerful prison drama that  shows that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.""",9
"There are a very few movies that make you think ,think about the things that are important in life, things that truly matter and The Shawshank Redemption is surely one of those movies. It teaches you that life will put you in situations which you must not have imagined yourself to be in ever and how you can survive those situations.
You will learn something new every time you watch it.",10
"Shawshank redemption is one of the greatest classic movie ever watched by most. If you are Hollywood fan, you must watch this. Because if you skipped this, you will be missed greatest movie experience.",10
"Good cast. Good story. The performances were excellent and there was both ample food for thought, and some very good scenes. Didn't hurt that i'm a big Morgan Freeman fan. Always top notch.On the other hand, overall, the whole film was far too unpleasant, preachy, and downright repugnant, to be terribly enjoyable. When the payoff at the end finally arrived, it just wasn't grand enough to overcome the feeling i'd just crawled through the sewer.And for this to be the #1 film on IMDb (actually second, but same score as #1 and with more votes) among far superior films like ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Casablanca"", is ludicrous. This would never even have entered the remotest regions of my mind if somebody had asked me to name some really great films.",10
This is the best emotional roller coaster you could ever watch,10
"What I can say is this is a really great movie. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. You will succeed in the end. And also be ready at any time.Maybe it is because of language problem, I don't grasp it very well in the beginning. But step by step, I understand it. And in the end, I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesn't happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past. And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are good actors. And this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic, but still give people good feelings.Great movie encourage you while entertaining you!",1
"This movie was incredibly unrealistic, I hate how the father lied to his son. it was ridiculous and the son was stupid for believing him. the fact that the father turns into a fish at the end is highly problematic. 2/10",10
The movie had plot up the wazoo! The acting was superb. Robbins and Freeman were at their highest in this movie.  There were so many emotions flying through it and there was so much about the human mind.  It will leave you in awe.,10
"I just visited a prison museum in north China, which was a real prison used in early 1900s.  This movie reminds me of horrible dark room, sodomy, and brutal corporal punishment that actually can happen to you in the jail.Whether you are innocent or not, once you are IN the jail. You are all the same. Your are finished. But, Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is not. With hope and his persistence, he escaped from jail after 20 years. Imagine to dig a big cement hole with the small stone hatchet! Amazing.Where there is a will, there is a way. This movie is encouraging.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a masterwork and an unforgettable movie which can touch the soul. The movie contains deep and priceless concepts such as hope, dream, friendship, hardship and patience.It is a movie about an educated banker named Andy who is accused and prisoned for murdering his wife and her lover and despite his claim of innocence, sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank prison. It is narrated by a prisoner called Red who becomes Andy's best friend.The film is based on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King and starring Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyed Reddis who is a prison contraband smuggler.The Shawshank Redemption is not a depressive movie; conversely there is a lot of humor and life in it and also, warmth and loyalty in the friendship. I believe that the movie is neither a prison drama nor about violence and crime. It has a great foundation and presents profound impressions like hope which is totally adorable and also, freedom and trying really hard to achieve it.The actors presented great performances and Robbins was wonderful in his role. He could perform quite well as an intelligent, inspiring and a positive man. Also, Morgan was completely believable in his role as a criminal who spent most of his life in the prison and is in deep regret of the crime he committed.In fact, I had watched the movie before, but when I watched it again, I was stunned by how much better it is on repeated viewings. I believe what makes this film one of the best one ever made, is the messages it conveys.",10
The Shawshank has one of the greatest messages of all time. Hope. Hope is the idea of believing in yourself or others. It helps you get motivated and helps you persevere. You see Andy dufrine getting wrongly accused and going to prison there he meets his mates and learns each and every one of them he studies the people the ward. at the end a miracle happens I'll try not spoil it. Overall I've seening this movie as a 13 year old really helps your mind. Too many teenagers are being depressed every single day. I want to tell them hey see this movie it will help you. Oh well no one likes my movie taste.,10
"In my opinion, this is the greatest movie of all time. Everything down to the smallest details make this movie mind-blowing. Frank Darabont did a fantastic job adapting the novella by Stephen King. Many movies use narration as a crutch due to bad storytelling but in this movie it's just amazing. Morgan Freeman did an extraordinary job as Red, and Tim Robbins was just as great as Andy Dusfrene. You can watch this movie again and again and again without getting bored. Like some 3 hour movies, this movie does not drag at all. Just do yourself a favor, and watch this movie. It's more than worth it.",10
"This is a good movie but it is far from being the best movie I have ever seen. The plot is ok but with many plot holes that I don't find really convincing. What do I mean by that? Well, the way that Andy dig the tunnel from his prison cell for years and that nobody noticed because it was behind a simple pretty girl poster.This movie is probably among the first movies about life in prison like this but these scenes are now so cliche (prison rape, creepy guy approach in shower, corrupt officers, etc.) and to me they are so predictable. I like movies to be unpredictable but with this one I guessed everything that was about to happen.It's just so unconvincing that he is able to run like that and to even be accompanied by Red later (like no one would follow Red to see if he takes them to Andy).",7
It's really amazing movie but it doesnt deserve to be on the top of the list,10
This movie is the greatest movie ever made and has the greatest actors ever Iike Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and this movie has everything it has friendship hope sadness and a twist ending whoever says they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again.,10
"Seeing Shawshank as the IMDb #1 did not surprise me a bit. This movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come.I like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. There is no glossing over the painful stuff. He was innocent but still jailed. He did get raped. His chance DID get wiped out to have his story confirmed. What a waste.I read some people calling this a 'feel-good' story. Perhaps in the end, but other than the relief of freedom, there wasn't much to feel good about. Talk about a hard-fought battle. And it isn't even over... His life is better than it was, but still sucks considering everything he lost, considering he can never go back, considering he is always a fugitive...If you're feeling bummed out about your own life, this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse.",10
"I cant believe that something so simply good exists. This is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my TV. I loved every piece of it and i'm gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. I can't describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it, because i can't find the right words to describe it. Watch it and you will see what i mean. The first time is always the best. It's the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. And after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece. What i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays. All those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it.",10
"After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i am doubtful if this will ever happen.",8
"I am so pleased to see the high rating this movie has received. Many people I know have never heard of it, but when I tell them about it and they rent it, they are 'converted'!! Compared to so many recent movies that are eye-candy, this film delivers the true meaning of friendship and focuses on this aspect instead of flasy cars, lasers, dumb plots and high paid actors bloated with self confidence.Another movie along the same line is ""Spitfire Grill"". Rent it and you will probably enjoy it as much.",7
I really like this movie.  It was very well done and the screen play was great.  Totally awesome plot and the best acting I have ever saw.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It was a movie to die for.  You could tell that they put time and efffort into making this masterpiece.,7
"""I have been thinking for a while to watch "" Shawshank Redemption""(1993) the number one movie on IMDb list 9.2/10,finally did it, its a excellent example of good story telling ,one of the story that makes u think and touches your soul, this movie is all about hope ,hope in bad times & not letting it go whatever is the situation ,hope that one day u will have your laugh,hope to be loved again,hope to achieve something big,hope to breath free. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)not only was hopeful for himself in the his bad time but made his prison mates hopeful by providing them feel of freedom through books and music,he also gave his best prison mate Red (Morgan Freeman) reason to live once he made it out from the prison. and as Tim Robbins says ""hope is one of the good things and good things never dies"".",10
"Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented on-screen. The director does an excellent job of showing the bleakness of prison life, the frustration of a life gone awry, and the misery of losing all one holds dear in life, while somehow preserving the hope of better things to come. Every actor was perfectly cast and the story-line draws to a perfect and satisfying close. If you enjoyed the film, you'll love the book from whence it came; ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"".",3
"The best movie ever made. Perfect acting, direction, script, music etc. It was seriously robbed at the Oscars in the worse Academy Award mistake of recent years.There is no film better. That's all there is to say.",9
"After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating. The movie is nice, even good, but no way it should receive a 9.0.The movie could easily have been produced by Disney: strong moral & a happy ending. Sure, there are strong points. The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins' performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind. 3 out of 5. That's all there is to it.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. Andy Defrain escapes from prison by digging a hole in the wall that is hidden under the poster of the model. Warden and Brookes commit suicide and Baron gets sent to jail. Lastly, morgan freemans character is set free.",7
Worth every minute of it! I didn't expect much from it but Freeman's narration got me hooked quick. The portrayal of friendship is on another level..then it finishes with a powerful punch!,6
"No matter what it is, hope cannot be closed. Everything is caused by hope. Is it because of the inner hope that countless hard work, hard work, and unrelenting returns? With hope, Shawshank Prison is nothing but a hope. With a hope, a small hammer can redeem life, redeem freedom, and even Shark Castle (Shawshank Prison).",10
The first time I watched this movie I was immersed in a prison world where survival is on the daily schedule and hope means everything. I was literally breathless for 2 hours. I just cannot believe how this movie was so undervalued when initially released. This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen. This is one movie where the ending does not really matter. It is the journey that will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will wish it never ends.,7
Just watch it....one of the finest movie ever made.,8
"This film ranks second among my all time favourites. The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Python's ""The Holy Grail"". Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film, with one of the best endings I have ever seen; even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman, who should have won an Oscar for his voice-overs alone. In a word, Exceptional.",10
"Don't get me wrong - I liked this movie just fine, I just don't understand how it deserves the *heaps* of rapturous praise it regularly receives from IMDb members, and the fact that is has been ranked at #2 in the hallowed IMDb Top 250 for the past 8 years or so just baffles me. It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as a good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I realize I am way in the minority on this, however.",2
I really loved this movie I watch 2 time actually but it was too long,10
We watch this when its on tv but i notice where they take out certain words so if you see it watch it on dvd! This is one of those movies that make you feel like you live with the characters and that's why the end is so redeeming to watch.,10
"I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course.  The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language, powerful and powerless speech, posture, intimate and social distances, territory, chronemics, various types of listening, and self disclosure.  Many ""young"" students struggle to relate ""in-class/in-text"" examples to their own lives, and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication.  ALWAYS a good experience for my students!",8
Don't even bother reading any reviews this movie needs no introduction. Watch it and then regret it because no movie will EVER come close to how exquisite shawshank is. Please show this to the next generation when appropriate as its truly groundbreaking. (Or should I say wall...),9
"This movie is the perfect balance of class, beautiful directing and feel-good ending.",9
Prisión LIFE and thugs! Join Shawshank in this adventure!But B Warned it's not Comedy or Action!,1
"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? The storytelling, music, visuals, characters, emotions, themes, literally everything has been carefully thought out and done exceptionally well.My only problems with it - Tommy just happens to know the guy who killed Andy's wife and that guy just happens confess everything to Tommy.The fact that literally know one, not even the guards during Inspection bothered to flip a poster even once for 17 whole years.Aside from these things, everything else is perfect.",10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were splendid in this look at the horrors of prison life. Great camera work, acting, and a believable script led to a realistic feeling movie. This is only the second King book that made a good film; ""The Stand"" being the other.",10
"At first I wanted to give this movie a 9/10 but then I though what could have been done better and just realised there wasn't much you could have done ""better"" without ruining your film. This movie has 2 fundamentally diffrent goals. The first one is to entertain you by letting you follow the story of 2 friends that either are let out on parole or escape prision. For this part I would have given it an 8 because it has a long a consistent build up with clues thrown all over the movie that you just don't realise (or as the movie put ""when was the last time you looked at someone's shoes"") but over all it lacks in suspense especially during the mid section of the film. But there is a diffrent more important goal in this work of art. It is to show the viewer the diffrent aspects of unjustice that occurs in prisions all over America. The sexual violence between inmates, the bribes to guards, the unchecked violence by guards against inmates, the lack of humane treatment, the problems of unpaid prision labour both for the inmates and the local economy, the underfundung of non guarding aspects of prision life, the unjust of parole committee, the lack of rehabilition work and the payoffs the prision officals accept by letting them follow one person through their whole time in prision. This really is what makes this a movie which isn't just worthwhile but great and rememberable and therefor deserving of a 10/10.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. Arguably the best movie of all time. A thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow, this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True masterpiece. There won't be another movie that can be quite anything like this.This movie is so powerful that I can't even describe this in a few words. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away, but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that ""Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies"".",10
"Why Shawshank Redemption isn't rated 9.9/10 is beyond me.What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube, it's all about stories.Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like when Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives Red the harmonica, it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. It's a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable, over and over again.I am convinced that's why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly, it's the small things that touch you. How many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...it's the most powerful of goals we can have, hope really sets you free.",10
Really this film is simply a string of cliches and is mediocre in every way.,10
"Plot: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker, convicted of a murder he did not commit and sent to Shawshank prison. After two months of being there, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) 'a man who knows how to get things'. The warden (Bob Gunton) uses Andy's banking skills for his scams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. Andy spends twenty years in prison before his legendary escape.This is said to be the best film ever made. I can see why. It is defiantly my favourite film of all time. Some say it is too over rated and that might be true but there's no doubt it is a fantastic and well executed film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator. William Sadler is also good. You can't help but laugh with Haywood.The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of, hope, friendship and obviously redemption. It also has a way of connecting with the viewer's experiences. People relate their own life to the film and it helps people deal with bad moments it their lives. This is not a film to miss.",10
"It's just perfect movie.Subject, details, and engagement.Describes the struggle of a human being a character who confronts injustice.",4
"Sure it was a good prison movie, and much better than many other movies I've seen.  But this does NOT beat Godfather, Star Wars, or Casablanca in any way.  Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot, but don't expect a present-day classic ala Forrest Gump.",10
"Trust me this one of the movie that u must be watched before dead. I really love the story. Thanks for stephen king!!! Good acting too. Everything about this movie so good. In fact from me this rating movie should be 9,8 :)",10
Okay based on what is the greatest movie of all time. It didn't win best picture that year. None of the actors won an Oscar! Besides I have never seen a human who doesn't get old over so many years. I am sorry but I think bragging about this movie ruined its beauty.Defiantly not a top 10 movie of all time.,10
"I won't repeat the ravings by others about this Movie (yes, that's a capitalized M!) I'll just share with you my experience watching it on CNN last month. I'm a graduate student, and midterm week was approaching. I constantly said to myself: Ok, I'll go to the library at the next commercial break ... but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the first 5 minutes... and by and by I forgot I was watching a film. Finally when it was over I was left tearful and speechless. It was that powerful an experience. I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching the film. Those 3 hours are worth every second of it, I can tell you that!",5
1994 - year for the classics. The best movie ever.,2
"Keeping this short and sweet, meek Tim Robbins is a convicted accountant who is sent to a real MEAN prison in Maine. The captain of the corrections officers, the massive-jawed Clancy Brown, is quick with his baton, agitato, so to speak. The warden, Bob Gunton, is a corrupt dictator. Morgan Freeman, serving a life sentence, becomes a friend of Robbins. Robbins has a lot in the upper story and goes about doing good for the penitentiary and for the inmates, despite the beatings, attempted rapes, and unjust punishment. Under his management the library becomes a beacon for all prison libraries. Many brutal years pass before Robbins, an amateur geologist, tunnels through the prison wall, hauling a bundle of ill-gotten pelf, crawls into a five-hundred yard long sewer pipe filled with excreta, and splashes through a river to freedom and a tiny coastal village in Mexico, Zijuataneco. I drove there about the time this escape takes place and it really WAS a cheap, peaceful, fishing town with an irregular water supply. Now it's a metropolis. After forty years of imprisonment, Freeman is finally paroled. He joins his friend Robbins in Mexico, where they pursue an honest living as simple fishermen and become lovers for life. (Kidding.) It's a long movie but a gripping one. Movies about prisons are difficult to make. The surroundings are hardly epic, the wardrobe drab, the inmates participate in what the sociologist Erving Goffman called ""the small rewards"" system common to all total institutions -- gifts and trades of items like cigarettes and harmonicas. The inmates have humble jobs, nothing exciting about working in a laundry. No women. Threats and occasional fist fights but no open warfare. And here there's not even the suspense of watching men prepare for an escape. How do you fold these conditions together and come up with a story? The people who produced ""The Shawshank Redemption"" have managed to pull it off, and without directorial display -- no fireworks, no instant cutting, no screechy metallic noise on the sound track, no razzle dazzle whatever, just classic movie making. The success of the film is helped ENORMOUSLY by Morgan Freeman's performance as the friend of Robbins. He's an exceptional actor, and though we may see him now mostly in the role of mentor, his early performances as a heavy shouldn't be ignored. God, he was one charming and terrifying pimp in ""Street Smart."" Robbins does a good job too, although his role requires him to be subdued. It also requires him to be saintly, alas. There's nothing wrong with him. He's a genius, doing everybody's tax returns. He's more sinned against than sinning. Cool Hand Luke at least was reckless and expedient and brought the storm down upon himself. And Luke's guards would have made mincemeat out of Robbins. Robbins' prison is a kind of fantasy land in which he can at will commandeer an office, lock the doors, and play a record of an opera over all the loudspeakers. It's also a pipe dream to believe that all of the inmates would stop what they're doing and stare in wonder at the loudspeakers broadcasting two ladies singing in Italian. Slim Whitman, maybe. But Joan Sutherland? They would have booed. Nor would inmates show the kind of solidarity on display here, once Robbins pulls them together. The coolest presentation of self in an institution like this is utter indifference, except for some offense against the honor of one's self or one's gang. It's a cold-hearted place in which practically nobody applauds when someone else succeeds.However, put all the fantasy aside and accept it for what it is, a fictional tale of men who pay dearly for misdeeds and ultimately save themselves and undermine the foundation of corrupt society. Not heroically, just by sheer persistence.",9
The shawshank redemption is the great show to illustrate hoe people according to their ancestry can be enslaved free or conversely in freedom captive shawshank redemption is a great show to depict.,10
"One of the most creative and satisfying cinematic endings.  I don't know anyone who was not touched by this movie.The story of two men, Andy Dufresne and Red, takes place inside the confined prison walls.  Their growing friendship develops into a close bond.
With the desparation of prison life, the story takes a turn for the better at the end.",10
"The only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in IMDB but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1...I only saw Shawshank Redemption once, and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since. It was ok to see it once even though I was almost bored then, but not quite. I found it very average in every respect, and quite predictable. I guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions, thoughts or memories, and does not have any obviously bad technical quality. Just sooo average. Hence the high score?",8
This is the kind of bad  that I'll still watch after 30 years.,8
"""Get busy living, or you'll get busy dying"" not everyone gets this line. A movie that makes you realize about the value of freedom and the value of life. The director, Frank Darabont did an amazing job with his narration. The kind of satisfaction one feels after watching this film and every time one thinks of this film is something that can't be expressed in words. Really one of the greatest movies I ever watched. I highly recommend everyone to watch this to feel the emotional connection it establishes instead of spending time reading the reviews and get to know the plot in the form of spoilers. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman delivered their career-best performances in my view.",10
"Shawshank is on TNT approximately five million times a year. It is the second-highest rated film on IMDb, and it was nominated for seven Oscars. It is a movie that can make grown men cry. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score is beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship, will power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather, Godfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is it really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a ""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and is willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in cold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose him and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and just kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the beach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and plays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the prisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder. Are you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in the film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the 1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving it all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and Red ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder about, no ambiguity — everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty, happy-ending bites, right up to the final ""hug on the beach"" scene. Wait this movie ends with happy people hugging on a beach? Yes it does.",10
"This, for me, is film at it's best. The acting, (Tim Robbins, in particular, is amazing. Morgan Freeman is his usual wonderful self also.) the screenplay, the production, the...well, all of it! I could rave about it until I'm blue in the face, but I'll spare you (and myself) that. I must have watched it over a dozen times now, and with every viewing I still get as caught up in it as I did the first time I saw it. For me, that's one of the marks of a special film. I'm don't really want to use the term 'uplifting' yet again, but it is the best way to describe it. Highly recommended.",10
Bill's and Morgan's brilliant performances coupled with an immersive scenario and production makes this movie one of the all time legends.,6
The story line is beautiful and the casting expertly done. It one of those movies that you take so much from it that you get to criticize or judge other movies quality and casting based on movies like this one.,10
"Easily the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen it a lot.However there is not much that can be said about the film that has not already been said. Even though I have seen it more than 100 times and once saw it 4 times in one day the best thing I can leave you with is simply this:Some extremely good movies are not only famous for there stories and acting but also their soundtracks. Inception would be a great example of this. Shawshank however is so extremely brilliant and captivating that you barely realise that the soundtrack itself is one of the best ever made. Seriously have a listen to the soundtrack on spotify and rewatch the movie. For me it elevated the movie to new heights, which should not have been possible.",10
"Movies which are better than their source novella!Imagine that!I admit I went and read the story after the first or second time I watched this movie, but I enjoyed it regardless. This film is a movie of hope and friendship and remaining alive even if the tunnel seems never-ending.Well done all around.",10
"While most films of its caliber choose to depict a tragedy, Shawshank opts for a hopeful ending. However, what makes it so great is the fact that it never shies away from the horrors of its central setting, particularly the institutionalization of the prison, making it all the more rewarding when the story's protagonists manage to find a way out. The performances are layered and compelling. The story is packed with numerous symbols and moments of foreshadowing. Though The Shawshank Redemption is not necessarily a groundbreaking film, it is by far the best example of telling a simple, heartwarming story with deep sensitivity and attention to detail.",10
"Very few movies that made me cry ... and (The Shawshank Redemption) is certainly one of them. I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship.Very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance. It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved, but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all time based on people's votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation.If you did not watch this movie yet, then you missed a lot!",10
"This is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. I am a Morgan Freeman fan and apart from Driving Miss Daisy, i have loved all his movies that i have seen. The Shawshank Redemption stands above all. I think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. The only other prison movie i like as much is the classic Clint Eastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. The Shawshank Redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the DVD, i still watch when it is on TV. 15 years since its release and i still haven't seen anything i like more. I would recommend this movie to everyone and if you haven't seen it yet, you must be living in a cave or something. If you are in a cave, get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10",10
"There is no reason for this movie to be above Citizen Kane, Godfather 2, etc.  It is a good enjoyable movie yes.  But it is also cheesy at times and a little bit pretentious. I believe what works for this movie is that it has a sort of ""everyman"" charm to it. It is a movie that an entire family can sit and watch and enjoy.  Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know movies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not very strong.  The performances are solid, but I believe I have seen Morgan Freeman do this role better many times before.  Is this a better prison movie than say... ""Murder in the First""? Probably, but is it sooo much better that this film deserves to be number 2 all time.  THink about that... the second best film EVER. Somehow I doubt that.",10
"Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to ""give him a handshake"". And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again.",10
"I've seen this film many times before , and every time I watch it it just seems to get better! There really is nothing bad I have to say about this film , because the overlying message of the film is infinite , and it's just such a timeless classic . I can't imagine the movie without Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them , because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. While there are some scenes that truly stand out to me , you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. It's one of the best of all time and I can promise you that you will enjoy it !",10
"The entire movie isn't about how the protagonist of the story pays back the officials for stealing his life but it is also about patience, making a life where you live and helping people as you go. This movie celebrates friendship and reaffirms the fact that the friendships born at the most adverse situations are the ones that lasts the most. Every character is unique. From the guy who has spent the better part of his life behind bars and is unable to adjust to a different society to the guy who holds out till the end, every single character is fully developed. The rare scenery and lighting actually helps you feel like you are living the moment in the beer crate scene. You realize the freedom. You find that the little kind act has provided solace to all the prisoners. We are left to wonder if correctional institutions are actually serving the purpose they are meant to do as well as look at the dark side of law and politics where an innocent is captured and jailed.",10
"Acted out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of Frank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of Shawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first time I ever saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I knew nothing about it, and was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten minutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the screen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about pausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying my eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman out-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim Robbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been regarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever emerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A story of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope. More even, than all of that, ""Shawshank"" is a story of humanity, and one that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long time.",7
"Not for a reason. But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. Its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. A film who reminds more than presents. Values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. Short - a film who must see!",10
"Based on the King short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', this Frank Darabont masterpiece has etched itself in the minds of viewers ever since its release as one of the most beloved films of all time. In the beginning of the short story, its alternative title is revealed to us: 'Hope Springs Eternal'. This in essence is the message that the film is trying to convey to the audience, and what a wonderful way it is revealed!",10
"When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free. And "" don't never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die "" this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :)",10
"Thank you Tim Robbins, you are the only reason I could sit through this long winded tale of garbage. As far as prison movies go, this suffers from an identity crisis is. Tries to do too much by not actually doing anything at all story wise. Watch Cool Hand Luke instead",6
"this film is simply brilliant. the characters are all totally awesome and so are the actors who play them! also when watching this amazing film, you don't think to pick up on the little things until it all becomes clear! it truly is one of the best films that i have ever seen along side requiem for a dream and the lord of the rings trilogy. it is that good that when watching it, you forget that it is a film because you get so into the story and so in love with all of the characters. the men/women who wrote the script for this outstanding movie sensation is exceeding talented, as are all of the people involved in this production and they should all be proud of themselves for producing one of the top three greatest films of all time.",10
"I just don't know how can it be possible to rate this movie like 10/10. Boring, very predictable storyline, some set up and pay off very obvious, so many sub plot unnecessary and at the first 10 minutes is very obvious that is going to escape but in the 2 hours after they decided to deviate the spectator attention with other stupid stuff but ok. Certainly not cinema this stuff but ugly entertainment.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have seen in sometime. The first time I saw it was in my Film & Literature class and I loved it from start to finish. It keeps you thinking and even if you read the novella, there is changes to it. There are many foreshadowing in it that could help you figure out what's happening later in the story and overall. Many film fans should check it out and even later buy it if you want. The film also has many likable characters as well and you'll have some of those funny moments (but not a lot). It's a movie that you'll watch again and again.Stars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Mark Rolston. Year: 1994",10
"What can i say, its shaw shank. I don't refer the film as the shaw shank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what I'm on about when i say its my favourite (and i only seen it in April 2012). The story is well known as Andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double murder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red (played by the awesome Morgan freeman). Over time in the movie he adapts to life in prison and escapes and becomes a free man. How did a movie this so simple become beloved by so many. How? I don't know how and i don't care but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and already became a success years later. Although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well, years later people discovered it on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it, it is more than just good. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films (except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot). I didn't cry at the end, i smiled at the end. What a film.The good of the film, the acting from freeman. Although he lost to hanks in Forrest gump for best actor, i don;t care as hanks did as much as a good job as freeman did (if better). Tim Robbins was also amazing and likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest level. The score is beautiful, the mies en scene, the scripting writing is gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and it is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect and the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy raising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be attempted when finishing school (as i have did).A film highly recommend by me and others as well, touched me to the point of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will live as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5",9
"After reading all the rave reviews for this movie, it turned out to be a real disappointment.  Can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all ""crooks""??  Haven't we overdone the hypocritical ""Bible thumper""?? -- let's find a more enlightened characterization.  James Bond, himself, could not have followed the main character's escape plan.  The ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from ""Cool Hand Luke"".  Enough!!!  Unfortunately, fine performances by both Robbins and Freeman were wasted in this ""fantasy"" story.",10
"In these times, where an ""Every man for himself"" mentality prevails and one's self worth is measured by possessions, this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have, as this country spirals out of control, is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend.As time passes and, more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social, political and economic disaster, this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. Perhaps, one day, we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and, a major theme of this movie, lies in our relationships with others. Until then, we will have the Shawshank Redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like.",9
"This movie captures many of things that made us love movies in the first place! It is a movie that contains many beautiful messages about life in general and how we should always be grateful for what we have, it's about friendship, it's about dedication and determination! It teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. I rated this movie 10/10 because I seriously couldn't find any flaw, the direction, script, acting, production values, and acting. What I like about this movie is that's all about humans, it's about the simple human needs that we seek, freedom, love, respect, power, friendship, health, fairness and justice. This movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference, it will touch you so deep!",10
This is the worlds best movie. Never seen any other beautifull movie than this one. Best acting and story. Must watch movie,5
"This has got to be one of the greatest films of all time! Absolutely flawless! The acting, the story line, the scenery is amazing. Amazing directing. Just a superb production. Sorry if I'm extra with the praises but this movie will not waste your time. I saw it several years ago and can still watch it til this day and be entertained. First review on IMDb.",10
"I really can't explain why this movie does absolutely nothing for me.  It has a great cast that turns in some good performances, and the story is compelling; however, I always feel so empty after I see it.  I get a similar vibe from FORREST GUMP and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, to name a couple others. I can't really figure out why.",10
"This film is hard, exciting, realistic, beautiful and surprising. The Shawshank Redemption completely absorbs you and constantly throws you back and forth between joy and sadness. It simply blew me away, and if it was possible, I would give it 11 without thinking twice.",10
"From the writing, direction, camera, and actors.... this is one of those films that seems almost like you have to watch it over and over. It reminds you never to give up, to figure a way out of your situation, to be patient.... the list truly goes on. Thank you for such an incredible film!",10
"This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my seventeen years.  The movie is highly underrated by film critics, but if you look at imdb's top 250 films you will see it is rated #1.  Tim Robbins gives his best performance, he plays a prisoner who is serving time for a crime he didn't commit.  I guarantee you, you will enjoy this movie.  Check out my other reviews!",10
"How many ways can I list why this is best movie of all time?1.  The most perfect ending of any movie I've ever seen. 2.  Best story - Steven King (not even a fan of his) 3.  Best acting performance: Morgan Freeman, absolutelyamazing, best ever (Tim Robbins is brilliant also) 4.  Best narration - Morgan Freeman's character 5.  Most uplifting, touching, moving story ever told. 6.  Outstanding soundtrack 7.  Beautiful cinematography. 8.  Most evil antagonist - The warden 9. Best dialogue - so many memorable phrases and quotes!I could keep going.  I've never encountered a movie that has touched so many people.",10
Good very good its a good and i aconselho a ver fdsafsadfdsafdsaf,10
"A film which has every emotion packed in. Tim Robbins is fantastic. Morgan freeman is the typical Morgan Freeman, amazing actor who is in my eyes an all time great which we will not see the likes of again.Mark Rolston(Alien, Rush Hour, Lethal weapon) and Bob Gumpton(Patch Adams, Broken Arrow, Ace Ventura) play the bad guys you hate to love.The Shawshank redemption is a film that can be shown in cinemas till the end of time and will sell every showing.",10
"Ten Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story, incredible cast. I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films. There should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out ""Million Dollar Baby"" for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasn't all there when ""Shawshank"" deserved its due. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. Yes, this one is one to own, if you don't have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed.",10
"The title says it all. ""Hope is a good thing probably best of all & good thing never dies ."" it shows the actual truth what humanity always need most .",3
Fresh movie. Very good. I do be liking Morgan Freeman and Andy Dufreshne.,10
"For the life of me, I can't understand all the gushing about this cornball, sentimental and PHONY movie.  There are certainly some strong performances, but they're outweighed by some of the two-dimensional portrayals, weak writing (that opera sequence -- oh, please) and most of all a completely garbage ending (I won't give it away) that stomps on what little credibility the movie has.I guess you really can't go broke under-estimating people's intelligence.",10
I think that says what I think about the movie pretty clear.,10
This was a very good movie.  Robbins and Freeman are Terrific.  It was a very moving movie.  I would strongly recommend this movie.,10
"I cant understand why this movie got such a high rating. its a good movie but there are lots of others that deserve to be number 2 in the ""best of all time list"" (american beauty, pulp fiction, Chaplin's, Buñuel's or Kubrick's movies, just to name a few). Well..I'm an old Stephen King fan and the story of ""Redemtion"" is good and thrilling and the acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that has'nt been made before. don't get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a well made entertaining picture and nothing more.So watch it and have a good time but don't expect an artistically great work or something all too original.",1
One of the finest movies that I have ever seen. It's a must watch.,10
"These two did an amazing job together. You don't see this type of story telling between two actors in modern-day movies, let alone an amazing story at this level.",10
"As of March 2012, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty on the ""IMDB Top 250"" list with 731,886 ratings averaging at about 9.2/10. That's astounding. On Rotten Tomatoes, a site much more critical where it is a rarity that new movies possess a ""fresh"" rating, the film has merited a 90%. Another commendable achievement. I bring these two facts up because I'm just amazed at how high the film is ranked. Here's a film that holds the ""IMDB Top 250"" list by a long shot, yet doesn't immediately come to people's mind when thinking ""the best movie of all time."" Of course, being on the ""IMDB Top 250"" doesn't qualify as an official listing. Being featured on AFI's list is more respectable, but still, it is subjective. Just a bit more broader and stronger, since a group of high intellectuals choose the films. If one looks further down the ""Top 250"" list, you'll see a number of questionable entries such as The Dark Knight, Inception, and Toy Story 3. Their presence doesn't necessarily mean they're the best - just the highest rated by people.But I have no quibbles about Shawshank's placing on the list; it is a wonderful, wholesome parable about redemption and reassurance of one's self worth while locked inside a penitentiary. We are met with characters who are trying to escape the confines of a monotonous lifestyle in prison, bot mentally and physically, and find a rare amount of comfort when with each other. The film is adapted from Stephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption - a novella that isn't so much physical suspense and horror as it is psychological horror; a different route for King, an author who has focused so much on the supernatural and the victimized outcasts in his long career.We are placed in Shawshank State Penitentiary, located in Maine in 1947, where Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is convicted of murdering his cheating wife and her lover and is given two life sentences. Andy assures he is innocent, but circumstances prove differently. He meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Freeman), a man too serving life, who acts as a con man who can get you anything you want as long as you give him his asking price plus 20%. At first, Red doesn't think too much of Andy, betting ten cigarettes with his buddies that he'll cry the first night in prison.Andy doesn't cry. He seems rather content, despite the treatment and hell he has been through. As time passes, by time I mean years and eventually decades, Andy's relationship with Red grows. They become understanding of each others positions, and Red takes a rare liking to the man. So do many other prisoners. At first, Andy is a victim of mistreatment and abuse from his villainous and heartless prisoners, but he eventually keeps his head held high, and works out deals with Warden Samuel Norton, who is played by Bob Gutton in a scarcely recognized performance that is equal parts frightening and breathtaking, to do odd-jobs around the prison to earn money, but more importantly, respect.Not only do the prisoners become smitten with him, but the guards, policemen, and suits alike. They admire his persistency. There comes a time where Andy desperately wants more funding for Shawshank, not just for bars, guards, and walls, but for books and to assimilate growth for the feeble and decrepit library currently in the prison. The guard tells him that he can write as many letters as he wants but the state government won't pay any mind. So, Andy patiently writes one letter every week to try and convince them why extra funding is vital.Here's where the spoiler comes in. The film's main morals are optimism, self worth, and hope. The film's tagline perfectly spells out its identity; ""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free."" There is a character in the film named Brooks (Whitmore), who is the prison trustee. Upon being released from the penitentiary, Brooks commits suicide by hanging himself. The reason was because he never had any sort of dreams or plans. Never any vision of hope or compassion for anyone. He was just a human being living in fear. Andy succeeds because he has learned to carry optimism on his shoulders. He eventually teaches Red the same lesson.The spoiler's over. Moving on, the film illustrates the passing time, which I mentioned was decades, beautifully and naturally. The film will seem long to some, but it shows how slowly the prison life plods along. How mundane and redundant it must get to get up, confined to small rooms, and work for very low wages every day. And you thought your corporation job was miserably insufferable.But where Shawshank really excels is in its humanism. It evokes prisoners as people, with morals and livelihood. Not as monsters. It is true, many, many people in prison deserve to be there, but we never look past the caricature of a psychopath or a deviant when we think about what kinds of people are really in there. They're not all bad people. People who question me on that should contemplate long and hard on this question; is Red a bad person? Or even a monster? The Shawshank Redemption is a marvelous journey through parts rarely explored. It is immersing in not only its characters and story, but in its touching, light cinematography which projects a wide range of dispositions throughout the entire excursion. Rarely does a film rub us this way, and rarely does one seem to rub everyone the same way. All the more reason, its placement on the ""Top 250"" really isn't an exaggeration.Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gutton. Directed by: Frank Darabont.",10
"I loved this movie! Beautifully filmed, the story is told as if time does not matter. No plot that has to be rushed through, no fast cars or anything. Just a very good story by Stephen King, marvellous actors and a lot of exciting emotions. It made me feel good to watch a man who keeps his hope for so many years.The scene with the Mozart-record broke my heart!",4
"If you are looking for a story that is entertaining and just when you think you know the end you realize that this is not the case, this is the right movie, the dialogues are enveloping, the characters complex and immigrant and the relationship between them is intelligent and well managed.",9
"What can I say, the first time I watched this master piece I was going through an emotional roller coaster! At the beginning the injustice and unfortunate events the main character has to go through made me think how will I even finish watching this movie. I should add that this is one of my first prison movies that I watched. I was fully focused, invested, and I love how you can easily forget the reality you're in and just live through the eyes / perception of Andy Dufresne. There are a lot of lessons and morals you can learn from this one movie as well. There also isn't just drama and crime in this movie, there's a little bit of everything I would say. It started with a strong, emotional beginning and ended with a happy, fulfilling and justified life that Andy and his friend Red deserved! Speaking about Red, very interesting character, Morgan Freeman never disappoints with his narrating skills. I just love it how the author of this movie made a lot of other characters matter as well... To simply end my rambling / review, loved the movie, watched it more than once and I will continue watching it in the future! A well deserved 10 from me.",7
"This is why I have a problem with IMDB. They rated this film as the #1film of all time. Are you kidding me? It wouldn't make it into my top 50. Why? Because they are like the ""Peoples Choice Awards"". How about ""Citizen Kane"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", or any film Stanley Kubrick made from ""The Killing"" (1956) forward. They are all an order of brilliance above this film. Yes, it is entertaining and very good, but I can't stand a monologue that simply repeats what has already been shown. That is faulty direction. Why? Because Morgan Freeman is simply a narrator for what you are watching on the screen, like a football play by play announcer. Very overrated. I give it an 8. The people at IMDB think a comic book film is great. Very good, but not the ""#1 film in history"".",3
"This is a truly heart touching movie. One of the best movies I have seen. The story line is well written, the actors are all amazing in their roles. A mist watch. This is one of the best movies of all time. I never get tired of watching it.",10
"having this movie in your top ten best films of all time is like saying the greatest pieces of art ever painted are the ones they put on hotel walls. Maybe this is true in a sort of egalitarian, democratic and mind-numbingly banal way. A thoroughly ordinary film, that has been embraced by men who want to cry, have faith, and have equilibrium. Which is nice.",7
"Much has been written and praised (deservedly so) about ""The Shawshank Redemption."" The fact that it's #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing, directing, editing and cinematography, I'll just say how much the film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and, above all, perseverance, kept me going through many of life's travails. I think I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life (albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the greatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way). Yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. It's a real spiritual journey (visually as well); almost like Red has died at the end (leaving Hell/Shawshank) and is reborn in Zihuatanejo (Heaven)to be rejoined with the one person who understands him. Just a marvelous, life-changing experience for me. My thanks to all who've supported and created this movie. It will live on and be remembered throughout the years as one of the pinnacles of human achievement.",4
"It's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since ""The Crying Game."" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.",10
"One of those films you must see in your lifetime. The soundtrack alone is five stars! Sublime acting all around. A film that may have been a slow burn in popularity but has now established itself as a true hollywood masterpiece!! 🏅P.s. my all time fav line: ""the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.""",10
"Perfectly fine yarn, but those who are ranking it among the all-time greatest movies need to see some more flicks. The cliches are pretty heavy at times, and the moral of the story seems to be freedom _isn't_ a mental state, after all.",1
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" has so much skill which went into the production that it is regrettable that it's overlength undermines its attributes. Episodic, slack and slow formatting stretch the narrative far beyond what its material requires. The result is a fair film, with some worthy touches.",8
"One of the best films I've ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why, However if you're a big Sly or Arnold fan, you may not like it as it doesn't have any exploding cars, plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables",10
"This movie... is overrated. It's a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it is NOT the greatest movie ever made. Still, definitely worth a watch.",9
"This is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and no doubt the best of Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont created a masterpiece.It is a very intelligent story telling us how hard prison life can be. It critics the judgements of innocent prisoners. But the most I liked is that every time there is another interesting story that develops in this prison. At the last third of the movie we can enjoy the big surprise or the dessert. This novel is very nice told and it merits standing ovation. I and my wife rarely see such films. This is quality of film making and today where we are?   8.5/10.If you liked this don´t miss another masterpiece from the same director called ""THE GREEN MILE"".",10
"An absolutely flawless production. From the story to the acting to the way it was filmed and produced, this is a nearly perfect movie. It was like a great novel brought to life. This is a classic and one of the clear top movies of all time.",10
"What A Movie..Excelled In Every Aspect..Right From Start To Finish You Will Love How The Movie Goes On..Makes You Cry, Laugh, Anxiety,Tension..Etc.. Each And Every Expression You Can Feel On Your Face. Each And Every Aspect Of The Of The Movie Is Good. Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman TAKE A BOW. Bob Gun ton IS Also Excellent In His Role. James Whit more Also Gave a Great Performance The Way Frank Directed The Movie Is AMAZING. He Kept This Movie At a Great Steady Pace Along With The Writing And Great Cinematography.Each And Every Cast And Crew Did An Excellent Job..Do Yourself A Favor Go Watch The Movie.",10
"this movie is all about that great story King wrote, that with great cinematic expression, great acting, great sub plots, this is a movie you can see many and many times in your life and every single time you see it, it will deliver emotional good feelings...Andy Dufresne's expression on his face through out the whole movie is incredible, the very old guy with the bird, he's just perfect, i feel like he's my grandpa or something, you just can't help to not love him, his character is the one that really got me emotional... Morgan Freeman is great like in all his films, you just can't think of a better casting... i love this filmi'm not quite sure if it deserves to be #1 on the top 250 IMDb list, but well, you decide... hope you love it as much as i do !",10
"To be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life, Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the way it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. I've read a few (not that one) and what comes through in the movie doesn't seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may come along but it may be a while.",10
"Well now I've finally seen it, and I have to say after the tremendous build up from everyone I've spoken to (IMDB No.2!) etc.. I thought it was ..... OK.  I think I would have scored it higher if I'd seen it five years ago but now without nostalgic hindsight it's only a 7!! Shock.. This film is still well worth seeing but the characters are not as well crafted as in 'The Green Mile' nor do they command your compassion (Brooks excepted).I suppose I'd better see 'Hannibal' SOON!",10
"94 was such a great year for movies, we had cult classic's like Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction & Speed, But I always thought out of all those.. Shawshank was a movie which didn't get the recognition it deserved from critics and viewers alike. Call me a snob I don't think you cannot call yourself a movie buff, unless you've seen this movie.The plot revolves around an innocent banker sent to prison charged of murder of his wife and befriends an old friendly character portrayed perfectly by Morgan Freeman. Andy Dufriene is a eccentric prisoner and when you live his life (visually of cource) it defines what solace really is. Happiness and sorrow.This movie is definitely worth a buy without question, so do yourself a favour and purchase it ASAP!",10
"If you want to see hope in its most poetic and dramatic sense, choose The Shawshank Redemption. I commend it to everyone who thinks movies are more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life and its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such compelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what redemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if we let it reign inside of us.From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of each character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office title. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best Picture by far.",10
"Where do I start? When I first heard of The Shawshank Redemption I immediately wanted to watch it, mostly of its title, so as I always do I looked it up on IMDb and looked at the rating. It was the highest ranked movie on IMDb, and of course I would give it a go. The beginning was very interesting, with Andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty, serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in America, Shawshank. I thought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather, but no, it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. The dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the emotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it is the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The amazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with ""Red"" walking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it makes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank is. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it didn't win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but get a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up very fast.",7
"I have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. On the left is 'The Dark Knight' and on the right is 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. These are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and, in my opinion, are the greatest films of my generation. I have watched each countless times because they're filled with action, suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome.Then, purely because it was rated highly, I watch a film not of my generation, on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special effects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance. Each are excellent. Shawshank's better.",10
"This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation. The drama was compelling, the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection. The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration. This is a great example of what film making is all about. It doesn't rely heavily on ""movie magic,"" but instead uses camera movement, framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences.",10
"This movie is a masterpiece. You may have seen some good movies but few can compare to this one. This is the plot. In 1947 a wrongly accused banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank Prison for murdering his wife. He meets the corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the brutal corrections officer, Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). He also meets the prison fixer Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was also incarcerated for murder. Andy and Red soon become good friends. Then one day while tarring the license plate factory roof, Andy helps Captain Hadley organize his money in a way that the government will be unable to take any taxes. Hadley tells the other officers about it, including Warden Norton and Andy is soon doing tax returns for all the guards in Shawshank. Life is becoming better for Andy and his fellow inmates, when he pushes for more books for the prison library. Meanwhile the old prison librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) is paroled from Shawshank. But Brooks can not adapt to life on the outside and hangs himself. Then things get worse when Norton tries to get more money from illegal activities using Andy. In 1963 a new prisoner named Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) arrives at Shawshank and reveals that he knows the man that killed Andy's wife. Andy tries to bring this up to Norton, but Norton puts Andy in solitary and has Hadley kill Tommy to keep him quiet. Now Andy has just about had enough. In 1947 Red got Andy a rock hammer, which he used to dig a tunnel under his Rita Hayworth poster. When he was released from solitary years later he uses it and escapes Shawshank. He turns Norton and Hadley to the police, who arrest Hadley. Norton on the other hand kills himself. In 1967 Red is paroled. He fears he will end up like Brooks but he made a promise to Andy to help him set up a hotel in Mexico so Red travels there where the two friends are united. This film is great for a number of reasons. The friendship aspect between Andy and Red which grows over a long period of time. It also addresses the issue of rehabilitation and if prisoners who have been in there a large portion of their lives can ever be rehabilitated or if they just become adapted to prison life so much that they falter if sent to the outside world. Overall it's just a great movie so I hugely recommend it.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994) I've seen this film in its entirety now. Initially, I was afraid it would be a violent prison movie with very little meaning and would have very little to move me to tears. But it did. The film was Oscar worthy but it was a film that lost that year to ""Forest Gump"". Its release on VHS made the film very popular. Cable television airs the film frequently and it's even the stuff that film screenplay classes study as a sample of brilliant movie. Based on the short story by Stephen King ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" it tells the story of wealthy banker Andy (Tim Robbins) accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The time at the start of the film is the 1940's and by the end of the film it's the 1960's. Andy has been sent to Shawshank, a notorious prison (in Washington state or Oregon) where harsh discipline is provided by the Warden (Bob Gunton) and by its captain of prison guards. The elements of a prison movie are indeed here (nightmarish conditions, cruel punishment, gay prisoners raping straight/hetero prisoners) but it becomes a prison movie at a higher level with its theme of redemption and humanity, hope and perseverance. The bond between Morgan Freeman's character and Tim Robbins is perhaps the most poignant relationship of any two men portrayed on film. The prisoners have lost hope and although not bitter, become very comfortable with prison life and know no other type of life. This was the tragedy of the prison librarian who after decades of prison life, could not cope with the real world that had changed after his release. His suicide is extremely depressing. The ""bad guys"" turn out to be not the criminals who attempt to rehabilitate themselves but the hypocritical and cruel Warden. Andy is innocent as proved by a later inmate's confession to knowing the true culprit (played by Gil Bellows) but the Warden is too bent on keeping his image of having always done justice and keeps Andy in prison. The grim aspects of the film are nevertheless lightened by humor, good writing, nuance in character and scenes that have such power and subtlety. The scene in which Andy plays an opera album (Le Nozze Di Figaro by Mozart, duet ""Sull'aria from the 1968 Karl Bohm album with Edith Mathis and Gundula Janowitz) is so moving and so touching. Andy's subsequent escape and the table-turned justice when the investigation into the corruption of the prison leads to the demise of the administration.This movie ranks as one of the finest made in the 1990's, with excellent writing and fine acting. It's a movie that has become a classic and that continues to hold audiences enthralled.",10
"I'm sorry but I just don't get the big deal over this movie. 
It is pure melodramatic schmaltz.  Give me Cool Hand Luke or Papillon any day.  Or how about Scum or even Chopper.I have to admit I felt the same way about The Green Mile, maybe it's just Stephen King's view of prison I don't like.  As if he has a clue!I think he should just stick with the coming of age stuff (loved Stand By Me) and the isolated looneys (The Shining), things he can obviously relate to.  Leave prison stories to the folks who actually leave their house.",9
"Many reviews talk about how they don't have words that can describe this movie. I have the perfect word: vanilla This movie is the Toyota Camry of movies. Pleasant, but bland. It doesn't take any risks, just plays it safe and the result is a pleasant experience, but not a satisfying one. I would have liked to see more risks taken. How about some ground-breaking cinematography? What if some of the characters pushed the envelope a little further? Far enough to be accused of overacting by some? How about a parallel story? How about SEVERAL parallel stories? What about moving the story at a faster pace? The beginning of the movie was really quite slow...There is no reason this movie should be more than 2 hours. I give it only a 7 out of 10 for breaking no new ground. I think this movie fails to distinguish itself in my memory.",10
"This has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. I first saw it when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying it and i've watched it a few times since then.The characters have so much depth, you end up loving them the more you watch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little on Stephen King's novella.This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDb",10
"The best. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.",10
"This movie has been rated number one by IMDb for a reason. Why? What's not to like? It has everything. Crime, drama, romance, some comedy. The writers were very well set on what they wanted. They achieved it. One can watch this movie over and over. Every time I watch, I notice something new that I had not noticed before. This movie is very well written. This movie is very well produced. This movie is very well acted. This movie was very well financed. They did not need to use too much money to produce it however, one would never know. Yes. It's that good. This is definitely a movie that belongs on your shelf or in your movie collection. It's rated number one for a reason. Anyone who rates this below an eight, doesn't really know what a good movie is about. The way it's written, directed, acted, financed, produced and acted. If I had three thumbs, the would all be up. So, three thumbs up. If you've never seen this fantasias film, you're missing out. It's a must have. Enjoy.",10
"Rating: 6.9Well made but slow and uninteresting. It really didn't impact me like other people. Granted I watched this late-night but by the time the credits rolled I felt nothing. There were some small holes like Andy crawling through the wastewater pipe despite it raining (the pipe should be full), Andy pinning the poster back up all four corners despite being in a hole, Andy breaking an industrial pipe with a rock, the warden continuing scams despite andy being in solitary etc... but it ended well enough.",5
"Without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made, little to no continuity errors, fantastic acting and a thrilling and engaging story that keeps you hooked from start to end.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest examples of Stephen King's work adapted to the big screen. If not THE finest. Based on a short story from King's novella Different Seasons, it may be that rare thing where its a film that actually improves upon its source material. The story, of a man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover made for an interesting read, but it made for an even better film.Although TSR was nominated for seven Academy Awards, it didn't win a single one. Most of them went to the completely overrated Forrest Gump, including Best Picture and Best Actor. I think that was one of the Academy's darkest days.Despite the fact TSR did next to no business in 1994, it quickly gathered word of mouth afterwards, and went on to a healthy afterlife on video and TV. But that's not all. It slowly worked its way into the hearts and minds of people the world over, and today it's regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Even a true American classic. And its even No 2 on the IMDb top 250. Beating out Forrest Gump by a significant margin!TSR is also one of the few films in the world that actually deserves all the acclaim it receives. I really loved this movie. I loved everything about it. The theme of maintaining hope in the face of crushing despair could have made for Hallmark TV movie material, but in the hands of first time director Frank Darabont, he's created an utter masterpiece.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the man who allegedly did the crime. He is convicted and ordered to serve two consecutive life sentences in Shawshank State Prison. Robbins' performance is interesting if you've seen the one other really good film he made in 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy. There he played a bumbling, doltish fool. His work in TSR is a jarring about face.He completely downplays his emotions to the point of resigned dourness. Its quite a shocking thing to watch. But as good as Robbins' performance is, what makes it that all the more special is Andy's character is opened up not by him, but by an external character.Morgan Freeman, in arguably the best performance of his career plays Red, the prison fixer. He can get things for any inmate. Whether it be cigarettes, or a rock hammer. He is the narrator of the picture, and it is through his words that the world of Shawshank becomes a harsh and frightening reality.He knows the ins and outs of the prison system. When new inmates arrive, he can usually tell which ones won't last. He knows your first night at Shawshank is the worst. New inmates have to endure the catcalls and taunts of their cellmates. Red pegged Andy as the one who would break first. But he never did.Red freely admits he didn't think much of Andy at first. But slowly, the two men become acquaintances, and much later, friends. Morgan Freeman's resigned, soothing voice illuminates the harsh surroundings of the prison walls. The scariest thing about the prison was the Sisters. Sadistic prisoners who turned gay while locked up, and try to convert others. First through suggestion. And if that fails, force. Andy was their favourite target. And he had to endure rapes and beatings for his first two hellish years at Shawshank.Andy's background as an investment banker brings him to the attention of Warden Norton. Norton is a hypocritical tyrant. He claims to be a devout Christian, but he won't tolerate any challenges to his authority. Any who do wind up in solitary. For months at a time if necessary. Norton has Andy secure funds he has embezzled. And in exchange, Andy can procure funds for a new library and even beers for his fellow inmates. As long as he does exactly what Norton tells him to.The Shawshank Redemption resonates on many different levels as it tells many different stories. One of the most poignant is the plight of Brooks, an elderly inmate. Imprisoned for years, when he finally makes parole, he is terrified. Life at Shawshank has become the only life he's ever known. Once released, he knows he'll never survive out there. And he's right. The world has gone and changed on him. And life as a grocery bagger is no life at all. So he hangs himself. Its a haunting story. And one that never fails to choke me up inside.That situation extends to Red too. In Shawshank, he has a purpose. He is respected, valued, needed. Parole is not much different than a death sentence. He gets rejected for parole frequently over the course of 30 years. And he couldn't be happier.The most wrenching thing of all is Andy's apparent deterioration. He believes in hope. And tries to inspire some in his cellmates when he plays Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over the PA system. That scene is a joyful moment to behold, with the men in the yard transfixed by the music. And Norton punishes him for his defiance. Andy seems to reach breaking-point when he confesses to Red he might as well have murdered his wife, because he didn't show her enough love and affection.It seems Norton has finally broken Andy. But when Andy escapes, its a triumphal moment. That famous scene, after Andy crawls 500 yds through a sewage pipe, standing in a downpour, relishing his first taste of freedom. It will send your spirits sky-high.Things end appropriately with Andy and later Red gaining freedom, on a secluded island. I love the way the camera observes their reunion from a distance. After their souls have been laid to bear, they deserve some privacy. One of the defining pictures of our generation. An experience I love to re-visit over and over.Magnificent!",10
Still not as good as Mario Bros 2 best game of the year 70 years in a row,10
"Words cannot encompass how great this film was. The acting, plot, and even the soundtrack was absolutely spot on. I'm not exaggerating it, but this film really felt like it transcended past me just enjoying the film to actually feeling the film in my soul. To feel that pit in your stomach, the ache in your heart, to the warmth that spreads throughout your body, I was just left in awe of the marvel before my eyes. Even after the end credits roll, I was lost for words. My curiosity as to why this film is first in IMDb's Top 250 movies list is finally quenched and I leave with a smile on my face and happiness in my heart. Don't think I'll need to say this but I'll definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. Just know that the better the films you see, the worse the bad ones get.",10
"I can understand why this film is loved so much, but I can equally understand, although I do not agree, why it is despised. People say it is life affirming, brings hope and happiness, and it does, others say it is sentimental crap, and at times it is. But I've always been a sucker for sentimental movies, ones which have the power to genuinely move the viewer, and not hide under a cheap plot and a tragic death. Being another King adaptation, there is violence, and hardness to counteract the sentimentality, and the prison, although not as horrifying as those seen in Midnight Express and other movies, breaks the human soul to the point that it relies on the prison for survival. Heartbreaking, tear jerking, brutally funny, all phrases used repeatedly to describe this film, all appropriate. A film everyone should love. Great Quotes: Andy. 'I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged' 9 out of 10",9
"This film wasn't that successful when it was released. Over the years since then, it's become regarded by many people as one of the best films ever made. It's an above-average prison film that's well-acted - but it's nothing special. It's slow and too long. Many fans of this film claim that it's a feel-good film - an uplifting story about friendship and mental strength. Some even claim that watching it can cure depressed viewers. However, it's a heavy-going film that includes beatings and rape.We never find out whether or not the protagonist committed the double murder that he's imprisoned for, which is a crucial point as a viewer. If he's innocent, then we should be on his side and want him to escape; if he's guilty, then he's not a sympathetic character.",10
"POSITIVES:1) Tim Robbins not even being Oscar nominated for this film is a disgrace, he gives one of the best acting performances of all time
2) The score is amazing
3) The cinematography is outstanding
4) I'm not normally a big fan of narration but Morgan Freeman's narration is flawless
5) The entire sequence narrated by Brooks is absolutely heartbreakingNEGATIVES:1) The film is a bit too cheesy at times when it is trying to be heartwarming
2) The hero being convicted for a crime he didn't commit, along with the corrupt warden and prison guards, is very cliche
3) It is an unbelievable coincidence that Andy meets a prisoner that shared a cell with the man that actually killed Andy's wife and bragged about it",9
"The Shawshark Redemption is very good movie. This is a story that reflect prisons as seen by many prisoner. The Shawshark Redemption also reflect society problems. The plots and actors played very well that make me wanted to continue watch. They are very professional as a director and actor. they capture and identify with America male spirit as it shows in movie. The story is even more interesting seeing red and Andy building a relationship in a prison. Scenes are very good. Overall, this is a fantastic film.Comparing this kind of movie with other type of movie like comedy,I recommended every movie lover to watch this or you will be missing one of the best film.",10
"In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film in the whole way of action and how we learning from this movie. Shawshank encompasses friendship , hardship , hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going though. These artists show their capability to produce art, real art that in spires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.So, Shawshank is the must see movie in your life before you gone.",10
"Different people may see the same video differently. Regarding my current inability to change the status quo, the deepest feeling after watching this film is that talent and perseverance are the best way for anyone to be free in any situation.
The young banker in the film, with his proficient knowledge of bank finance, not only won his life safety and a little freedom in prison, but also gained material and spiritual benefits for his inmates. It is also because of his mastery of finances that the actor finally defeats the cruel and insidious warden in the end and gives himself material freedom.
On the other hand, look at the weekly application letter for six years, the application letter twice a week for N years, the tunnel that was dug out day by day with the stone axe that ""cannot dig a tunnel for 600 years,"" The sewer pipe smashed with stones, the rotten sewer with a length of 500 while vomiting and crawling ... all these draw a word deeply: perseverance.
Anyone who wants to finally get the freedom under the blue sky and white clouds must have these two kinds of talents--excellent talent and tenacity.",10
"If you haven`t seen this film, watch it as soon as you can. Maybe you`ve had the chance to do it, but just skipped it because you thought it was one more story in prison. Yes and no! YES because most part of ""Shawshank Redemption"" happens in a prison, but NO, it's not like the others. It's much better.The story, you may know more of it in the Plot Outline, is really interesting and the performances are just impossible to forget. There is a little of everything: drama, friendship, violence, love and dream...""Dream of Freedom"". That's the title in Portuguese.My Rate 9/10",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Based on the 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a wrongfully convicted accountant who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary.The film is a powerful and emotional masterpiece, featuring brilliant performances from Robbins and Freeman. The characters are complex and well-developed, and the story is both heart-wrenching and uplifting. The cinematography is stunning, and the film's themes of hope and friendship are universal and timeless.Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a must-see for any film fan. It is a poignant and moving tale that will leave a lasting impact on its audience.",10
"A simple brilliant movie in all aspects. I am not sure how many times I have watched it and each time it still has the same effect. When you feel low, watch this ""hope is indeed a good thing"".",10

"My friend asked me that question and I said... TODAYI saw The Shawshank Redemption today, yes nearly after 14 years it was released and after 26 years of my life on earth... I should have seen it much before, I guess. I am truly moved by the story and more than that by the character roles played by Morgan (Red) and Tim (Andy). I have to admit, this is not one of the greatest, BUT THE GREATEST movie ever produced.Brooks was there, so was Red... I wish I was also there to see it for real.This movie gave me new avenues, new thoughts, new energy and more than everything... it gave me what it gave Morgan Freeman... HOPE",10
A movie based on a Stephen King book could be great or awful. Thankfully this was amazing.,10

"I have often wondered, before seeing this film,how on Earth in became the No.1 rated film on IMDb. I felt it was certainly overrated as there were some masterpiece films that I believed deserved a higher rating, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather Parts I and II as well as other classics like the first Matrix.However, I finally watched the film and I was completely stunned. I just never expected the film to contain so much emotion and so little of worthless action. This film is one of the best films ever made and I believe it certainly does deserve a No.1 ranking on IMDb.The acting in this film is just superb, especially by Morgan Freeman. I mean, this legend, is in some of the best films ever made like Shawshank Redemption, Se7en and the Dark Knight. Morgan Freeman is simply unbelievable in this film and the relationship between his character, Red and Andy was just superbly filmed. It actually gave me tears****SPOILERS****When Brooks was finally released from Shawshank, he realises the outside world is too much for him and commits suicide. This scene was just so sad it left me crying. The same when Red was released, I again started crying. The scene were Norton kills himself was totally surprising and a shock to me, realizing that Andy had truly defeated him and there was nothing for him to live for.The ending scene where Red and Andy reunite after all those days, or years, was just breathtaking and I was glad the film ended the way it did. I've heard people complaining about the ending, saying that it was too long and extended, but I strongly believe this ending worked perfectly well.****END OF SPOILERS****Overall, if anyone hasn't seen this film I'll tell you know....GO WATCH THE FILM....You won't regret it.",10
"This is without a doubt my favorite movie. Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic. Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it.Robbins, Freeman and Whitmore's characters are the ones that I like the most.It is just stupid, unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes. The IMBD voters have it at #2. My hope is to see it in the future at #1.",10
"Andy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison due to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan Freeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship of all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and guides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his loyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and his moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part of a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone, weak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness of the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told to us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and the hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has a very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its wonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their psychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely everything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of every time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot. The one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in the director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment, Andy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very old and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as he cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the hardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the end there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is that, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece.",10
"Gut-wrenching! Beautiful! Intelligent! A masterpiece! The actors are perfect in their roles, I am surprised Tim Robbins didn't rise higher in his stardom than what he actually did after making this movie. The chemistry between him and Morgan Freeman is perfect! Every single character makes sense and seems ""real"". The dialogues are realistic as well. It portrays the corruption going on within heavily guarded facilities (such as this one) in such a simple, yet brutal way - that despite the crime committed (with a few exceptions of course) it makes you question the justice system and its fairness. I can relate to people I would never have thought I would in real life. I won't say much more about this movie, except tell you to watch it! Even if its not your type of movie, even if you tend to get bored with dramatic tales - anyone can learn something from experiencing watching it! Just be prepared to feel real human emotions. If you don't then something is seriously wrong with you!",10
"This film should be joint along with The Godfather as being the greatest film of all time. The character development and the messages that is conveying is beautifully done. When the messages such as hope, friendship and survival come together, it makes an excellent display.It consisted of different metaphors when they were drinking the liquor on top the roof, and Morgan Freeman was narrating his thoughts as feeling that they were a free man, this was the best moment of the film and made me how at that time people were living in jails.Excellent. Prefect. Outstanding film, best jail film I saw in my entire life...10/10 PS watch out for the new drama that came out in the UK... Prison Break on channel five. If you liked Shawshank then you will like this.",6
"The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. This is a film that focuses on what happens to people when imprisoned. The different experiences had amongst each character are all representative of what kind of person the character is. This movie has gorgeous cinematography and classic dialogue, this paired with the peaceful yet ominous score make an amazing atmosphere. On top of all these technical marvels you also have one of the best stories ever told. The Shawshank Redemption is truly a work of art.",9
What can I say? Probably the best movie of all time. Really well written story with a beginning a middle and an end.,10
Well made movie with a great story. very long and dragged at times (2 viewings),10
Real good movie....but has taken a lot from Papillon (1973),10
Saw this film and it was excellent entertainment i liked brooks and felt sorry him when he was released as he had became institutionalized and he had only seen a car once and now life is also busy and he ends up in a shop packing bags for customers and his manager is a bit of a to him well i wont tell you what happens if you have never seen the movie before anyway the rest is about a convicted banker who has been detained for 30 years after killing his wife and lover but there is more to the story then this its just about folk trying get by on a day to day basis in prison and having to put up with sadistic guards and other prisoners who want to jump you at any chance in more ways then one,10
"As we all know, valling something a 10/10 is a high statement to say in this world. I believe that this is one of them, and I don't think anyone should think it isn't. If anyone thinks this movie is bad, they either haven't seen it or they just misunderstood it. Let's start off with the themes. The themes about friendship and hope in this movie were potrayed perfectly, especially friendship. There was even a moment where friendship really was one of, if not the main theme of this movie. Next, let's talk about outside parts. The cinematography was one of the things that were just perfect. The acting and music were also some things that were just perfect. One last thing, the backstories to characters. This definitely fits in for being in the debate of the ""greatest movie of all time"". Once I have kids in the future, once they are ild enough, I can't going to have to make them watch this movie. This perfectly portrays that if you get too used to something, you wouldn't want it to leave for your whole life.",10
"You won't regret seeing this movie. Even if you love movies such as Fast and Furious, you will like this one. It's impossible not to like it.",10
"Like a lot of people, didn't really seem an interesting title when it was released. WHOA. This is a movie that I know I've watched the most number of times than any other movie. Fantastic movie.",9
"I have always heard what a great movie it was but never got myself to watch it since I didn't want to watch a prison movie. However, I am so glad I watched it! I was sort-of suicidal when I watched it; and it gave me hope and made my heart warm even when I was at my lowest!",10
"You may think 10/10 is a given, but the way I see it 10/10 is perfection. This movie is NOT perfect. It relies too much on the ending. The first 2 hours of the movie ( great as it is ) is lacking complexity. The remaining 20 minutes fools you into thinking it's the best movie ever made. But I am here to tell you It's NOT!
I love this movie with all my heart but I just don't think it deserves the number one spot.",10
This is exactly the type of movie the new era cinema need ... Magic!,4
"I can't put into words how great this movie is, this is probably the greatest movie of all time.",10
"This movie provides positive proof that the IMDb website has security holes. Somehow the family members of the filmmakers hacked the system to grossly inflate the votes for this movie. How else to explain the No. 2 ranking of a film that probably does not belong in the Top 2000? It is an entertaining prison yarn but there are at least twenty prison movies that are superior to this and the filmmakers had the good sense to borrow from these (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, etc.). In fact, the same director's The Green Mile, which is also based on a Stephen King story and set in a prison, is a better film. On the acting front, Robbins and Freeman are always watchable.",10
One of the rare occasions where the movie is as good if not better than the book.,10
"This is one of my favourite films ever. Why? Well a lot of reasons really. But mostly because of the plot. It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art. The actors are superb (note: Freeman - why he didn't receive an Oscar for this one, I'll never understand). The story is great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King (Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all among my absolute top films. Try them out. I promise you all several great movie-moments.",10
"No matter how much i talk about this movie i wouldn't give it justice. The movie got nominated for a lot of awards won nothing but the people loved it its been the no. 1 movie of all times by over 2 million people votes the story the direction the actors it's a piece of work, it makes you angry, happy, emotional and inspiration.
You should watch if you haven't already",10
"Oh my God, I no doubt about it, love this movie more than any other I've ever seen!!!!! I mean, the script is just breathtakingly brilliant, and the acting was superb, PERFECT even. I can watch this movie any time of the day, because it never gets old and I never like it less. I am so glad to know that it is highly appreciated on here as well, and it needs to be, this movie KICKS ASS!!!!! If you're a hater, you don't know what a good movie is, and get a life, but if you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY, ""HIGHLY"" recommend you see it right away for you have missed out on something special your entire laugh, and truthfully, that makes me sad. SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION IS TRULY THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!",10
What a great movie. It's been my fave for years but I never knew just how many other people liked it until I saw that it was ranked #1 on the top 250 list here at IMDB. It may not be the greatest movie ever made but everyone who has seen it liked it. I can't imagine anyone hating this movie. The best part of the whole movie is when Red walks down the beach in Mexico and meets his friend on the boat. You know everything's going to be okay after that.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent example of Hollywood craftsmanship. It has believable acting, excellent pacing, good cinematography and tells the story in a very effective manner. But it is film as a craft, not as an art.To put this film in the same category as those of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Truffaut or Bergman is like comparing a piece of quality furniture to a Picasso.I doubt even one in a hundred people, who hold this film in such high regard as to vote it #2, could actually name the director if you asked them in the street.",10
"This film is overrated, it can't possibly be the best film ever, there are much better films than that, however it is still a good film.",1
"The story's quite plain, the acting is OK but nothing really over the top, even though the soundtrack, the quality of the shots and the atmosphere really stood out! I think it's for obvious sentimental reasons that people like this movie! The good guy takes a lot of crap but wins in the end because he's smart!! There are way better movies than this one and I really can't understand why so many people rate it 10!! 10 equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it!! I think 7 is a very high rating and this movie probably doesn't deserve more than an 8 maximum!! The masses don't necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained, that's what the movie industry is about! Still, this movie was quite gay! Way too much emo and way to predictable!",9
I know each scene and each line by heart. What a movie. I am a picky movie watcher. I hardly rate a movie 9 or 10. Without a question this is 10!,1
This is certainly not a bad film but it is Also completely overated in my opinion. This story has been done a million times and How the wardens didn't notice he was chipping through the wall everyday to escape is beyond me. The acting throughout is very good but i am shocked to see this number 1 on the chart.,10
"This film has always been regarded as a treasure by filmmakers in various countries and regions. If the re-evaluation of classic movies is regarded as an act that can't keep up with the trend, then I'm sorry, I'm late.
To be honest, I used to scoff at these classic movies. I think that's just because they fit the appetite of the film festival judges, so they are popular with ordinary people.
But on a boring night, I couldn't sleep, and opened it with a try mentality. In the following more than 100 minutes, I was deeply attracted by it.Red said hope is dangerous and the source of mental distress. He had been in the jail for thirty years, and he was indeed qualified to say so.Because from the day he came in, the warden said, ""Give your soul to God and your body to me."" Except for the cigarettes and poker cards with naked girls that he can get, any other changes in this dark Nothing seems to grow inside the high walls.But Andy told him, ""Remember, hope is a good thing-maybe even the best of the world. And good things never disappear.""So Andy was able to use two decades to dig a tunnel that Rhett thought could not be drilled for six hundred years. When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of foul-stained sewage pipe, standing in the pouring rain, he couldn't help but feel as if we saw faith pierce the dark curtain and hit a thunderbolt in the dark night. In the light, our cowardly souls appeared and shuddered under Andy's open arms.",10
"What can i say?...The only film to make a grown man cry! No film comes close to this in any way or form,it draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene!.Enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.",10
"One of the best movies ever made! This movie is a masterpiece not to be forgotten. There is no other movie like this, and you won't regret it if you watch it. I'm.",10
My lifetime favourite movie in Hollywood. Can't believe such a wonderful screenplay and characterization in jail. This movie will be speaker for generations. Hatssof To the screenwriting and director. Morgan always rocks. Salute to director and screenwriting,10

It is a great piece of film making and a story of hope. Justice is done at the end. I also recommend you watch Female Prisoner Scorpion.,9
"Andy and Rhett's conversation is so classic. When Andy says he wants to go to a hotel on Mexico's Pacific coast to spend his life. How can it be said that Rhett did not believe it? A man sentenced to life in prison is daydreaming. This is the gap, the gap of thought, the gap of value. It is the gap between the world, that is why there will be winners and losers in this world, there will be the poor and the rich, there will be this story It is not terrible that people are trapped by high walls, because some people are not trapped. Feathery birds always belong to the sky, can not close. But if the mind is trapped in a wall, people are trapped in it.",10
"Shawshank may not be the best film of all time, but for me it was perfect. A film is perfect (for me) if it shows a character who wins against insurmountable odds (Robbins). Another essential ingredient for a perfect film is a character who, by his actions, changes the life of another human being for the better (again, Robbins). The last 15 minutes of the film are so gripping: we don't know what is going to happen to Freeman, but we are so involved at this point that any other ending would be unthinkable. I loved this film!",10
"I have read tons of people getting off watching this pile of random prison drama, and I cannot believe this is the highest rated movie on IMDb. I never liked Morgan Freeman. Really. He always plays the wise man in movies, and that is quite unbearable. Not only it jails him (lol) to a specific, unrisky role as an actor, but it's also outrageously pretentious. Tim Robbins is OK I guess. So you get to see some fishy business involving cigarettes and rocks for two hours, spiced by some five-year-old melancholic philosophy. End of story, If you like prison drama, go watch The Green Mile. I wasted two hours so you won't, you're welcome.",10
Its a perfect example of a movie that never gets old. Love it.,10
"It is no surprise that this movie is simply tremendous. This review probably won't even be seen because so many people gave 10 star reviews. I guarantee that if you check the 1 star reviews there either won't be any or it will be a bunch of 6 year old's talking crap. I love this movie more than I should. And it is rare that a Stephen King movie is better than the book. This deserves so many rewards. The acting is phenomenal. And I can not even say that I found any flaws. If you haven't watched it already, (which you probably have.) I highly recommend it. If you are searching for a movie better than a book, here it is. It will not waste your time.",10
"I like this movie.It has a great-deep message about life,freedom and friendship.",10
#2 favorite movie in the database? Mein Gott!! Surely you jest.Big-budget marquee name rip-off of the ever popular naif-in-prison B-film standard. Except the B movies don't pretend they aren't going for the shock/schlock appeal.Utter rubbish.,1
Overrated. Drastically.Tim Robbins is okay. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman.,10
"The director definately knew what he was doing when he got the highly emotional and sad script on his desk: ""Deborah!? Get me the two actors in hollywood with the saddest faces, even when they're not crying! I have a tearjerker to make, and this time I won't take any chances!""
Joking aside; This movie is very very good, but it is not a 10! Please stop crying before you write your review... (also a joke)",10
"The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.""",10
"They say there are no perfect movies. Most of the time that holds true. But this is the one exception. I find no faults in The Shawshank Redemption. It is indeed a perfect film if ever there was one. It is wildly entertaining and extremely insightful. You won't want to blink for fear of missing something. You are able to identify and sympathize with the main character, and with his friend, who provides the greatest bits of narration of any film ever. This is not an exaggeration. Furthermore, we learn something about ourselves and our fellow human beings by watching this film. It is a work of art and a bit of real life. The production values are amazing. It should have won ten Oscars.",10
"Best movie. Must see. Engrossing.
Great story, good acting, good direction.",7
"The Shawshank Redemption lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to the new visual effects technology utilized in Forrest Gump. In addition, Shawshank only made 10% of the box office gross as Gump, which received far more press coverage due to the visual effects used in the film. Gump is a great film and deserved the Oscar for visual effects, but its story does not compare to the brilliance of Shawshank. The ability to see Tom Hanks shaking hands with dead presidents in the White House amazed movie goers and the box office receipts amazed the Academy members. Shawshank is an amazing story and an outstanding film; whereas, Gump is a series of vignettes exploited by the new visual effects technology.",10
I love this film I don't know if it's Morgan freeman's voice or the acting or even the music it's all there but I know that it tells an amazing story.,7
"My impression is that since the early ninenties and especially  after ""green fried tomatoes"" was released movies regarding human relations and/or tragedy and using narative as their spine became fashionable..Countless movies followed that i dont care to mention most of them inferior than the original they tried to follow and one of them is Shawshank redemption.Sure it is not a mellow love story but about life in prison that is objectively hard.But somehow the typical ingredients are there.The film is mostly sad and melodramatic and one can even consider it romantic in a way.Despite its strong cast and a good storyline it does not avoid all these characteristic cliches that sadly deprive it from any real replay value.Rent it on dvd and you wont be disapointed by viewing it but the second best movie of all times it aint and you will know this because you wont feel the need to watch it now and then as it happens at least to me  with movies that are really classics...Not a bad movie but highly overrated....3 out of five stars.",10

"This film deserves something like a 7 or an 8, but I have been forced to score it drastically in some attempt to right the terrible injustice that has been done.WHO is voting this film so highly? It is a nice film. A NICE film. IT IS NOT THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!! I can only assume it has been voted as such because people liked the ""shocking"" ending and the happiness brought to them by Morgan Freeman's voice caressing their ears.There is also a seriously unpleasant rape scene in there, none of the characters do very much, and there is a particularly depressing suicide scene. How any of this makes for 9.3/10, I have no idea. Can people stop giving films ridiculous ratings, so that people like me have to counterbalance those (undeserved) ratings with mean ones? Please? Just say no.",7
"People wonder why I hate this movie so much, and I have to say that its just purely unoriginal.  I mean c'mon... how many times have you heard the story of a guy who's wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison using a stupid spoon? If there's one thing I look for in a movie, then it's got to be originality.  I'll let it go if its based on a novel, or a musical, but c'mon... a plot this unoriginal doesn't deserve any credit!",10
"Three words: ""Cool Hand Luke.""  Same film, done better, done earlier.  For that matter, is this film any better than other Steven King ""novelettes"" such as ""Stand By Me""? All in all, it probably ranks a 6 or a 7, but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film, I give it a 1 in one man's attempt at sanity.",10
"This is a great movie. At first, when I heard that Stephen King was one of the authors I didn't expect it to be this good, I don't enjoy horror movies but later I understood that it wasn't a horror movie so I watched it and I enjoyed every minute of it. Excellent performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.",10
"This movie was excellence at it's best.  In my mind, it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end.  That's what this one did to me.  Besides the point that the acting was some of the best you'll see in the 90's.  The story was golden.  If you haven't seen this, get it now.",10
Shawshank redemption is world's best movie ever made. I will remember this movie throughout my life. Pls pls watch this movie. It will change your perspective.,1
"Absolutely the best movie I have seen in my lifetime.  I'm a hardcore action fan, but I sat and watched this movie and never checked the time.  This movie is compelling.  Tim Robbins gives a great performance nonetheless, but it is Morgan Freeman's character that adds such emotion to the movie.  I always catch the movie on TNT and I watch it to the end.  The end is fantastic, and it leaves me with tingles (if you know what I mean). Morgan Freeman's line ""Get busy living, or get busy dying..."" is one to remember. He adds so much feeling to the movie, and the entire thing is flawless. There isn't a line or scene out of place in the entire thing.  I sat there thinking hard about the movie for a while, but then I got up and headed to the nearest shop.  That movie was going to be my own.",5
"in my opinion ,it's better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale , so this time the escape is greater! and the hero is an ordinary man , who is so patient and hopeful, while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that it's social or silly story, but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong, it's a Brilliant Story,a never seen before , a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characters,like hating,and true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman,I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....",6
"Best movie ever. I've seen it about 25 times now, and it never gets boring.",8
"This wasn't a bad movie by any means, in fact it was pretty good. Good story, good acting, fairly dramatic, it has most of the key elements in place. But after reading the book, which was amazing, watching this drawn out film version just isn't the same. Compared to some of the modern junk that's out there, Shawshank is pretty solid. But overall, it truly is overrated, and #2 all time is silly.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",8
"This and the Fight Club and two of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. Sure this is nice- got lots of nice talk, nice interracial bonding in a prison, lots of sub stories about a crappy Warden etc. Sure its got a plan to get out, plan that ultimately fruitions but come on- people talk like this is Jesus's Second Coming or whatever. This is cliché driven drivel of the highest order. Spend your 2 hours elsewhere.",10
"I am dumbfounded by the exorbitant praise for this movie. It is almost frightening--like a cult.  I watched it last night and was completely underwhelmed.  This did not have have half the emotional charge of a dozen other prison flicks, not to mention other dramatic categories.  Yes, the story was OK, good (not great) acting, but I found it to be largely insipid and predictable.  It just did not grab me like other stories of redemption such as A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life.  As you can see by my citing these two films, I am not offended by cheesy sentimentality, if well done.  Shawshank simply had nothing new to say or a new way to say it.  The only reason I am writing this review is to demonstrate that there are indeed some people who are not swept away by this movie.  Otherwise, I would not have bothered.  The film simply was not interesting enough.",9
"It's not a bad film.  It's just derivative and melodramatic.  It borrows from ""Cool Hand Luke,"" a superior film.  It relishes its significance too much.  It's a bit smug.  Morgan Freeman's voiceover is a clumsy narrative device.  I don't know -- I just know for sure it's not one of ""the best films of all time.""  Not even close.",10
"Share some of the sentences in this movie.
1.It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another.
2.Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.",10
"Is there anyone who does not like this film?  If there is, I've never met them.  ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film that doesn't sound too interesting when you first hear about it.  A banker who protests his innocence after his wife and her lover are killed befriends a group of prisoners and changes everyone's life for the better.  It does not sound that great to most people, but when you see this film you will honestly come away loving every frame of it.  Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is greater, and the supporting cast are all perfect.  William Sadler, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows stand out as well.  James Whitmore, who has been in acting since the 1940s, gives his best performance as Brooks and should have at least received an Oscar nod.  If you haven't seen this film go and see it.  I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch on a rainy afternoon, or at anytime for that matter.  Frank Darabont, who had been involved in horror films before this, became a big-time name after this film.  Unfortunately, ""The Green Mile"" is nowhere close to comparing to this film which will be remembered forever.  A great achievement.  5 stars out of 5.",10
"This is the #1. Absolute must see film of the 1990s, Our Generation, anyone's lifetime and quite possibly the history of film. Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster. Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise you'll wish to share it with everyone you know. Don't think ""another Prison Movie"" about-this one, it's above and beyond that cliché. Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, and James Whitmore. Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast. I Cannot emphasize-the importance of this film. I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece. It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day. thank you.",10
"On Friday, March 20, 2020 I watched The Shawshank Redemption for the first time. The movie was on Netflix, I'd heard about it before, and I decided to watch it. If you haven't seen the movie before and want a spoiler-free review here it is: go watch the movie. Watch it. That's all I'm saying, because you need to formulate your own opinion on this thing. So, I'm going to be diving into spoilers now, if you haven't seen the movie go watch it as soon as possible.So, I saw this movie on Netflix and decided to watch it. I knew that it had been number one on IMDb for years, I knew there was endless praise, and it was considered a masterpiece. Usually, this amount of praise would get me hyped up for a film, but it didn't. I was eager to watch it, but I set my expectations low, preparing to be let down. I think this was done most effectively during the opening of the movie, which is a little slower than the rest. I went in thinking I would be disappointed, because no movie can ever live up to the expectation of being the greatest movie of all time. Let me tell you, I was wrong. I was very, very wrong. This film absolutely blew me away. Every expectation I had was shattered. I don't usually review movies, but this one just put too much on my mind. It's a masterpiece. After my first time watching it, this is easily within my top three movies of all time. It's probably between number two and number one, in competition with The Dark Knight. This movie doesn't feel like a movie. Time flew by while watching it, I was absolutely immersed in the world as soon as Andy arrived at Shawshank. The first part was a little slow, but after that it became incredible. Morgan Freeman's narration as Red really adds a lot to the story. It gets you completely immersed within the minds of the characters. The whole time, I was so interested in the characters, and the drama all built up so perfectly by the end I was genuinely disappointed that the movie was over.I think the thing that really sets Shawshank apart is that it takes its time. The movie is not afraid to go down rabbit trails and twist and turn around. The Brooks story has been praised to death, but it really deserves it all. Showcasing how a prison can institutionalize people is done so well through Brooks, and it makes me sad to say sequences like this would be left on the cutting room floor by most studios nowadays. The movie also spends time developing Tommy and showing his lessons with Andy, only for him to be murdered by the Warden and Captain Hadley. The Warden is also done really well, and I don't want to waste my time breaking his character down, there are countless essays describing the symbolism and plentiful Biblical references through his character. But, in the end, all of these sequences pay off in an extremely rewarding way, as they take our characters through the journeys they need to get to the end.Let me tell you, I have never felt the same surge of emotion from any movie as how I felt when Andy finally broke free and thrusts his arms wide open to the thundering rain. Every muscle in my body told me to get up and celebrate with him, and my heart was beating out of my chest. That is by far one of the greatest scenes ever crafted. The score swells up in this incredible surge of music that matches the swell of emotions within you. That was definitely the most satisfying moment from any movie I've ever seen.I think this scene touches with you on such an intimate level because it represents everything about the human spirit. While watching the movie, you don't think it's a very bright and happy story, and it isn't, but by the end you realize the whole movie was about hope and the human spirit. I think this is all aided wonderfully by how well-done the gloomy scenes are. I have never felt a more empty sense within me as I sat on my couch, jaw dropped to the floor, watching the fat prisoner get brutally beaten on his first night. There are some movies out there that have an R rating that doesn't feel needed. It has gritty violence that serves no purpose, but in The Shawshank Redemption that R rating is required for the story to be told. It simply wouldn't work without those scenes, including all the times Andy gets beaten by the Sisters.And of course, the whole story is enhanced even further as it's told from Red's point of view. As I said earlier, his narration gives this sense of intimacy between the viewer and the character, to the point where I completely forgot I was watching a movie. Even a movie that I have loved and adored for my entire life, such as The Dark Knight, simply can not deliver the experience that The Shawshank Redemption did. When I'm watching The Dark Knight, I know I'm watching a movie, however good it may be. This may be because of how many times I've seen something like The Dark Knight, and the fact that I just watched Shawshank for the first time. And to be honest, I don't plan to rewatch this movie any time in the foreseeable future. I'm quite scared that on a rewatch it won't be the same, and I don't want to diminish this masterpiece at all. But, getting back to the point of Red's narration, I think it's especially useful at the end of the movie. It really sets us to believe that Andy killed himself, and with what happened with Brooks earlier in the movie it totally works out. Once Red gets out of prison, his narration brings us into the same mindset of being institutionalized, but this time he has something to hope for. By this point in the movie, you start to realize that hope was the theme. This ending beautifully shows how far hope and the power of the human spirit can take you.Overall, I absolutely loved this film. It made me feel emotions that I haven't felt in a long time. I loved it on such a deep level that barely any other movie can reach. It's crafted in such a masterful way with the phenomenal cinematography, story, dialogue, characters, performances, score, and of course the set of Shawshank Prison itself.",10
"This movie is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella titled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is truly a masterpiece with the perfect casting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The lessons you learn, the emotions that were touched, the friendships that were made and overall, the redemption that every character got in their own way is what made this movie special. This movie teaches you about hope and institutionalization which means being stuck in one place for so long that it's all you ever know. It shows the darkness about being in prison. In conclusion, this movie is a 10/10. Hands down one of the greatest movies ever and I'll definitely rewatch it in the future.",10
"The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.""",7
"When I first saw this movie in 1994, before the hype, I thought it was a passable flick; nothing special and certainly in keeping with the usual schmaltz expected from any non-horror Stephen King work. In fact, with the exception of Morgan Freeman's excellent performance, I found it imminently forgettable. Then, lo, came the Academy Awards with a surprising nomination for Best Picture. Then, even worse, came the belated hype from its legion of fans. I could not understand this adoration of a movie that was as sugar-coated as that other saccharine movie of 94, Forrest Gump. Worse than Gump's unpalatable cuteness, however, was Shawshank's genre clichés: the rape scene, the prisoner's pet, etc. Had no-one seen Escape From Alcatraz or Birdman of Alcatraz? For me, Shawshank is possibly the most overrated film ever made, a fact emphasised by its place at No. 2 in the IMDb top 250.",10
"I can't believe I waited 11 years to see this film. I often saw commercials advertising the film on TNT, but never had enough interest to sit and watch until I bought the movie for my fiancée. I'm so glad I finally got to see this film. This is easily one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't believe the outstanding job done by all of the actors. I've seen very few scripts on the level of this one, but have never seen so many strong performances from the entire cast.Morgan Freeman is incredible as Red and narrates the action better than any other voice-over I've ever heard. I was very surprised with Tim Robbins. For some reason I still thought of him as Nuke Laloosh and never dreamed he had this kind of acting ability. The story is incredible and the dialogue keeps the entire film rolling. Two and a half hours go by like nothing. I also have to applaud William Sadler, who showed great versatility (watch Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey or Die Hard 2 to see what I mean). The film is intriguing as well as inspiring at the same time. I found myself inwardly cheering for Andy to escape from Shawshank and was even happy when he is shown emerging from the sewer tunnel. His reunion with Red is almost tearjerking. The movie managed to have a happy ending without it seeming to be another unrealistic Hollywood Ending.This film is definitely a must-see. I have seen Braveheart, and though I thought it was fantastic it doesn't come anywhere near the power of Shawshank Redemption. I doubt another cast ensemble of incredible acting talent will ever match this one. Easily a 10 on the IMDb.com scale.",10
Masterpiece.One of the best if not the best movie ever made.Wish i have the chance to watch it for 1st time again.A top 3 movie with no doubt.,10
"The Best inspirational movie. HOPE is a good thing and it's the best thing. ""HOPE""",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an exciting and very emotional excursion. It is the best ""jail"" movie ever made, for sure. There's suspense, surprises, and more, but it's true greatness is in it's show of the human spirit triumphing over impossible odds. With a pair of great actors and a very nice script, The Shawshank Redemption winds up getting a 10/10 from me.",10
"Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free.",9
"It's a great moive and it very famous
No feeling boring during seeing this shiw",10
"Cannot see why this film is rated so highly.  Sure, its watchable and nicely inoffensive, but its not really about much, and nothing really happens. Just a film about a bloke going to prison.  Somewhere along the line I think I must have missed something, because I can think of at least a hundred better films.  Saying that, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are flawless, though the latter's best film will always be the Hudsucker Proxy.  (Which incidentally is a better film.)",1
"Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free. Some people's wings are so bright that even the darkest prison in the world cannot encircle them for a long time. This film tells a simple story, a redemption, in exchange for freedom. Besides the belief drive him to do so. This film is moving, it also makes many people grow up.",10
"There are great movies & then there's The Shawshank Redemption. It's timeless & it has filled me with hope many times when I was down. Pure magic, won't write more as everything has already been written many times by many.",2
Nice movie...............................................................................................,10
"The best movie I have ever seen. The best movie I have ever seen, a story full of ups and downs and stress that constantly encourages you to watch.",6
It is perfection the story and everything else like you have no idea andy is gonna escape until hes not in his cell its a beautiful masterpiece of love and freindship and he is innocent the whole time,1
"Whilst Rita Hayworth's shawshank redemption was in my opinion your standard run of the mill novella, The film doesn't just do it justice but it almost destroys Stephen kings novella. The way the film is set up and turns out is amazing, the character arc of Andy Duffrane and how he is portrayed throughout the movie is amazing and shows the way not only does shawshank prison effect Duffrane but how it also effects the prisoners. The scene in where Duffrane plays music to the prison on the record player, really shows how restricted the prisoners are and how prison life has really effected them. And it also shows the characters/ prisoners appreciation of what Andy Duffrane did and I love how it shows the consequences of his actions. For me this is one of the best scenes in a movie ever. I also think the foreshadowing of Andy dufrane and him digging out with the rock hammer was genius and the end reveal of the rock falling through the poster was brilliant. Not to mention the brilliant narrating of Morgan Freeman which makes the film that much better than it already is",10
The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely terrific movie that shows why Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two of the finest actors alive today.  I predict years from now Shawshank will be held up as a true American classic. This is a flawless film.  My one regret is that I never saw this on the big screen.  (I think the odd name 'Shawshank Redemption' and the fact that it was a Stephen King story kept me away initially [thank goodness for cable TV])  I urge anyone who reads this to please see this movie.  It is the best film I have ever seen about life and hope.,10
"L have nothing to say.it's a story about hope.and it's use montage technique,a deep suspense.lt tru that everyone love it",10
Hope is a good thing never give up hope. Hope can you free.,10
"Probably the best thing in this movie is the message of never loosing hope. Andy(Dufrane) didn't knew where the hole could end, how long would it take to dig ths hole. He could have been caught at any moment, but he never lost hope...
Hope is what encouraged him to dig the hole with a rockhammer which Red (Morgan Freeman) predicted would take a man 600 years. Hope is what had let him crawl throug a 500 yards long sewer tunnel which no other inmate of the prison thought of.",4
Perfection! 10 is to little for this movie. This is MASTERPIECE! People have no reason not give this movie a ten!,10
"Just loved this movie, every characters and acting are phenomenal.",10
"This movie is full of suspension, drama, excitement, knowledge, etc, .
I loved this movie, previously before watching this movie i thought that how prisoners go and how they feel.
Know i understand they all are innocent 😇.",10
One of the best movies .It give us an inspiring message that one should never give up in his/her life.,10
This movie told us the value of patience. Definately recommended.,5
"What can i say that already hasn't been said? Nothing. It's amazing, amazing characters and iconic lines and scenes. And when it ended i just sat there with a big smile on my face for 10 minutes. Watch it.",10
"Yes this is simply a magnificent piece of work which remains powerful and moving and probably always will.It's been 14 years but who can forget such a masterpiece.This is a movie about how strong the human faith and spirit can be.Even in the most difficult moments we have to remain strong and believe in justice.This is what Shawshank is all about.I have never read the Steven King novel but he definitely should be proud that a director such as Frank Darabont has the passion and desire in making a powerful and faithful adaptation to King's work.A moving film with superb performances from all the actors but the real credit goes to Tim Robbins as the wrongfully accused Andy Dufresne whose spirit and will help him find freedom and Morgan Freeman as Ellis 'Red' Redding who serves a life-long sentence but hopes he can be freed from guilt.Throughout the movie we witness much suffering,injustice and sorrow but that's what makes the characters so pleasant and worth sympathizing for.Andy's desire to become a free man again is truly a magical but also difficult adventure.But he never loses his hope and that is what helps him succeed.The final scene when Andy and Ellis meet each other outside the steel cage prison is phenomenal and touching.It is a real shame that a movie so great didn't win a single Oscar although it had 7 nominations.А real unfairness cause this movie is indeed better than Forrest Gump.In conclusion I'll just say that Shawshank is a timeless masterpiece and deserves to be in the top 10 greatest films of all time.",10
Nice Movie. Love it and its awesome. I give 9 stars for this movie because it touched my heart.,10
"This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the ""standard"" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.",10
"No wonder the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. Can I say that before? Not much, it's a story, acting, foundation, but how this movie makes you feel. Sometimes you see a movie, and after a few days you can't remember it, this movie falls in love with you, and once you see it, you will never forget it.Friendship, hope, and the ultimate story of life and overcoming adversity.I understand why so many people classify it as the best movie of all time, it's not mine, but I got it. If you haven't seen it or haven't seen it in a while, you should see it, it's amazing. 10/10.",7
The best movie I have ever seen in my entire life. This will be a movie that will live on through history.,10
Absolutely incredible. This movie is a masterpiece and i will keep on watching it till the end of time.,10
"I don't dislike this movie, I think it's fine. Certainly it's not number 1, not even top 100. The movie becomes pretty stale mid way through and let's be honest there's absolutely nothing original about it.What I dislike most about this movie is the typically boring people who say it's their favourite for no other reason other than it's what they think people want to hear. Thus making them appear less boring.1 star because it needs knocking down a peg or 5.",10
"This is one of the best movies about ""friendship"" I've ever seen, also one of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redford's ""CASTLE"". Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish this couple come together for another movie, the kind of it is not important I'm sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his, normally he prefers to play in films like ""Seven"",""Kiss the girls"",""Along came a spider"",... but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...",9
"The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250.",6
"I did not see a ""goof"" submission area, so I feel compelled to comment on this movie's fatal flaws.Andy's cell was consistently laid out even right up to the night of his escape as he sat on his bed staring at the Rachel Welch poster. There in lies the flaw. If Andy crawled through his snug tunnel as depicted, with his clothes in tow, how did he get that poster to lay so flat to where it even appeared to be glued to the wall? It was so flat that even the Warden's commotion (rock throwing) in an open-air cell never moved that poster once. Given that, what about the sanitation pipe area that was equally open and subject to drafts and air movements, which would have easily moved the poster. Nailing, tacking, Velcro, and taping are out too. Even if he had tried to exit feet first he would have had to move some furniture, given the height of the tunnel's access off the ground. The guard found nothing unusual in the cell, as if Andy had vanished into thin air!The sanitary pipe leaves a lot to be desired as well. A thick-walled pipe of that diameter would need to be saw-cut in two places and have the section removed in order to allow enough room for Andy's body to fit. Armed with only a rock it would have taken Andy another year to get through the pipe. The director would have been better off installing a manhole access.Last but not least, the wool suit Andy wears in the bank looks spectacular for being crumpled up in a plastic bag only hours before the bank opened. Given the location of his rain soaked prison clothes and the time of day after a 500 yard crawl, Andy would have hastily changed in the rain and that suit would have been ruined. Unless he was packing a London Fog topcoat with him he would have had to make a visit to a dry cleaner and had a two-day wait on his clothes at best. I wish he would pack for me on my trips!""Redemption"" is a good movie, but not a great one.",1
"This is the best drama that I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman was beyond amazing, and was one of my favorite aspects of the movie. The story was perfect. I genuinely cannot think of a single critique of this movie. I advise you to drop whatever you are doing and watch this now!",10
"I hadn't seen this film until today and I never would have rented it if I hadn't seen that it was so high up on the top 250. It wouldn't have been a great loss. It's a pretty good movie, but a bit sappy for my taste. Gives you lots of warm feelings inside about persistence through adversity, hope, friendship and all that good stuff. If you're into that, it is very well put together and it features some good acting and a beautiful score. Oh, and -- this could be considered a SPOILER given that it's a prison movie -- the ending is so nice and so predictable and so cute and so corny, it just hurts. Art, it is not.",9
"Absolutely mind-blowing movie. Great script, direction and acting!",7
"Very good performances from Freeman and Robbins. Good writing.  The best move ever?  Nope.  I gave it a 8 out of 10.As a libertarian, my own feelings about freedom, power, and corruption are apparently quite a bit stronger than either Darabont or Stephen King.",10
"Best movie ever? Not even close. This is good movie, but there are 1000 good movies. Very few Great movies, and this certainly isn't great.Like others have pointed out, way overrated.Don't need to review it, as so many have already done. But I wanted to add another voice to the small group of people that acknowledge that it is getting way too much praise.This doesn't even come close to both Godfather films.",10
"This is not just a Prison film epic it is more than that - I feel its understated calling it a Masterpiece but it truly is. Rarely has a film stayed as long as it has at the top of the IMBD tree but there has been nothing since to compare. I have seen it a few times now and as I grow older it still feels as fresh watching again as it did the first time, only this time the way in which scenes are weaved together makes it even more enjoyable you watch and witness the characters grow and the story become more believable. How Prison would institutionalise and dehumanise a person and how that the main Character Andy Dufrane overcomes all this and brings hope - Its a masterpiece because you cannot watch it and feel for each character and see Red's redemption and come away feeling invigorated for the experience. The tarring of the roof, Brooks suicide the p\role hearings for Red and the most important part Hope - it truly inspires you feel that get busy living or get busy dying is such a powerful message in the end,.",10
I can watch this movie over and over.. Great work!!,10
"Can't believe it didn't win anything... Morgan Freeman was suoerb. He and Tim Robbins should win an award... and yes. This is how movie should be made. It touches your soul, make you feel good and grateful.",10
"When Shawshank begins, for about the first two minutes it seems nothing more than a made-for-TV movie. However, as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. Yet how can a film that contains rape, beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end? Frank Darabont manages to do this so well. The Green Mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending, but not like this does. I just love the way it follows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How touching that was to see an old man, let out of prison but without routine. He belonged in prison, not in the outside world.You forget at times that you are watching a movie. It sucks you in and moves you. If you haven't seen Shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. But don't worry - you're not beyond redemption! Watch it!",10
"Towards the end, dealing with Freeman's loneliness, I felt how he was feeling. These are believable criminals. People say these guys are too nice to be hard-core criminals, but people make mistakes. The guys' mistakes were on a big-time scale. One line will remain with me forever : Get busy livin, or get busy dying.Well, Get busy watching or get busy goin';",10
"This is such a good movie! Excellent screenplay and directing. And the casting is fantastic; everyone just fit their part like a hand in glove. The whole story flows smoothly that you forget it's all make-believe.I told one of my friends many times to watch this film and it took her years before she actually did. Once finished she said, ""What took me so long? This movie is soooo good!"".",8
When you watching this movie you need that the keep your mind claim and relex yourself . And at the end movie teaches you that your plans never fail when you execute your plans with your 150% of 💯% that make you success in your life and your dreams come true.,10
"A very deep, very powerful actor, a very beautiful and engaging film that you don't tap into, and you enjoy it minute by minute, I advise you to take a pen and pen with you when you see this video to write down the tips that will teach you to use it later in your life. At the end of the film, you'll feel a real sense of freedom, and you'll feel all the sadness and sorrow you saw in the film, as if none had happened. To put it this way, it's all over. I strongly suggest it.",10
"This film was totally amazing and is my favourite film of all time. This film humanizes the characters in prison which something we don't see in many Hollywood films as they dehumanize the prison characters. Also, it depicts the cruelt of prison very well and all the characters in this movie were amazing! Even the side characters were very engaging to watch. I actually tested up at the end of this movie. I strongly recommend this film to you if you haven't watched it yet",6
"Stephen King's stories usually do not translate well to movies (Carrie, The Running Man), but occasionally, a King story is done right (Shining, Stand By Me).  This movie is probably the best of the group.  It's a brilliant story matched with a brilliant screenplay.  The cast was great from the professionals (Robbins, Freeman) to the relatively unknown actors.  This movie is about a man's will to survive even when his future looks the darkest.  One of my all time favorite movies.",10
"I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies. There is nothing new in this film and there isn't anything in it that makes it special. Wake up people! Quote Bill Hicks ""Piece of Sh*t"".OK I'll give it that there isn't anything to complain about the acting or directing, etc. But this entire movie seems to be a compromise. I also think that the success of this film is based on the ""least worst principle"" and that makes it bad.I'm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music. All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations. Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is? I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference.",10
"when i began to watch this movie,i just said to myself,this should be the best i ever saw in my life,judging the IMDb rating and Kinopoisk rating!and it really haven't disappointed me! i learned,that if you want something so much,and the wish to achieve a thing or to get something is bigger and greater than anything else,this will obviously happen! there is nothing more important than to believe in yourself,to believe in justness, in the right choice of destiny! there are things that i disliked in the movie,but those awesome moments just overcome all the misses! I'm gonna watch it again...cause there still remain a lot of meanings and messages that i must follow! Hope is the best thing that can ever happen to you! never loose it!",10
"I'm not saying that Shawshank Redemption is a bad movie, in some ways it's perfect. The storytelling is seamless and unquestionable, the characters are bright and strong. Villains with motivation. Heroes are not idiots. Events are justified by circumstances that push the heroes to independent actions. But my God, there are so many films that are so many times more worth your time and emotional energy that Shawshank Redemption is a quiet and meditative movie that is hard to watch at times. It's impossible for me personally to worry about characters that look so fake and created specifically for this story. They cannot be imagined in other circumstances, outside the picture. The lack of deep meanings and the possibility of different interpretations of the characters and what is happening is annoying. In general, he may just not be my type, but in the end it's just one of the opinions.",10
"I think its obvious to anyone that has seen this movie that its quite possibly the best film ever. Its just perfect, iv watched it so many times but its gets better every time, in fact the last time i watched it, it brought a tear to my eye just as it finished. And i know, that sounds quite sad but, anyone who has seen film and understands the sheer quality of its brilliance! Don't get me wrong, there are other brilliant films but this this one stands out amongst all others, if you haven't seen this movie then i strongly advise that you make it your #1 priority.11/10",10
"I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it was about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes it is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I abnormal???????? I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that. I'm sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever, but I don't.",10
"I love this film to bits, even though it can be hard to watch.",9
This is an amazing movie. I can watch it time and time and time again,10
"It's boring, i don't care about the characters. Overrated to madness. The movie could have been way darker, feels like a disney adventure.Great acting, ok story.",6
"This movie when i see, i forget myself totally, very fine art, very creative, good acting performed by all characters. Special to the hero of the movie.",4
"I liked it not bad, but in some places it was kind of boring for me, but in general I was satisfied with this film, well done, they shot well, only of course I fell asleep at the end, but there's nothing to worry about) I liked it not bad, but in some places it was kind of boring for me, but in general I was satisfied with this film, well done, they shot well, only of course I fell asleep at the end, but there's nothing to worry about)I liked it not bad, but in some places it was kind of boring for me, but in general I was satisfied with this film, well done, they shot well, only of course I fell asleep at the end, but there's nothing to worry about)",10
"Thought provoking and emotional, Shawshank Redemption remains as one of the greatest movies to grace the big screen and will always have a special place in my heart and mind.",8
"The movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but to be honest, the movie is also greatly overrated in many ways. I believe that the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of popularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous struggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense, and locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he keeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow inmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped where you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the thing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this aspect, and i understand it. But even though this movie, in my opinion does not have any flaws, it is still not perfect, and i do not think that it is the best, not flawed feature film ever made.",8
"Frank Darabont has created a good film about the misuse of criminal justice system and the obnoxious corruption in prisons.He has done this by showing an insider's view of a penitentiary from the perspective of its inmates.Although Tim Robbins has a good role in this film as Andy,he is surpassed by Red played by Morgan Freeman.He is at the summit of his acting prowess as everything is written on his face.There is no other actor in Hollywood or elsewhere who could have done this role of Red with absolute conviction as Morgan Freeman. Shawshank Redeption tells us in clear terms that in prisons it is the rule of everyman for himself but sometimes there are exceptions. Feelings of suffering,sadness,trust,joy,companionship occur which give the prisoners the hope to carry on.It is nice that there is not much focus on feminine characters as they did not have anything that could have justified their presence.",10
"This movie takes you through all kinds of emotions. It's an absolute classic. And with the two wonderful protagonist actors, it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've watched it 3 or 4 times and never gets boring.",10
"I cant describe how amazing this movie is, but i dont have to because almost everyone saw it and if you havent... what are you waiting for? Probably the best movie on earth",8
"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing.",10
"Andy has a better place is that he did not give up all the thinking in his outside life, he was not convinced by the institutionalized life in prison. In other words, he still insisted on his own heart and did not lose himself. This is the most important point of life. If you don't know why you are alive, it can only be a walking body, not an emotional person.",1
"This film, if it isn't one of the greatest of all time, at least I can say it is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This is a must-recommend, because to be honest, this is one of the many movies a movie lover must see before they die. It is not just a great film, but a great experience. And it is quite the experience! Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his career in this film. I give props to the director for making him narrate the film as well. He is just that great. Tim Robbins give a very underrated performance in this film. Freeman stole the show, but there was a certain subtlety of Robbins' that can't go without being recognized. Either way, both these men give their full effort into this film. There is a great atmosphere around this film as well, it's a subtle tone, as this is a subtle, (But great) film, but it changes when it needs to change, and it knows exactly when. As a matter-of-fact, what makes this movie great is that it knows exactly when it needs to do something powerful, thoughtful or sentimental, and to be honest as a moviegoer, that is all I can ask for.",10
"I wait for the day when this film is no longer in the top 200 of IMDb, as it deserves.  Please, if any film was passed over in favor of Gump at the 1995 Oscars--it was the best film of the nineties--PULP FICTION.",9
"I had heard about the movie since it first came out, but somehow, I never got around to watching it. Now, I super-glad that I watched it. It is an utterly fantastic movie, to the max. The movie contains almost every human emotion that there is, and overall, it is a totally wonderful character study, as well. There is marvelous writing, and a totally well thought-out plot, and the acting talent throughout is on an almost otherworldly level. It is a movie that captured my attention from the very beginning, keeping me totally engaged throughout for the entire duration of the film. All said, this is yet another movie that I truly wish that I could give more than ten stars, because it truly deserves many, many stars.",9
"So i watched this film maybe 10 times Russian version, 5 original English. Read both book versions. It's beautiful story! When i have watched this film first time, after started to follow the career of the actor Morgan Freeman. He is a great actor. I give the film 10 stars",7
"I was inflicted The Shawshank Redemption in a school trip coach, where a shy girl handed the tape to the headteacher : ""Sir please sir ! Can we watch it ?"". And we did, gosh, we did.  And heard it as well. Spoilers ahead ! A very noisy film - overblown, cheesy, sappy, with ugly slow-motions to make you understand that, hurray, at last the characters are free (and so was I, mercifully), and the bad ones have been punished (and so was I, and so was I...) Yes, at last that does make sense... Next the students asked for Meet the parents - and - would you believe it ? Ben Stiller WAS a relief. Since that moment I've always wanted to watch Zoolander.",9
Well there's not much you can say about this movie except that it is the Best movie of all time and no other Movie will top this great Great movie If you have not seen it sit back clear your mind and watch it and make sure you are not bothered while watching it that way you can fully understand the film and its purpose.So out of a 1-10 scale I give it a 10+++++++ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT RENT IT!!!!!!!!,10
"I'm not sure Shawshank Redemption deserves to be considered the best film of all-time, personally I'm not sure I would even have it in the top 50. Regardless, this is still a majestic and thoroughly entertaining movie with an unforgettable finale. The lead performances from both Robbins and Freeman are career-defining and help make the film so memorable.",10
This movie proves its worth of having top spot on IMDb list.It is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.Great acting displayed by lead actors specially Morgan freeman.Truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.Dialouges of this film are well written. You will miss something if HAVE not watch it. Highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.I will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.Like godfather.Godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.,6
"This film is a masterpiece and clearly deserved
10/10",10
"This is a moving story about a remarkable man who gets convicted of a crime he didn't do. Despite the odds being stacked against him (a fellow inmate who could help him get a new trial gets killed by the prison warden), and spending a lot of time in solitary confinement, he pulls off the most brilliant prison break imaginable. The plot is deeply moving and raises many interesting questions, like what does life after prison look like? What happens if someone is convicted of a crime they didn't do? How do you bring corrupt authoritative figures to justice if you're not in a position of power? I like a movie that makes you think. They don't make movies like that anymore. I have a friend in prison and she says everyone in there knows it, it's a classic. I definitely recommend watching the movie - it has a great cast and good message. You won't be disappointed.",10
"I watched this film several times and I am fascinated with it today as I was then when I watched it. Everything is top of the line. Acting, plot, camera, everything.Plot involving jail in 1940s is really an interesting plot and characters are really colorful. I think that was one of the films when Morgan Freeman came to fame. Other actors are fantastic too. This story is timeless and it will probably be watched many times over and over again by many people in the future.However, I am not sure that it deserves to be number one on IMDb top 250 films of all times. I would put Schindler*s list there rather then this film. But that is just me.",10
"What a complete masterpiece this film is, from the first line spoken to the zoom-out in the end. The actors are all great, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do outstanding performances. This is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasn't seen it there's only one thing I can say: Please do! You won't be disappointed.",5
It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Out of my top 5 worst movies this would be in at least the top 3 movies I hate. It is just so boring and everytime I turn on TNN or something it is on! By far one of the worst movies ever!,9
"Let me just say that I liked the movie. I love Freeman, I respect Robbins. Reading King. But the review is red. I explain:In the IMDB list (as well as on Kinopoisk), films often float, sometimes climbing to second place in the list, and then dropping to one hundred and ninety-third, etc. The picture is changing. But one thing remains the same: The Shawshank Redemption comes first.The site has almost the entire filmography of mankind, but this story remains the best. Yes, the story is good, as is the setting of the film. But is this the best thing that the world has created in more than a century of work? Is that what worries people? The most pressing? Deeper than 'Forrest Gump'? More classic than the tacitly declared must see 'Titanic'?",10
"An UNDER-RATED movie?? Gimme a break! This is one of the most over-rated movies on IMDB! 8.7, what a joke! This movie is boring, plain and simple. You want to watch a movie 5 times so that you can put the pieces together and finally get it, fine. I'd rather watch a movie that was actually more entertaining than a jigsaw puzzle.",7
"This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work. The direction of it is exquisite (and gives much to Tim Robbins character, I know he is a good actor, but the direction gives so much more to him).  The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite (thanks to Stephen King).  I have seen many greats, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now....etc. This movie is fantastic, and the fact it didnt' win (or even get nominated) for an Oscar is the reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars anymore. This movie is fantastic, and an artistic triumph. I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick.",10
"The first time I watched this film I was on a coach heading to the french Alps in year 8 of school. I loved it from the first moment. A few weeks later when I discovered the title of the film I went out and brought it, (or more correctly had it brought as I wasn't old enough). It remains one of my favourite films in my collection.Why do I think this is one of the best films ever, it comes down to the telling of a great story, in a great way, by great actors. From the moment the film begins your sucked in, the audience is made to connect with the events we see on screen thanks to the soulful voice of the great Morgan Freeman, he has the ability to help us relate with events and almost forget we are watching a film, but instead listening to a story from a much loved grandparent. When he speaks the audience definitely listens.However Morgan is by no means the star. The less well known but equally talented Tim Robbins, his performance of Andy Dufresne, is in my opinion one of the all time greats. The way in which the character attempts to retain dignity and his humanity, instead of being twisted into the archetypal convict is reason enough for this film to be in the IMDb top 250. The way at which Dufresne strives to improve his and the other convicts leaves you with a taste on the honourably of the character, or his rebellious acts toward the Warden just to provide the inmates with a piece of music is a scene which you remember just because of its shear brilliance. Which reminds me big thanks to Steven King for writing the book this film was based on, you did good, like you normally do.No one could review this film without mentioning James Whiymore who plays the tragic figure of Brookes, the old lovable inmate. The sad tale of the man who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is the emotional heart of the film, I feel sad every time I watch it. James Whitmore was truly a great actor, this film proves it. Th story never gets tedious no matter how many time you watch it, and if its your first time watching be set for a treat.The best thing I can say about this film is watch it, and the only problem you'll have is trying to get across to your friends exactly why the need to see this great piece of cinema",10
The Movie is all about living in Earth Planet and how to Survive in Big cities!I found it awesome and for sure will watch it every few months with Friends and Pets!,10
Not so nice and boring. They have to get better with their movies,6
"I really recommend this MP. I thank all the casting, directors, producers, writers and other staff for crafting this unforgettable movie.
I give 10/10 for leaving a smile on my face at the end and joy in my heart.
Thank you!",10
"Me encanto la historia la recomiendo ver, cuenta una gran historia.",10
"Amazing, must watch for everyone! Simple but touching.",10
"...but there is no hope in the Oscars when this masterpiece claims none of them.
Directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this Stephen King adaptation displays the familiar themes of hope, friendship, and injustice. And it doesn't just show us these themes but rather puts us through them ourselves as we see our protagonist Andy Dufresne , wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover, be cast into the ruthless Shawshank Prison with two lifetime sentences. Andy, however, still has hope. We watch as he becomes fast friends with his fellow inmates, most notably Morgan Freeman's 'Red' Redding and slowly, over the course of 20 years, become an important part of prison life, not only for his fellow prison mates, but also the two faced Warden. Andy suffers humiliation, heartbreak, and setbacks throughout his time at Shawshank, but by the end of the film his undying hope carries him through the gates of Shawshank and into freedom.",8
"I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film is.You've probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of 'IMDB's top 250', or maybe you've heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be half-decent. I can assure you this will live up to your expectations. The acting, the plot, the setting, the cast, the directing, the messages and symbols, the acting again (deserves another mention) is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting. Please don't waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because, I can assure you, you can. Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online - I really don't care - just make sure you watch this film before anything else. As an 18-year-old guy, I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. Go watch it! Now!",10
"It makes you feel stuff. This movie makes you feel emotion. It's awesome, a classic, and really not that overrated",9
"""Redemption by Shawshank"" turns life into a cruel choice. Shawshank's redemption is something we have to remember repeatedly in our simple lives. Believing in yourself, not giving up hope, giving up effort, and waiting patiently for your own glory in life, is Shawshank's redemption.",6
"This is a classic about hope. Hope is not in prison. The owner, gong'an Di, was misunderstood and imprisoned. Relying on his inner firmness, he saved his life with wisdom and hope, saved the prison with a small hammer, and sowed the seeds of hope into everyone's heart.",8
Yes! it's absolutely true.Recently I had gone to a DVD shop. I found this movie and bought it. SHAWSANK REDEMPTION is a never before never again movie. One man is accused by murder case that he did not do that. after he becomes a prisoner. in that prison another man finds him and they becomes close friends. but that man never loses his hope to be a free man. he makes his all prison life to find a solution to live as free man in the world and he does some things to ensure this to come true. then he finds and makes his life absolutely free. This amazing movie was directed by frank darabont with original story by stepen king. afterwards this movie was nominated for seven Oscars including best picture. but won nothing. I don't hesitate to say it's a evergreen movie all time in everyone's life.,9
"A story about friendship and hope. Every minute of this movie will keep you intrigued and wanting more, a movie you will never want to finish. There are two movies to me that are perfect 10's, Goodfellas and Shawshank Redemption. Enjoy.",9
"I have to say that it was just fine, but not as great as some are making it to be.",10
"In the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday afternoon I knew it was my favorite.  I was captured instantly by how the story unfolded.  You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't know if thats spelled correctly).  The way he speaks with thought and hope, the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks.  Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail.  They couldn't have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman.  His voice is perfect for the narration of the film.  Every card played by this movie was an ace.  From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not forget the music.  I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I think it deserves it.",9
"I'll keep this short and sweet. I am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. However, I didn't think I would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. I have to honestly say that I was impressed by the directing, acting and overall story. This is a great move! You should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This story has structure, purpose and meaning. Though, if you can't sit still then don't bother. However, I do think it's time we get some culture back in our lives.",9
"This movie doesn't deserve a 10, it deserves a 11...This is the best movie I ever saw, everything on the movie is great, the story, the acting, the message, just everything. I spoke with so many people that saw this movie, and everyone of them said that The Shawshak Redemption is a truly masterpiece.If someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you haven't yet, because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. It is the best rated movie (9.2) and when I see that rating Im just asking myself ""why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10??",9
"After I have seen this movie over a dozen times, in different phases of my life, I can help you by saying this is a milestone to have, not only as a movie fan, as well as a person to see, in this story, that hope is the last and first resource. More than twenty years after I saw this for the first time, I can still remember how I felt then and still share the same emotion now that I am a father and an adult with a consciousness of life. Yes, this is entertainment but also something to witness. Regards to everyone involved in the making of this touching masterpiece.",10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to very good actors star in this movie about Tim wrongfully accused and sent to prison where he befriends Morgan Freeman. I mean it was a good movie and a i liked it, it just didn't blow me away and I guess thats how I rate a movie from Good or Great, I like it don't get me wrong, its just i didn't get the same feeling i get from other great movies, it didn't have me thinking about the character, whats happening next, it wasn't riveting, it was kinda slow I guess just dragging from scene to scene. To be perfectly honest I would personally rank this movie at like an 8.1 - 8.2, I guess I just kinda figured that he would get out, and a movie like that where you can pretty much guess whats going to happen there is much to stay and watch, I didn't feel they would leave the movie with him in prison and thats pretty much what did it for me.I mean this is purely my opinion, I know some people who love this movie and they bring up their valid points, but right now I am sharing my point of view with everyone about this movie.",10
"This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is.",10
"I watched three times,every time i have different feelings .",10
"I watched this movie around a decade after its release. Back then, internet was not everywhere and probably imdb did not exist.I remember the movie.I did not like it, but it was not terrible either. It is a movie about the framing of an innocent,it is about all the bad things he went through and finally comes redemption. That's it pretty much. Do not expect a classic movie. I was not moved by the movie,I was not excited ,I did not have anything to contemplate. It was a simple story. It is not bad, but please don't tell me that this is the best movie ever made. This is absurd. I have watched so many movies in my life and I have watched masterpieces. I cannot believe people said this was the greatest movie. Do not have so high expectations if you want to watch it. You will end up disappointed.",10
"""A long road to freedom, and a soul of washing, an immortal motivational classic,"" hope ""follow the will of god sleep was hollowed out of the bible in inside pages, attached to the Andy tall body, near 500 yards of the sewer, in the end, the only dirty way took Andy to the beautiful new world.",10
Just watch it! if u watch this movie you r gonna get really strong lesson for this life ..,10
"I had a few questions at the end, but otherwise an amazing film that made me feel all the feelings. Loved the score and the acting was top notch. Couldn't say enough good things about it. Highly recommend.",10
One of the top movies i have ever watch! Must seen!,10
"Shawshank Redemption narrates a beautiful story of two prisoners bonding over the number of years. Their experiences in the prison and the chemistry between two (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) have been shot with terrific care.Editing and Screenplay of this movie are among the best in any movie you will see. The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently. Overall, this is the sort of movie you will remember for long time and a benchmark among the ""feel good"" movies. MUST WATCH.",10
"I saw this movie few years back.i was immature, i didn't get what this movie was offering True Meaning Of Friendship,Patience, to see every Perspective of turns whether its hard or not we face during our lifetime..
Really a strong movie must watch",10
An enduring piece of art that will change certain aspects of the way you think for the rest of your life. That's all.,10
This movie is the best of all times.All the actors are in their high limits of their performs.When you are watching the movie you just feel you are in that prison and living all these things like they suffered all the pains.And I need to say something about Morgan Freeman.His voice and his role is perfect in this movie. you are just watching out of breath during the movie.I don't know but maybe I watched this movie more than three and every time ı am finding new things that ı couldn't see before.Also the story is unique and different than other prison movies.I am describing in that way because before and after this film there are a lot of movies about prison life.To give this prison life emotions you need to find some specific things which would grab audiences' attention.,6
The shawshank redemption is probably the one of the best films ever depicted in cinematic form.  It is the most controversial and sad film I've ever seen; second is American history x.  I loved this film and I thought Tim Robbins was excellent and Morgan Freeman as well.  Let me just say to that everybody should see this film.  I give it 4/4,9
"Definitely NOT your ordinary Stephan King adaptation. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the few movies I've seen, where emotion and story are perfectly blended into one absolutely AMAZING story! You can feel the terror from Andy's trial, you can feel the happiness from the beer on the roof scene,the anger from scenes involving The Sisters, the shock when he learns that Tommy was killed, and the hope, joy and happiness gathered together when Andy escapes.The acting was amazing, the adaptations from the book were spot-on, this is the greatest adaptation I have ever seen. Of all the people in the world, I have never met one person who didn't enjoy it.If you haven't seen it; why are you sitting there? Go out and rent it and see for yourself, how amazing this film is!",7
"Good movie but 9 is too extreme, is certainly one of the masterpieces of cinema, but like many Hollywood movies there is some bad things, when the protagonist moves down the sewer pipe, in reality it would be caught bad. A very nice movie that you can refer to the way that each of us must do just to get out of certain problems. After all you put poor grades to great films, especially horror. Hardly comes out of jail in a tunnel of excrement, jail and violence and degradation but you can get out mainly in Italy. However great interpretation of Morgan Freeman, many sentences are historical and should keep in mind. In the movies there must be some humanity in this film there is too much violence",10
"Let's be honest, it's a fairly mediocre movie. Entertaining, I'll grant you, but profound? No way. Not much here in terms of innovative or even creative film-making either.Is it one of the most popular films of all time? Probably. At least of recent time.
Is it the greatest film ever made? Don't make me laugh.That said, I'm glad people can enjoy this movie. I won't watch it again, but I don't exactly regret it.",10
"The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. An absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. If you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead, nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. Everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. I have watched it for many times, at least ten times I guess. Now I hope I can download it and keep it and enjoy it once I have time. I used it to encourage people around me, for example, a girl friend who's suffering from the depression, a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet, and a friend who lost his job recently.",10
"Shawshank truly is the best-made standalone movie of all time.As much as I might like the extended Lord of the Rings trilogy more overall, as for singularly movies, nothing tops Shawshank.",10
"This is one of those dramas that will keep on tied till the end. It showed the beauty of a griping screenplay. Some films will give a spark from the first glance itself. This is one movie that takes you deeper the more you watch it. a very thin story line with superb acting. But if you just want to watch a good movie with social message and how to not lose hope, then go for it",1
I didn't have a single moment of boredom while watching this movie.When I think about this movie I wonder why.,9
"Well what can I say but, Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.",9
"In this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend.I really like this movie, because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I loved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to.I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.",9
"I can't think of any movie more monstrously overrated than The Shawshank Redemption. Giving it only one star may seem harsh but considering all the undeserved praise heaped on this mediocre and dull movie I think it's fair. I watched it on TV and it is good enough for some entertainment for a few hours if you're too tired to do anything else but that's about it. It is predictable and unimaginative: innocent guy (well we never learn if he is if I remember correctly but as he is such a nice fellow we're supposed to think so), sexually assaulted, escapes and there you have it and that's all there is to it. Of course Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are good actors but I can't think of anything more nice to say about this movie.",10
"Despite its status as a classic, The Shawshank Redemption is not quite a great film, argues Robbie Collin.",7
"If perfection had to be defined through a movie, this would be it
starting from the acting to direction to screenplay, everything, you name it and its here, done perfectly
its almost as if God personally guided the people making this movie :)",10
"This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top 250, let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time. It is rather dull, extraordinarily predictable, and filled with clichés. This is not even the best prison film, let alone #2 among all films! Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone? I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not disappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible audience. Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition.",9
"Wonderful touching story that will make you cry AND feel extremely good inside. STEVEN KING proves that he is one of the best story writers EVER.Superb acting by Freeman et al. Wonderful narrative, music, cinematorgraphy and backward looking story that escalates throughout the film.A work of genious, J",10
"all I can say about this is that it is by a clear mile one of the best films ever made! the story line was gripping and intriguing, there was never a single dull moment and i can honestly say that this film is definitely one that i can watch over and over again without being bored. the cast really brought the characters to life and it was just such an emotional roller-coaster. if you have never seen this film before then i definitely recommend that you watch it! watch it on your own or with friends and family it really doesn't matter because i can guarantee that everyone will love it and if they for some reason don't then they clearly have no taste",10
"There is nothing to criticize about this movie. It is made as subtle and touching a movie can be. It never goes into emotions more than necessary. The music, the story, the acting, everything is perfectly orchestrated. It is delicate and beautiful in all the sense of the term. It is such a shame that Morgan Freeman didn't got an award, it would have been well deserved. Stephen King wrote again a masterpiece, like the Green Mile, from the same author and the same film director. Frank Darabont execute this story more in a tone that reminds me ""Out of Africa"". The prison is a character by itself, all the actors including the secondary roles are just perfect. Watching this movie remains us the true meaning of hope, and that everything is possible. But what are you doing here? Rather than reading reviews, just buy it, rent it and see it. It is one kind of a unique movie that you will never forget.",10
Without question this is my all time favorite movie. Flawless!,5
"Okay so many people may be wondering why I hate such a ""beautiful work of literature"" or ""The best story ever told on screen"". Well there are too many reasons to list in my maximum of 1,000 words. So instead I will give a few obvious reasons on why I truly hate this movie. Being a teenager I enjoy movies like ""Mystic River"" and ""Donnie Darko"". You know psychological thrillers. Well this is nothing of the sort. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is what I classify as a Sleeping movie. The name says it all. You sleep while you watch it. It took me about a month to get through the whole entire movie. That is very sad considering the praise this movie received. I pray no one else ever has to go through the torture of watching this horrid movie.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie that should be seen by everyone at least once in their life. I am not one for re-watching movies or rereading books, but this movie is one of the few exceptions. I can recite more than half of the lines and it makes my day anytime that I see it is on (shout out to AMC for literally running marathons of it). It has a fulfilling plot that develops well and a great cast all around. To this day, it amazes me that it was not a box office hit.It's a movie that will make you laugh and cry, a movie that will break your heart one moment and the next you'll be pumping your fist in satisfaction. This is certainly a 10/10 in my books. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"".",6
"Let me start by stating that this is one of the most sad, poignant and beautiful films I've seen since Paranormal Entity. I feet that Tom Hanks' portrayal of a bored police officer was cutting edge at the time and has yet to be surpassed by any actor in any film since, excluding Shane Van Dyke's potentially career defining performance in Shane Van Dyke's Paranormal Entity (written by Shane Van Dyke). Michael Clarke Duncan's interpretation of the character John Cofey was banal to say the least, but I was more than compensated for this error in judgement with two deliciously witty comedy set pieces. One was where a rat got knocked out and one was where he forgot to put a sponge on his head. As an aside, I enjoyed the skit in which Michael Clarke Duncan refused to give Moon's Sam Rockwell a slice of bread and the bit where Tom Hanks couldn't take a wazz.In conclusion, I award this film 2 golden skulls. Half a star for the scene where the rat dies, and one star for Tim Robins crawling through a crapper. I am also awarding the film two golden skulls for the scene in which Tom Hanks bangs his wife after John Cofey heals him.Overall - 3 golden skulls (Paranormal Entity earned 9 golden skulls) cheers",10
This movie is a life changer. It can change the way of how you perceive the life one lives in this world. It really is a movie which helps you for redemption. It always provides motivation and hope no matter how many time i watch it. It really deserves it's first place in imdb.,6
"I cannot believe that it took me 17 years to see this movie and was it worth the wait well here's what the film is about.The story is about a young banker played by Tim Robbins who was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in Shawnshank prison where he meets a former crook named Reed played by the brilliant actor of our generation Morgan Freeman. The two become inseparable as they deal with prison life and the guards betting the HELL out of some of the prisoners; one got killed to death by the guard while the other hanged himself to death.Everyday they have to dig up holes and eating disgusting food, but will Andy(aka Robbins)ever get out of prison and did he really kill his wife and her lover in cold-blood?Bottom line is this; I'm 22 years of age a female who hates watching these kind of movies as there really not my cup of tea,I'm sort of a romantic/fantasy/cartoon/drama/weepie kind of chick and I hate watching violent movies,but this movie was really good;but seriously is it the best movie in the world? well for me its not in fact its all about dealing with prison life and the whole motto is get busy or die trying. Overall I did enjoy this movie but I wouldn't be watching it again. Once is enough for me.SO I'm giving it a 7.5/10",10
"Few movies allow you to feel as though youve been put on a riverboat in the middle of july as the suns going down, where you can see just how good you've really got life on the land.The movie is simply a symphony of finely tuned instruments allowing you to feel the pluck of every characters heart strings as they wash through their own version of corrections.Great movie!",10
"it remained in the laptop movie folder for one and half year.............. every time i started to watch it i felt bored for the 1st 15 minutes....eventually i started to watch it more than 15 minutes for the first time............... then the miracle happened.....i just finished watching this phenomenon in one sitting with nearly grasping my breadth full with emotions ushering in my veins and artery.......just on sentence requires to describe it """"""It is worthy to be in the 1st place of the top 250 over 20 years and so On,.......if you haven't seen it see it.if you haven't listened to it hear it.if u haven't felt it yet feel it.",10
Loved this mivue must see. This is a very interesting movie and a must see. Action packed and popcorn and chill.,10
Indeed... This is the best movie in history. An outclass script. And beautiful narration.,10
"Too sentimental, too pathetic, too slow, too conventionally made, and the voice over explaining everything ruins it completely, making it boring as hell. By far the most overrated film of all times.",10
Well directed & written. Each character is well played!,9
The Best Film in Top 250 is One of the Great Films I've ever Seen in this Masterpiece you can find a way for life crisis The Shawshank redemption is a film for Relaxing especially end of it when red came to Andy I Think this sense even better than red's Escape but why many of world people love the film? I Think everyone can enjoy it length of film is 142 mins maybe more for a film with no action sense but I think no one end of it but a question for me is why darabont can't make masterpieces like it and green mile rhythm of movie is an important thing for addressed in the Shawshank redemption rhythm don't tire you and characters are not superstars with more ability than a human Andy could find a way for escape because he was an innocent man and don't kill his wife and prison is a character in this film like green mile maybe you loved like or hate this movie but I am one of the fans of darabont's masterpiece,10
"The first time I saw the movie I was crazy about it .I did not want to speak to anyone nor do anything .I wanted to rise my arms and cry ---yes, just like what Andy did .It really inspires me greatly .I believe it is a terrific film because it includes all things a film should have. The plot , the characters,the director,the spirits are all top.So I want to see it for another time .Then I find out that I don't like the oaks which stands for power and strength .Why can't the letter just between two brisks. It's obvious the director wanna tell us something in a obvious way. But it's not serious,this is quite personal. I still know what I can get from this movie. The more I see it ,the more I get .I know Andy deserves the happy ending ,will he succeed in the real world?",5
"I have seen the movie for the first time. It's a wonderful film with excellent plot twists what gives a positive effect to the enjoying of the movie. Things are happening you don't expect and that's good for a movie. It's also a dark prison-film and i like that type of films. The voice of Morgan Freeman is also very nice, and intimidating. The IMDb-rating is very high. I think the movie deserves it, but i understand other people who are thinking that this movie is overrated. I think the reason why is that this movie has less haters then other movies like Pulp Fiction, and so on... .One point can be better: the characters doesn't become older when the movie progresses.But a well-deserved 10/10.",7
"Proof, along with _Delores Claiborne_ and _Stand by Me_ that Stephen King can spin a fine tale when he sets his mind to it. Even having read the book (this is one case where the movie is better), Robbins and Freeman's performances were so captivating that the ending still took me by surprise. Definitely one of the best.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption will go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time, If not the greatest movie ever.The films draws you in for the very first second and keeps your eyes glued to the screen until the very last second! Excellently written and the acting was a class above the rest!! Highly recommend",10
"If someone tells me to describe a real, entertaining movie - that would be it. 'Real' for the lack of SFX is a true bless when talking about ""The Shawshank Redemption"". I become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the SFX crew or the team responsible for the CGI effects. Film's purity emphasises the importance of the act. The actors are incredible; not a single minute could be considered a bad acting (well, at least I think so). 'Entertaining' for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. I am not a huge fan of Tim Robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. Mr. Freeman stays solid as usual in his act.",10
"The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen it... please do, otherwise you are missing something.",1
"It's not that the storyline is extremely complex or something which makes this film great. The characters and the acting is what makes this film extraoridinary. So this film is about a few fellas who are prisoners inside the prison. Their goal is to get free. The characters live on hope and that's why this film is so important, it's one of the best inspirational movies ever which shows that no matter how bad the situation is, you will still have always have hope. The ending of this film is pure work of art and beauty. Hell, the whole film is one of the best cinematic experiences ever.",7
"I just saw this movie yesterday and now I feel ridiculous for waiting so long.  It was really great and I am sorry it did not win any Oscars, because it deserved to win more than ""Forrest Gump"", in my opinion.  Tim Robbins actually played a likable guy and Morgan Freeman was perfection.
SPOILER ALERT!!!I cried when ""Red"" was given parole! I also should have known what was going to happen to Tommy Williams, but that caught me by surprise.
I do have one problem with the movie, but I got over it right away and did not diminish from the entire experience.  If Andy's cell was on an upper level, and in between other cells, where was this tunnel he built actually supposed to be? The ending was very cathartic, thank God.  After the brutality and injustice portrayed in the movie, we needed that. And the ending was very beautiful too.",7
"Stephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and love some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the characterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads to his books being long and slow some times but that's the part of it. This normally doesn't transfer well to cinema where everything is cut and compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and I was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it.The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories enhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to the end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the atmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you, it pulls at you and it lulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it, smiles with it and cries with it.I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a stage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are many great moments in the movie including the two stage ending, both stages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another great moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His dialogue delivery (the world went ahead and got itself in to one BIG DAMN hurry) and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly captured further ahead in the movie when Red facing similar circumstances confesses, ""Terrible thing to live in fear"" The same fear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in Buxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a letter. (Great acting and direction) This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it many times, enough to even forget the count are touched by it every time. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is impressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal hope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in Red.",10
"In this movie Morgan Freeman has delivered his greatest performance in his legendary career. Awesome right? but that's not all.Shawshank Redemption is without doubt the best movie of its decade and one of the best movies ever made. Killer plot, great directing, great cinematography, amazing acting and in the end you are left stunned, touched and you will fall in love with it. If you do not like this movie something is definitely wrong with you.This movie not winning any Oscar is simply disgraceful.In conclusion if you haven't watched this movie than you are missing a lot.",10
"I cannot believe that this movie has rec'd the accolades it has. I thought was mediocre at best and at worst saccharin, predictable, neatly cathartic and only mildly believable. I think that if it didn't contain the rape scenes, it would have been so sweet that I would have turned it off before I regurgitated. This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't - but it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at instilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about male bounding. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone.",10
This is the definition of a what a Great movie supposed to be like!,10
"This is an amazing movie.  The acting is incredible and the screenplay and direction are amazing.  Extremely powerful and pretty depressing, it actually has a pretty heartwarming kind of ending and the way everything ties together at the end is simply brilliant.  You must see this movie, definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen.",10
"When I watched this movie for the first time I knew anything about the movie, but I had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, I saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor.",6

One of the best prison movie ever made. I can't imagine talking about movies without mentioning this film.,9
"This film is story driven rather than character driven which means it'll always be liked by people but will never be one of the all-time greats. I have no problem with the plot design - it's well assembled and effectively climaxed. Overall, a well thought out entertaining film. The dialogue and characterisation devices however were cheesy and untrue to the world of the story.1)The new inmates line up for a speech from the warden. One inmate growls: ""When do we eat?"". Unrealistic and unnecessary. He might well have said: ""Please hit me several times so the audience can see how brutal this prison is."" The brutality of the prison is conveyed when crying fat boy gets kicked to death, so this addition is pointless.2)The story had already established freemans and robbins friendship, when freeman leans over to robbins and says: ""We're kinda becomin friends aren't we?"" Can you ever imagine any grown adult actually saying that to another?3)Worst scene of the film: the music scene. The film uses music to symbolise the theme of hope (robbins mind music in the hole, freemans harmonica). This is first introduced when robbins locks himself in the office and blares loud music all over the prison. Yeah OK, willful main character. But when the warden and guards shout for him to turn it off, what does he do? He sits back with feet up and smug grin plastered on his face. The guards bang again and again. What does he do? He leans over to the gramaphone and turns the volume up. I mean, come on, do me a favour. His punishment is a month in the hole, and for a simple reason. If the scriptwriter had shown the guards breaking in and kicking him almost to death (which is what really would have happened), then the audience is left thinking: ""What a fool"". The scene was silly and should've been rethought.Finally, can someone please tell me how he got that poster of Racquel Welch back on the wall after he climbed frontways into that tunnel?I give it an 8 out of 10.",1
"Shawshank is supposed to be the greatest movie ever. It was alright to me.I mean not much to say really. I've seen it too many times. I guess it's cool if it's your first time watching.Not bad, worth watching7 stars",1
"I don't recall the first time, or subsequent times I have seen this movie, but doing my rankings, my memory of it gave it a 4/10 (3 stars- means I may watch it again, but I don't really want to, 4 stars- I will watch it again, with no plans to, 5 stars- ordinary, will neither discourage or actively encourage people to watch...).I watched it again last night because of it's IMDb ranking to see if the world is right, and I am an a contrary prick... the answer- the world is wrong.Basically this movie has been reviewed too many times by sentimental @$$holes who are too much in love with the richness and satisfaction of Morgan Freemans voice and the lulling of a placid soundtrack.It has some great stars, Clancy Brown is unbelievable, menacing and awesome. Probably one of the only people you can have speak in a Morgan Freeman movie and think- ""What a great voice!"" Robbins, I found to be a whimsical toss, his years of rape didn't make sense, if he was such a good guy, such a smart guy, why he couldn't have solved a 3 year gang rape run? Also, 'Andy' is put in the hole for almost a month and in that time, the guards didn't destroy his poster, a criminal didn't take it down or stick their d@#$ into it? His room never got tossed? The poster never got touched in the dozen years he had it up? He openly talks of his geology skill and his knowledge of cutting rock, and the guards/warden/convicts never saw a 'red flag'?This is just an overly sentimental, Vaseline around the lens 'bow of the Titanic moment' movie, with no wit, grit or heart. I guess I have seen too many realistic and quality prison shows, movies, documentary's to take this dated circle-jerk seriously, it is absolutely no 10/10.A guy spends a decade plus being gang raped, doing tax returns and legal favors for the guards that abuse and in at least one case kill the inmates? This movie is no 'Green Mile' and 'Green Mile' isn't as good as a single episode of 'HBO's- OZ'!I give it an extra star, raising it up to- 5/10, because there is nothing bad about it, and I wouldn't discourage someone from watching it. But don't ask me to score this soft and mushy pointless 'love story', that is too chicken to actually 'show' the love scenes between the two main characters a 10/10 when it's not even as good as the 'Family Guy' parody...",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. The story is about a banker (Tim Robbins), wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover, who finds the strength to deal with the brutality of prison, thanks to a murderer serving a life term.The film is a tense drama of injustice and male dignity, brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's story, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their peak. A satisfying, audience-pleasing film. It has enjoyed a curious after-life. On its release in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption had mixed reviews and grossed just $28 million in the US; it did not make the list of Top 50 films at the box-office for that year. Yet in 2001, Channel 4 TV viewers voted it their third favourite film of all time, behind only the Star Wars and Godfather films. Readers of Time Out and Empire magazines also named it among their very favourites.",10
"Shawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time. To say that this is better than Lawrence of Arabia, better than Alien, Better then Saving Private Ryan, is just ridiculous. This movie is weak, as are all the characters in it. I'll never forgot the scene where the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano symphony kicks in. Why should I feel sorry for him? Try living in Africa buddy and tell me how hard your life is. This movie is for weak people who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak people. Now I love the director of this and Stephen King, but im sorry, this isn't a masterpiece, it's forcing the audience into the characters emotional problems that few can relate. Go see the Green Mile instead.Rating = D-VideoGameHollywood.com",10
Steven spielberg never ceases to amaze with his movies,10
This movie gives you unique feelings about you and your surroundings,10
"I always heard that this movie was good, so I decided to check it out. And I gotta say, I was quite impressed. The tone, characterization, screenplay, etc. are all fantastic. Is it the best movie of all time? Tough call. But it is one of the few movies I can say is 10/10 stars.",10
Truly a masterpiece of cinema. This is definitely one of my favorite movies.,10
I don't know anyone who dislikes this film. It's an absolute classic every time you watch it 10/10!!,10
"This movie became my favorite movie of all time, before i had even seen the whole thing. Has this happened to anyone else? I had seen parts on TV and that was it. The day i finally rented it, i was practically jittery with excitement. This just tells you about my unique subjective experience with it. After it was over, I wasn't dissatisfied in the least. It is truly a great film all around. It is one of those things where part of me wants everyone in the world to see it, but another part of me feels like my personal experience with it makes it my own. I don't want to write an extensive review and put it under some kind of lens and analyze it. I'll just say that from that day forward, The Shawshank Redemption had profoundly affected the way I view movies and it his been the gateway into my current passion for films.",7
"Duh.....a hole behind the poster,as if you'd be allowed to have a poster anyway,I can't stand people going on & on about this,definitely the most overrated film ever.",10
what an amazing and motivating movie never get bored at any part of it. the music is so amazing and have you in a great movie mode. the screenplay was perfect you can never be bored from it or feel that any part wasn't in its place. Morgan freeman as great as usual never get bored from him knows when to make you laugh and when to get shocked or excited. also Tim Robbins I can't forget him since I first watched his movie Nothing to Lose with Martin Lawrence and the great amount of laughing and sorry you feel with along the movie. this movie for me is one of the iconic movies over history which I have a good memories for it and loves it so much.,1
The best movie I saw everrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrr,1
Awesome movie.it was one of the best movie I ever seen.,10
"This movie was okay, but it had coleslaw in it too much. I think if we take the coleslaw out of the motion picture industry, I would be relieved.",10
"Directing, script is awesome, acting perfect. Film rocks forever",10
"Although it does represent prison life in the 1940s and Robbins does a great job , this movie failed to entertain me. The movie is very well done, but the ending is silly and predictable. I don't understand the hype .",10
"Great film. If you like this, you'll love Virgins of Sherwood Forrest",10
"What is this movie is doing in the top ten? Its a good movie. By good I mean - you go to see it and you walk out saying - that was a good movie. Then you may watch it again because you remember enjoying it the first time. On the third viewing you are beginning to tire of it and the characters seem more contrived and you begin to see how the script has some flaws. Still - all and all - its better than most. A great movie (and there are many) is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you marvel at the script - the performances - the music - all the things we love about the movies. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't come close. Well made, good performances, but not great and not deserving of being on ANY top ten movie list of all time.",4
"Shawshank Redemption is a good movie with great actors, a decent director, wonderful music and a very obvious plot. I think the movie would have been between mediocre and failure were it not for Robbins and Freedman.Its ranking on the IMDb top 250 is a shame. It shouldn't be on a list with other such high caliber films as the Godfather and Gone With the Wind. I think that the re-release of the DVD is the cause of its illogical high-standing.Don't get me wrong. Its a good movie its just not as good as people say. Worth watching especially if your a fan of either of the main actors.7 out of 10",10
"i remember watching this years ago, i loved the setting of the scenes and to me it was pretty good acting. and if anyone is to go see a good movie, i highly recommend this one, with some people it may not be their cup of tea, but, if you want a good kickback with some popcorn and prop your feet up, and take the phone off the hook, and DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR, DESPITE THE NEIGHBORS WANTING A OCCASIONAL CUP OF SUGAR, than yes, this is good movie to sit back and enjoy.",10
It is really a nice movie I have seen. In beginning it seems some boring but after one hour it change the atmosphere. It is well planned and seen are thriller. I never seen such a beautiful movie. The role which actor has played is memorable and very energetic. I recommend to see it all the movie likers. Must watch movie.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption movie love it . 😊😊😊.............................................
........................................................................................",10
I really liked the movie I'm delighted with it.I thought about this movie,2
"This movie will be one of my favorite's of all time, it's heartwarming, sad, funny at times and won't let you down. justice is served! Morgan Freeman plays the supporting character for Tim Robbins and just made the movie. He creates so much emotion to this film as the narrator and supporting character to the storyline it just leaves you in total awe of his talent.",9
"In my opinion, it deserves to be in AFI's top 10 of all time. Just one of those extremely rare movie experiences. The highest compliment I can pay it is that every movie I have watched since Shawshank has paled in comparison. I've never been so involved in a movie from beginning to end. And the ending is so incredible it provides inner joy you can't even express. Gump was very good and won Oscars because of the hype and $$$ it spent & collected. But, Shawshank with no special effects or high priced productions provided better script, plot development, acting and ending than 99.9% of Hollywood films before and probably after it. Totally under-appreciated masterpiece..",10
"According to me ""Shawshank Redemption"" is very bad name. It is ver complex. People can forget this name easily.",9
"Hen I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'",6
"This Movie is the most amazing in the industry's history . The best in the way it shows sequence of the events . Morgan Freeman Played a remarkable role in the movie .... movie has the successful mix ever made of emotions anger , peace , mystery , hate , love , Betrayal and friendship ... this movie will always be milestone in the history of film industry .... View and full interaction figures and the absolute harmony between the team of the film clearly reflected in the article submissions .... The imposition of the spirit of the prison and the transfer of the wonderful scenes that way like a prisoner until the end of the film when liberated liberally of movie's main characters essence of success was felt throughout the film that he is no life outside the walls, but in some scenes .... it's a perfect work by the standards of the industry ....",10
"Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so.  It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination.  I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama.  Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this.",4
"This film is a masterpiece. It manages to wrench the viewer through every emotion possible. With Morgan Freeman's ardent narration and Tim Robbins' masterful expressions, Director Frank Darabont has taken a short description by Stephen King and crafted it into something that deserves to be seen by everyone.",10
"This movie was inspired by the brilliant Stir Crazy starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. As an essay on prison life, Shawshank Redemption fails on every level that Stir Crazy managed to succeed on.Shawshank is nowhere near as funny as Stir Crazy. There is not a woodpecker suited bank robbery to be found. There is no Grossberger, no homosexual black man hassling the heroes, no silly mania scenes. There is nothing here that even remotely comes close to emulating its predecessor.The obvious links to the original are still there: Morgan Freeman in the Richard Pryor role and Tim Robbins as Gene Wilder. However, Robbins and Freeman are nowhere near Wilder and Pryor in the acting stakes and we end up feeling disappointed at their lack of conviction (no pun intended) in the roles.",10
The problem with this movie is that it is to ordinary. It seems like the movie is just a cheap feelgood flick that has an ending that is easily predicted. I didn't care much for the characters and the narration was pretty annoying. I've read the book and it's a good adaptation. See it if your a Stephen King fan or like Dramas.,3
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) bides his time during twenty years' imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story. And being Stephen King, the setting is once again Maine, though you'll find 'Shawshank State Prison' in Ohio. It's the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory, 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, on US Route 30, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland.Built between 1886 and 1910, the reformatory remained in operation until 1990 and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made. In fact, much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution, but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction. Find it just north of downtown Mansfield, off South Olivesburg Road.",10
"Thought to be one of the greatest movies of all time and ranked 2nd on IMDb's list of top 250 movies ever created. When i first heard of this film and its general plot i wasn't too enthusiastic about watching it. I mean, lets get serious... yet another prison movie where someone is supposedly wrongly accused for a crime he did not commit... we've seen them all. However, i can honestly and proudly admit that i was beyond the shadow of a doubt, completely and utterly wrong. This is truly an amazing movie. With its own charisma to it, it leaves the audience on the edge of their seats, wanting to find out more and waiting for the plot to unravel further. It captures your mind and truly speaks to you. Of course, a great deal of respect must be given to Morgan Freeman and Tim Robin for their outstanding performances. This movie deserves to have its own genre. A MUST see movie and a personal favorite.",10
"This movie is a must see! It's warm, clever, heartfelt and a tearjerker. You will be sucked in immediately. It's one of those rare movies that takes you along for the ride and makes you feel like you're apart of the journey. You wind up so interested that you can watch the entire movie in silence and not want to turn off the television or even press pause. As the movie progresses, it feels like you are getting to know the characters and that they are real and their stories, backgrounds as well as their lives sync perfectly as the movie goes along only to conclude harmoniously as the cherry-on-top. Make some popcorn and enjoy because you won't want to get out of your seat once you press play!",10
"I felt very emotional with the story during my teenage. When I rewatched in my 20s, I understood the brilliant script and storytelling of the movie.During my 30s, I am totally addicted to epic nuances of the movie and hidden gems. I have no idea what I might find out in my 40s or 50s!",10
"Nothing in the history of the entertainment industry compares to this films wonderful, inspiring and completely unforgettable ending. The title of the film is the on criticism you could make of this masterpiece. If you talk to any group of people about ""what's the best film ever made"" you're almost guaranteed that someone in the group will mention this film.The script is superb and both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do make it a moving story of friendship, dignity, and most importantly hope. It's one of those films where you feel obliged to recommend it to everyone you know. Theirs something so special about this film and you shouldn't be allowed to talk about films if you've missed this gem.",10
"Shawshank Redemption, based on a short story by Stephen King, is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film, clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has.He makes friends with people in jail, and goes through his daily life. Hope is all he can hold on to, count on, and rely on. Through years he figures a way to end all of it. The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. They hated the walls of the jail. They've grown used to them. And they love them. But not Andy.Everything about this movie is amazing. Screenplay, cinematography,acting, production... its simply one of the best films off all time.",10
"A TRUE GUJRATI MASTERPIECE, EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT AND RELAISE HOW IMPORTANT YOU FAMILY IS FOR YOU, IT REALY TEACHES US THE MEANING OF THE FAMILY, A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE !!",10
"Once again, another year (or Christmas) goes by and this movie is thrust onto the television screen for all to enjoy. And what an enjoyable movie it is - as I've seen it countless times now.The major theme that runs throughout this film is hope. The main character Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is the one who shines a beacon of hope like an Olympic athlete carrying the torch to the cauldron, and this starts from time he enters Shawshank prison. The other main character, Red, played by Morgan Freeman, said he took to liking him from the beginning as ""he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start."" And Andy even inspires Red to ""hope"" for a life outside of the prison walls and to join him in a free life on a Mexican beach by the Pacific sea.And the theme of hope is also enforced by a darker side. The prison librarian, Brooks, played by James Whitmore, who has been a resident for 50 years, is given parole and leaves prison to ""enter"" life outside of the four walls. And upon realising that he can't come to terms with the pace of life and no family or friends to turn to, he loses hope, and ends his life. I think that this theme is the magic that most people like about this movie. It's the glue that joins the friendship between Andy and Red. And its the thing that viewers, like me, can relate our life and experiences to.Even after so many viewings I still feel that this movie is powerful and a revelation to pretty much every person. Its pretty much a powerful contemporary tale of a Biblical story. A story about hope, friendship, loss, betrayal, contempt (particularly what the antagonist prison warden Norton brings), brutality, injustice, crime and so forth.I think that this movie deserves to be played on a yearly basis, particularly on Christmas day. It's a modern day retelling of a Biblical story. I believe everyone should see this movie at least once.",10
"This is the greatest film ever made.  Everyone already knows that.  (If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest experiences you will ever have). I could write for hours about the masterful direction, the acting which challenged perfection, the incredible writing, etc., but I wanted to point something out that others seemed to have missed. This film boasts the best music I have ever heard in a film. Whoever wrote the music deserves the credit of being the man, in my opinion, who made this film what it is.  I'm actually studying music as my major in college, with film as my minor.  So I just wanted to tell everyone to notice the music next time you watch this film, and you will have a much more enjoyable experience. Every person who contributed to this film is brilliant and I worship everyone who had anything to do with this film.",10
Already saw the movie but came back here because the trailer is still so awesome,10
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so Hollywood cliche ! How can this be in the top 2 best movies ever ? I don't understand it. Avoid at all cost, this movie is boring !",9
"This is that type of movie i can recommend to any body irrespective of their likes dislikes
the bestest of the best hollywoood has produced till now period
the cast is good the acting is good the direction is good the pace of the movie is on point and the message they want to convey is loud and clear that is NEVER LOOSE HOPE
tim robbim ans morgan freeman acting and the way they convey the story make this movie even more engaging
so i will give this movie a strong 9/10 stars
thanks",10
"Soooo amazing movie
the screen plan, actors, director are awsome
so successfull
thanks for all workers on backstage
you had a very splendid movie
congratssss.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a film which follows the events of Andy Dufresne while he has to live, or more like, survive, at Shawshank Prison.This film has it all. The scenes, the camera angles, the actors, the dialogue, story... It's all tied in in a way that few films do. The movie continues its narrative perfectly, and the actors do an amazing job at portraying the characters.I don't want to do a review with spoilers, but I'll tell you, if you're having doubts on watching this movie, don't.",9
"It's the best film I've ever seen. It was truly an amazing film, it should be seen alone, and watched without a phone in hand.",9
Great!! good movie.......................................,1
This movie deserves to be the best.. No movie made till the date has beaten it,10
"The Cost of Bondage tells the stories of the world that two prisoners, Andy and Red, set up behind bars. Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker. He is tried for the murder of his wife and his lover and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Shawsank Prison beatings, torture, rape, all kinds of situations are happening, but Andy is committed to life and optimistic. This attitude shows the people around him. When Andy opens his hopeful perspective, he convinces all prisoners that your bars are a bile-free life. Andy will also have a friend who will partner with these bubbles: Red. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, an adaptation of Stephen King, starring the film. In 1995, the film was nominated for seven Oscar nominations, including the best film nomination",10
"I feel sorry for all of you , guys/girls who rated this as 1 star (awful). I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen. Maybe it is overrated, maybe not , but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top 250. This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if you loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give it a 5. I read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying : "" ... it is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star because I think it is very overrated ... "" That's so pathetic ...Once again , STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it !",10
"An amazing tale to explain such a simple message. Be patient, work hard, work smart and what was looking impossible will make it possible by itself.",1
A masterpiece. No other words has to be said. A pure original masterpiece.,10
Where do I begin. This movie has everything. An exciting and interesting plot. Even more interesting characters. An amazing story from beginning to end. One that anyone can recognize and enjoy. I watch this movie once a year during the Christmas holidays and every year it gets better. I can state without shadow of doubt that Shawshank redemption is my all time favorite movie. I might add also that I consider it the greatest movie ever made.,10
I like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like itI like it,5
"The basic story for this dreadful movie is Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner i think am missing something with this movie, having now seen it twice. Its 1 of the most predictable boring movies i have ever seen. The bit were all the prisoners stop and listen to the opera music is just laughable. This just would not happen with hardened prisoners. This is also one of the poorest performances i have seen from Morgan freeman, why he took this role on i will never know. Go watch the Green Mile, its much finer work from the duo of Stephen King and Frank Darabont",5
"I don't write film reviews normally, but this is no normal film. i never tire of watching the Shawshank redemption not because of its sheer brilliance but because of all the intertwining emotions portrayed by the characters.The film begins slowly but Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) has a strange, intriguing style unfamiliar with that of a normal inmate jailed for 2 life sentences. As the film progresses it's almost like you know the characters and you're part of the gang with Andy and Red. you feel andy's tenacity as he battles for whats right. As you begin to relate to Andy's feelings you are reminded why he is there: found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. So when the 'new boy' clears his name there is a huge relief, almost like a maternal feeling of 'i knew it' As the film builds towards the end you cannot know what is about to happen and when it does.... wow; brilliant ending. brilliant film",10
"It is a masterpiece,you can watch it one time,in middle you may feel that it is loosing but overall it is a good film",10
"I would recommend this movie to everyone. The acting, directing, cinematography are all top notch. The cast are so good that its hard to imagine anyone else in those roles. If this movie does not make you laugh and then at, the very least, make you cry a little bit, then you have no soul.The greatest movie never to have won an academy award - no doubt. The greatest movie of all time - possiblyIf you have never seen this movie you are lucky, because i will never again be able to see it for the first time.A truly heart-warming and inspiring piece of cinema. Awesome",10
"This is simply the best film ever made.  It just goes to show that you don't need mutli-million pound special effects, and a number one theme tune to make a good film.",10
"This movie is flawless in my opinion.  Every situation and character are so intricately woven, there is no wasted celluloid here.  Every aspect of the movie, from acting, directing, and all factors that make up a masterpiece are in top form.  It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way.  If you are feeling down, give it a watch and it's hard not to be inspired.  I find more meaning with each viewing.  It's one of the few movies that I've not grown tired of watching again and again.  Once again, in my opinion, it's one of the best!",6
"The first time I saw this movie I loved it. But I loved it more and more every time I saw it again. If you want to have a good and entertaining time watching a movie, buy this movie.",10
"A wonderful film, truly one of the best ever made and deserving of its place among the top films. There may be problems but the clever story line and brilliant actors will distract you from that. Tim Robbins has a good role as Andy Dufresne, the banker convicted for the murder of his wife and her Lover. Morgan Freeman has an absolutely brilliant role with his portrayal of Red, the experienced prison Fixer, in an example of excellent casting. The film shows the corruption within the prison system and has excellent characterisation. The idea of leaving prison is questioned throughout the film, as the characters wonder how beneficial leaving prison will really be. The film is certainly quite violent but the storyline more then makes up for this. The ending is delightful to watch but I won't spoil it. You should watch the film yourself.",8
"i'm sorry for watching this great film by a pirate video cd, that's the only way i can approach movies like this, because i live in china. in this place, you can only see a hollywood movie like ""true lie"" those having radical actions in it. i watched this movie when all my family were sleeping, for none of them likes this movie, they have no patience to continue watching movie like this with no action. and i really touched, in some extents living in china is somewhat like living in shawshank, you need hope and endurance to keep on, i got a lot from this movie, thanks to the director to tim robbins and morgan freeman,and the vendor who recommend the video cd to me.",6
One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass.  The movie could have continued this story for another 2 or 3 hours and I don't think it would have lost my interest.  I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the 'movie critics'. The best movie ever???  Definitely.  Everything else pales in comparison.,10
"This film is amazing! It holds such emotional power. There is such meaning in it, and it is all captured beautifully in this movie. The fact that hope does in fact still exist! Tim Robbins, and Morgan Freeman are an amazing team in it. I loved it! Its one every movie lover, or just anyone should see!",10
"The storyline, the links, the twists, everything about this movie made me want to watch it all over again. It is the best movie I've seen by far. I recommend it 100%.",10
"This is the best movie of all time. It has a great cast in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. This is the greatest movie based of a book I have ever seen. Every character filled every role to the best they could and they all did great. When you first watch this movie you think the story is about Tim Robbins character but when you watch it a second time you actually see that its a story about Morgan Freeman. I love this movie and always will. Watch this movie its the best there ever was. Also Tim Robbins should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie. I give this movie ****/****. This truly is the best movie of all time, it is definitely better than The godfather.",10
One of the best films I´ve ever seen. In the end I cried like a baby. Don´t miss this excellent movie.,10
This story truly is an emotional piece of art and show's a lifelike drama of a mid 20th centrury American prisoner and his friend's along with the struggles of injustice . It made me cry in the ending. This is a masterpiece on all levels .,9
"Okay, the movie is 25 years old. Why write a review so long afterwards? Because the film deserves, the director deserves it, the actors deserve it and, more importantly, you deserve it. ""Prison"" films generally impact, showing people deprived of the most basic right, come and go. More shocking if the prisoner seems innocent, and even more so if prison conditions are very severe. Mix all this with great performances, beautiful locations, a soundtrack that is neat and does not steal the scene and you will have an exciting story of overcoming and hope. In such a mistreated garden, it is almost a miracle that one can cultivate hope, but still so it is with Andy Dufresne, unjustly condemned for the murder of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life imprisonment, Andy will spend the next 20 years dealing with violence, threats, and will maintain his sense of ""usefulness"" by helping to improve the lives of the dents, helping the corrupt director launder money, and dreaming of Morgan Freeman, his friend from prison. With all of this, Andy remains true to himself, dreaming of days of freedom, even when alerted by his friend: that hope can be dangerous in certain situations, leading a man to desperate decisions if it does not come to fruition.ok, o filme tem 25 anos. Porque escrever um review tanto tempo depois? Porque o filme merece, o diretor merece, os atores merecem e, mais importante, você merece. Filmes ""de prisão"" geralmente causam impacto, mostrando pessoas privadas do mais básico direito, ir e vir. Mais impactante se o prisioneiro parecer inocente, e ainda mais se dentro da prisão as condições forem muito severas. Misture tudo isso com ótimas atuações, belíssimas locações, trilha sonora caprichada e que não rouba a cena e você terá uma história emocionante de superação e esperança. Num jardim tão maltratado, é quase um milagre que alguém consiga cultivar esperança, mas ainda assim é o que acontece com Andy Dufresne, injustamente condenado pelo assassinato da esposa e do amante dela. Condenado a prisão perpétua, Andy passará os próximos 20 anos lidando com violência, ameaças, e manterá seu senso de ""utilidade"" ajudando a melhorar a vida dos dententos, ajudando o diretor corrupto a lavar dinheiro, e sonhando com Red (Morgan Freeman), seu amigo de prisão. Com tudo isso, Andy se mantêm fiel a si mesmo, sonhando com dias de liberdade, até mesmo quando alertado por seu amigo: que a esperança pode ser perigosa em certas situações, levando um homem a decisões desesperadas se não se transforma em realidade.",9
"A beautiful film, finely crafted, and completely deserving of the cult status it has gained since losing the Academy Award for Best Picture (unjustly) to ""Braveheart"" in 1995. Tim Robbins will never top his performance as the wrongly-convicted Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman delivers the most effective voice-over narration in film history. I defy anyone not to be moved by the touching relationship between the two men, who grow old before our eyes as they serve out their sentences. One for history. I'll still get teary-eyed when I watch this fifteen years from now.",10
"Wow!  This is a great film, one which surpasses anything I or anyone else could ever say about it.  Truly one of the best films ever.",10
"(slight spoilers, nothing crucial) This is a competent movie, but its presence in the rankings completely baffles me -- it might as well be 'The Pelican Brief'. Its scenes are schematics into which emotion might be put (for example, the schematic of the despairing ex-prisoner Red), but they lack the ragged richness of real feeling.  Where 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' overwhelms us, this shows us a series of events.",8
I love this film but it has simply been blown out of proportions.,10
"Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 ""because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3"" and go on to write what they really think, to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be, i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such, I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such.As for the movie, I can't tell you how incredible it is in my opinion, it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again, and not get tired of watching it, the cast was spot on everything was perfect, the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley, all of it was simply spot on, honestly speaking I don't know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is, well deserving of its number 1 spot on IMDb.Also I read that people don't understand how Andy ""pinned"" the pictures to his wall, it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie, Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of ""how he put the poster back up after entering the hole"" because the poster never gets taken down.",10
"If this was the Wizrd of Oz or Bambi then I could understand the appeal of the movie and would rate it accordingly but what this movie is I just do not know and no one can seem to tell me when I ask so why it is considered such a great movie other than: ""Aww it was nice"". Well so are kitten videos on Youtube but should they be in the top spot of greatest movies ever made?Firstly its subject matter is crime and punishment. This is not a genre exempt from theatrical treatment, in musicals and such, but at least you know you are watching a fictitious romantic fantasy when the prisoners break out in song. There is no such device in Shawshank and here lies my problem with this movie. It simply does not in any way indicate that this is fantasy which it quite clearly is. It takes itself seriously and if you examine it seriously then it has serious flaws of deliberate making. If these were accidental then I could possibly forgive them but the fact is the audience is being manipulated like an episode of Little House on the Prairie. For those of you who do not remember it was one of the many tear-jerking TV shows in the 70s with Michael Landon (Lord have mercy on him). It is not that I am against tear-jerkers as such. I cried at the end of The Champ, like most. I can take my portion of treacle in measured doses. It is not that Shawshank is just sentimental. It is the fact that it masquerades as something else. To be fair this is not the fault of the actors. It is technically a very well made movie. The performances are very strong so I can understand its appeal on this level. However, even these positives do not mitigate the sins of the writer. I am a fan of Stephen King and I do enjoy his stories but this is definitely not one of them. Maybe it is because it is not all his doing. I never read the novella so I am not sure how much is his and how much came from the director/writer.There were many little stabs of: ""Is this for real?"" moments in this movie but the scene that really ended my engagement was the scene where Morgan Freedman is telling the other prisoners about institutionalization. This is done to the backdrop of a paroled prisoner hanging himself. The idea of Institutionalisation as a bad thing became popular in the 1990s when this movie was made and and it was simply inserted, like so many ideas lying about without any research or care for its accuracy. The fact we have an uneducated prisoner espousing a theory that had not even been researched just threw back the curtain on the manipulator of Oz and lost me forever. The fact that suicide was used as a sentimental tool to engage the viewer in such a sham and poorly considered way is simply unforgivable in my estimation.Good fiction is meant to engage and to some extent manipulate the audience but it should be believable and due care and consideration should be taken in the treatment and presentation of the story. When you feel the hand of the manipulator, or see the strings holding up the illusion then the spell is broken and the magic is gone. A great movie should have great acting, great production, great direction and writing. This one definitely does not have great writing. This movie is not what it aspires to be. I am not even sure that it knows what it is aspiring to be. It is not serious, not realistic but at the same time does not portray itself as fantasy. So what is it supposed to be and why do people rate it so highly? I have nothing against it but to think it is considered so great when it clearly is not is an insult to all the great writers. As a schmaltzy Sunday afternoon feel-good watch it could be considered good but Great? Come on! This Movie is a non event, at best. It is is a study in form with no substance. A pretty picture of a sentimental scene that never occurred and never will. A fantasy pretending it is something else. What, I just do not know. Can anyone tell me?",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is based on a short story by Stephen King. Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison for killing his wife and her lover. Inside, he befriends Red (Freeman), another inmate, and keeps making changes around the place, which worries the prison warden.I watched the film when I found out that it had beat ""The Godfather"" to the top position on IMDb's Top 250 movies list. It was great, but I don't quite think it deserves the Nr 1 position. Don't get me wrong, the film is more than worth watching, but there's a lot of movies out there, just as good as this one and there's nothing outstandingly special about this one. It's great, nonetheless, and I can strongly recommend it.9/10",5
"The acting is top-notch, the dialogue is superb, and even the cinematography only serves to highlight the first two.  This movie never fails to bring a tear to my eye.  The tears start about 10 minutes before the ending in anticipation.  I've never used this word to describe a movie before, but it is beautiful.",8
"Though I really enjoyed this movie, never would I agree that it is best film ever.  It's powerful and full of heart, but it lacks one thing which is extremely important in a good film: originality.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were excellent in this film but their relationship is much like the relationship between Clint Eastwood and the librarian in ""Escape From Alcatraz.""  The involvement of the library, the old coon who dies (Doc), the brut who is a threat (Wolf), the hole, the oppressive warden, and the escape in general all come from ""Escape From Alcatraz.""  Though ""Escape From Alcatraz"" is not as powerful and emotional as ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" it is a brilliantly done film and has the originality which ""Shawshank"" lacks. Though I do not want to belittle those who worship ""Shawshank,"" I would suggest that anyone who has seen it should rent ""Escape From Alcatraz."" Then you may think twice before calling ""Shawshank"" the greatest film ever.",10
"This movie is simply the greatest.  Anybody can relate to the message of hope and the importance of freedom.  If this movie can't inspire you to live your life to the fullest, I don't know what will.  And I think all fans of this film will agree that the ending of this movie is the greatest.  I must have breathed only three times while watching that.  And critics complain that it's long.  All the great movies are though.  Anyway, whoever reads these comments and hasn't seen the film yet, go rent it.  You will not regret it.",5
"Emotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite simply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay, casting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the ""cake"". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it. I know you will not be disappointed!""Get busy livin'""",10
"I am happy to know that I am not the only one who thinks this is one of the best movies of all time. It's my personal favorite. It shows the determination of a person to live his life. How he works for years on his escape tunnel. The subplot of the parallel life outside of prison of Brooks and Freeman's character is excellent. I don't think any part of the movie is bad, not even avarage. It's perfect from beginning to end. The only probable flaw I see in it is that it makes criminals look better than they actually are, but that's the point.",10
"Tim Robbins smirks his way through this cheap rip-off of the >""Count of Monte Cristo"". The anti-Christian bigotry is too much >to stomach -- the murderous warden wears a cross, thumps a Bible >and utters fundamentalist platitudes. Morgan Freeman is very >solid tho",10
"I thought Shawshank was a gorgeous movie, wonderfully shot with beautiful production design. That said, I have a hard time watching the film. It drags-on for too long. I think the filmmakers were aiming for deep-thought provoking pacing, but I just got bored. The film moves slowly just so you can see how beautiful it is; personally, pretty pictures are not enough for me.",9
"Many people may be imprisoned by their own cages! No light, no tomorrow, no hope! Maybe you will sink because of this, but also may break through it, defeat it, and finally win the self sublimation! This movie seems to tell us that! Every time I watch it, every time I feel touched, I can have a lot of hope!",4
"Best movie ever made. Based on a Stephen King short story. I've seen it at least 20 times. It never gets boring. It's just overwelming and sorrowful. It makes you sad, angry and happy at the same time. Never forget, there is hope.
Believe in your dreams.",10
And I think that he took a movie bigger than its size and does not deserve to be the best,7
The movie is the best prisons movies but i guess it needs a little more good writing,10
Amazing Film. Very Good. Very Very Nice. The Shawshank Redemption(1994),8
Amazing movie - great direction - professional actors - not overrated it deserve to be where it is. This movie comes is my all time favorite movie list.,7
"There's not much to say about this masterpiece, it's spectacular in everything. Very entertaining and touching. This is a movie that you need to see before you die.",10
A great film which makes you think abot the most important things in life,10
"What an excellent movie!!!  This has to be one of the best of all time. Morgan Freeman is excellent as always.  Tim Robbins was superb.  I've always believed Robbins was a decent actor, but he superceded any expectations I had.  The movie is a real feel good movie.  I recommend it for anyone over 15.",10
"It's pretty obvious that this movie got to the top thanks to its publishing date (1994).
IMDb became a viable site in 1994 and this was one of the best movies of that year. From there on - inertia.
Why 6 out of 10? Cliché, Waaay tooo much. That's why
IMDb should be ashamed of its algorith. Strike it down..",10
"This movie was a great adaptation of a great novella.  Unlike many other movies made from books, this movie captured was almost an exact match.A great commentary on how a person's environment can make them do strange things.  I think Andy said something like ""I wasn't a criminal until I got to prison.""Great movie!",10
"Okay, i am obviously in the minority here, but i would not place this movie even among my top 100. Nevertheless, the Shawshank Redemption is a good movie and solid entertainment, filled with a compelling story, good actors and an accurate script. But i honestly can not see why this movie is appreciated so well; the cinematography is not that great and i have seen many more emotionally involving/uplifting movies as well, just think of The great dictator, The celebration (Festen), Leaving Las Vegas, etc.. 7/10",10
This is very awesome movie rtdfgcvtrfd t4efdgcvrtfd rrefd,10
If you like crime or prison films watch this. Has the highest film rating on IMDB (2020 February).,10
"I'll keep it short and sweet. The cinematography along with the storyline, paired with the perfect cast make this one of my favorite movies of all time!",5
I could re-re-rewatch this every time. Must watch!,9
Based on the Stephen King's book. It made me think about a lot of things.,10
"Salvation in Shawshank begins with a mysterious and enigmatic atmosphere (the result of Frank Darabont's decoupage and perfect atmosphere) and the arrival of Andy Dufresne (a first-class banker accused of killing his wife) to the prison location. By creating a narrator and a relative change of perspective and throwing the burden of narration on the shoulders of the rejectionist (Morgan Freeman), he invites the audience to judge Doferrin and watch his character from a greater distance.",10
"I have no idea why this rates so highly. The whole premise is completely unrealistic. Its an OK prison film, but even Escape from Alcatraz is much better.",1
Jsuudueuueieuururueiurjrhhrhrhheueiejhrhrurujrhrhrujrjrjrjjrjruruwjbeheuueieieiiejrjrjr,10
"It's not just a movie, it's hope, life, death and trying to survive.",9
"This movie is one of the best movies of all time. At first the title+the poster of this movie might seems boring and uninteresting. Once you start watching this movie, you cannot stop. This movie will inspire you to not give up in your life like what Andy Dufresne said ""Get busy living or get busy dying"".This movie is the master piece of art. The flow of the story, the editing of each scenes, the acting of the actors, and everything else in this movie are perfectly combined together. Shanwshank Redemption is a must-see movie.",10
"So to begin with, I loved this movie when it came out.But then, I suppose I had a greater ability to suspend disbelief.The way this movie ends absolutely tarnishes it.It brings it down.Another thing is, this movie has many, I mean many, things that are simply taken from Escape From Alcatraz - a movie I only discovered within the past month - which is a vastly superior movie to this.Some are:
A prisoner keeping a pet of some sort; extremely harsh wardens; attacks by gays in the prison; an older black man befriending the new convict; long times in solitary; job in a library; the way that there are things they can't take from you (here, it is music; there, painting); what happens to an elderly white man; and most of all, prison walls becoming brittle...and so the digging....Anybody at all who likes this movie should see Escape From Alcatraz; it is so vastly superior to this I cannot state it enough.For me the biggest problem with this movie is the ending, which makes me lower down my rating from a 6 to a 5, as it is pure fairy tale that Red would not only get out after his pretty nasty demeanor to the parole board, but that he would not only remember the name of the place that Andy mentioned to look for a rock and dig under it - and the spelling of that place, he would know how to? - but that they would wind up as happy, free friends on a beach, just as planned. No - things do not go as planned, not to that extent in life.And someone on Earth tell me, how in the world is it, that Andy suddenly shows up in that suit at the bank? Or banks, I should say?Where did that suit come from?While Andy did plan to escape, and crawled through a river of....well let's say sewage - you see him in the rain, actually taking off his shirt (not weak at all from having vomited for who knows how many miles), and standing in the rain, it touching him and he is clean, yes - a nice image of freedom for those who feel that they are trapped, and would crawl the same way to find their freedom - but where did the suit come from?The mystery suit.And the ending is pure fairy tale - unlike Escape From Alcatraz (I won't say what happens there).This movie takes from other prison movies, ones vastly superior - such as the movie Brute Force, with Burt Lancaster and Hume Cronyn (where the whole thing of ""fantasy girl"" on the wall here is taken from - and yes, that has a sadistic warden too, in Cronyn, very much so). Cool Hand Luke is also another incredible movie I would recommend.I do believe I saw this before those (including Cool Hand Luke), which might explain not only why I liked it so much the first time, but also, besides people liking a happy ending (no matter how unrealistic - and this was too complicated, with unexplained things to make it even remotely possible), many people probably have *only* seen this in terms of prison movies - so they have not seen the superior films; while taste is subjective, the fact is, if you have seen something superior and totally similar in many ways (like Escape From Alcatraz here), you won't like the pale imitation as much. If people only heard cover bands of music they love, they wouldn't know it was an inferior piece to base it on, as it's all they knew....There is one truly great moment in this movie, which I feel elevates it greatly to being decent - and that is the story of Brooks Hatlen and his parole, and his inability to live on the outside, his want to get back in, and his eventual need to commit suicide, the only way for him to escape the horrible fear he lives with daily after being released. Red was right - he should have died inside.But aside from that scene, or mini-story in this, and some colorful bit of dialogue, which are quoted as they are worthy of being quoted, this movie ultimately is a fairy tale.Oh and also why does the ""rocker"" in the mid-'60s have sideburns and a haircut like a '50s greaser? Why ""Willie And The Hand Jive"" as representative of the '60s?Well that doesn't matter; what does is, there is a better movie to be seen, which this one stole greatly from.This has some decent scenes, but is almost totally unoriginal, and the ending just ruins it.In no way is this to me one of the best movies ever made - it's not even a great movie at all; I would not even list this in my top 200 - the ending is terrible.",10
"This is one of those films that I can watch over and over. The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne's incarceration at Shawshank prison, which is a time span of about 20 years. You might think a film about being in prison for 20 years wouldn't be one that you want to watch more than once, but the characters are so engaging that we actually enjoy being in prison with them. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that it takes place in the early-to-mid 20th century before weight-lifting was a thing, when prison life was more whimsical and convivial and correctional facilities were mostly filled with old white guys.None of the actors ever strikes a false note. In a lot of films there are moments that don't ""ring true,"" when you can see the actor acting and in that moment, disbelief is suspended. Sometimes it happens so often that you're never really able to completely immerse yourself in the story. There are no such moments in Shawshank because the acting, the dialogue and the direction are perfectly crafted to create an environment that draws you right into the story. Each time you watch this film, it feels like we're right there in Shawshank, working on the chain gang, building the library, listening to opera, hooting at the newly arrived ""fish,"" and taking bets on which one will cry first, re-tarring the roof and hanging out with Andy, Red, Warden Norton, good ol' Captain Hadley and a group of rag-tag sexual predators known as The Sisters. Truly a must-see for anyone who has been to or would like to go to prison.Look for Bill Bolander as Elmo Blatch (spoiler alert - he's the guy that actually killed Andy's wife) who's character deserves the Most Infectious Laugh award.",7
I think IT was a Nice and cool film. I have eliteserien to see IT for a long time. Now am bloween away...,8
Yep...this is it...an absolute masterpiece that is timeless,8
The most important thing about this movie is hope. Hope for those who have no hope. Hope for a new life and get rid of the hardships. Hope for create tunnels in the hardships and get rid of them. This movie gave me a lot of hope:),7
"I've read the novella from ""Different Seasons,"" and feel that Frank Darabont's screenplay was an excellent refinement of King's story.  It pretty much sticks with the original plot while eliminating some portions which didn't add much to the story as a whole.  The only part I wish they would have included (that they didn't) was Red's tales of other breaks at Shawshank Prison, if only for the novelty of them. Regarding the movie alone, I thought the grand aerial views of the prison combined with Thomas Newman's score (especially the 'Stoic Theme') were quite wonderful, almost breathtaking in their scope and power.  I would have to say this is by far Tim Robbins' best role to date while it at least is among Morgan Freeman's top three cinematic performances. I have seen this movie several times, and although I'd say the first viewing is the best, I never tire of experiencing the story of Andy and Red, their story of hope.",10
"Its greatness resides in that it makes you feel; that's what makes it a masterpiece of modern cinema. Without artifice, or lies, or unnecessary entanglement, Perpetual Chain is brutally honest, like life itself. It has scenes that are pieces of Cinema in capital letters, you know, the one that grabs you by the lapels and whispers in your ear: wake up.
This film talks about hope and love of life, about how to survive hell with determination, about keeping dreams alive even if you haven't seen the sunlight for two months, about friendship.
Open your eyes wide when you see it because it may teach you what really matters",1
"After having seen the positive reviews for this film years ago, I finally decided to watch it. Going in with a critical mindset, I must say The Shawshank Redemption absolutely lives up to the legendary reputation it has created. Though the plot is fairly straightforward, it is a true roller-coaster of emotions. Every character is introduced so perfectly, that a few minutes is all they need to leave a lasting and powerful impression.Especially powerful is the ongoing narration by Red, connecting himself to you, and a perfect balance between showing and telling. Both Brooks and Tommy's deaths were heart-wrenching, while Andy and Red's escapes were heartwarming; a true roller-coaster of pain and bliss. And as if that wasn't enough, the final sequence of Red's journey to meed Andy again elevates that level of emotion all the way up to the highest degree. Every actor in this movie executed their role almost perfectly, and this will certainly be a film I will remember in my grave.",6
"It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt, this movie along with Gladiator are the best in history.",6
"Its literally my favorite movie. I can watch it over and over again. The acting is of course amazing. Ah I simply can't put in words how I feel about this movie. I LOVE IT! In my opinion its a must watch movie! I totally recommend it.Oh Did I say that I LOVE IT!?
Well.... I LOVE IT!!!",9
"Nice film i cant speak english but nice,
yes nice
the best",9
Great movie. One of my favourite movie of all time. A prisoner life is shown as the movie . Especially we also experience that .,10
Well this one was good but I think it is too overrated,8
"It's a fantastic film based of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. I adore this film, truly. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Frank Darabont as a director. What's not to love? Maybe not THE BEST film ever, but it's up there.The novella is very good, if a little sentimental. The film is a masterpiece, though, that I actually prefer to the source material. Anyways, it's a must watch. Timeless.",3
"A story with an exaggeratedly high cotation. The film is good but not great, and very, very far from receiving the title of best film of all time. The conditions of the murder are extremely strained. 8 shots, in the head, made by an amateur thief, with a revolver of the same caliber thrown in the river by the convict, no alibi, and the coincidence of a snitch, make the story overly forced. Very bad is the final escape. A tunnel dug in a wall attached to another cell, with a vast gallery in the middle. Impossible! Worse still: the sewage pipe broken with a stone, reveals positive pressure from the mud, which would have prevented the fugitive from escaping for 400 yards breathing air. Shining by the same author is much better. note 8",9
Morgan is soo good actor i like him.,10
"None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!""",10
"I've heard of this movie before i saw it, to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue, man!!! when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute, its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the American cinema's history ... I'd like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it, i give it up for their great effort that will last in every one's memory for his life time. I'm sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me, I did my best to deliver what i think. Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.",10
"I have seen this movie and think it is very good, Tim Robbins is really good in it and Morgan Freeman as usual is great. It has a lot of original ideas and is deserving of much praise, however i really feel it lacks something that The Godfathers 1 and 2 have. They are just a different caliber of movie no offense to it, its very good. However Al Pacino in both of those films is as close to perfect of a performance as you will ever get. I really feel because it is 35 years old so many people of todays generation has not seen it, I am 20 and own all three and can appreciate the talent by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the first film and Al in the second with Francis Ford Coppola directing both. I understand that when someone sees a movie and they would like to rate it on this site its difficult to see all the other movies on the top 250, but when you are dealing with the top 5 its not that hard, see those movies and then judge.",10
"I simply do not know how some people out there voted this movie anything less than a 6 or 7, but a small percentage had the audacity to vote it a ""ONE""! There are always that small percentage. Sometimes I believe people vote down other movies in some attempt to get THEIR favorite movie into a certain spot. The fact that people put that much effort into doing so amazes me. I'll take the time to comment on a movie and give my 2 cents worth of opinion. This movie was a classic the day it premiered and the 2nd place showing overall demonstrates that without fault. My hope is those who voted it down somehow obtain a clue.",9

"Amazing,Mindblowing !
I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.",10
"Simply a masterpiece, i was a fan of Morgan Freeman since long years, but watching The Shawshank is something different, stories, life, prison, concipracy, words said never forgotten...
For me, my best complete movie ever with stunning narration and end.. What to say ?
All what you need is here..",9
"All I have to say is that this movie is perfect. It has to be one of the best movies ever made and in my opinion, it's the second best movie ever made. After I watched it for the first time, I was amazed. The ending is wonderful and the plot of the movie was PERFECT. Good action, good actors, amazing plot.....what do you want more? I watched it two times and I never get bored while watching it. This movie remains in your mind forever and you will want to watch it every time you will get the chance. Some scenes are amazing and they remain in your mind. Believe me, watch it and you will never regret it.10/10.",10
"Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale.  It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like.  People like fairy tales, so both these movies were very popular.",8
"Frank Darabont's beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is an experience to remember for life. Tim Robbins is Andy Dufresne and is sent to prison in New England for murdering his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman is Red, the man in prison who can get things for you. Together, they forge a lasting friendship as Andy's hope helps penetrate the thick walls in Shawshank prison, in more ways than one.Andy's first few years at Shawshank are filled with beatings and molestation's by a group of cretins called the ""Sisters."" The leader is a man named Bogs who gives slime balls a good name. Sometimes Andy fights them off but as Red points out, ""Prison is no fairy tale world."" Red arranges for his friends and Andy to tar the roof of the plate factory giving them all a nice rest from the prison walls. Red is definitely a man with connections. Clancy Brown is the picture of cruelty as the head of the guards named Byron Hadley. Andy overhears Hadley complaining about how the government is gonna take a nice chunk from his brother's inheritance. Andy informs Hadley how he could keep most of his brother's inheritance by allowing a tax free gift to his wife. Hadley nearly throws him off the roof but manages to hear him out. Andy sets up the papers for him in exchange for getting Red and his friends three beers a piece. To everyone's surprise Hadley agrees. This wins Andy a lot of friends especially when one offers him a beer and he tells him he's quit drinking.The warden gets wind of Andy's accounting skills and realizes he can use him to do his taxes. Andy gets a vicious beating from Bogs and the ""Sisters"" but this time Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp, crippling him and having him drinking through a straw for the rest of his life. Bogs is transferred out and the ""Sisters"" never touch Andy again.When Andy returns he finds the poster of Rita Hayworth he asked Red for. It comes with a note that says ""Free of Charge."" Red and his friends are happy Andy is back and well. The Warden, played chillingly by Bob Gunton as greed personified, transfers Andy into the library and out of the laundry where Andy worked and endured beatings the first couple of years.Andy soon becomes an assistant to Brooks, an old prisoner nicely played by James Whitmore. Brooks cares for a bird named Jake and is well liked by Red and his friends. Later, Brooks is released and finds he's institutionalized and can't make it in the real world. Sadly, he kills himself and this worries Red more than anyone because he's constantly rejected by the Parole Board and fears being institutionalized.Andy sends out many letters requiring more funding for the library, with the permission of the warden, and gets it converted into a beautiful place in memory of Brooks. There, Andy helps many prisoners get their Higschool education's.Andy helps one man in particular out, a young thief named Tommy, that Red and his friends like as well. Later, Red and Andy find out that man spent time in prison with the real man who killed Andy's wife and her lover. Andy tells the warden and the warden has Hadley shoot Tommy to death.Andy is now trapped helping the corrupt Warden with all his dirty money. He confides in Red and tells him he wants to spend the rest of his life on an island in the pacific. Red tells him not to think like that but Andy gives Red instructions to find something of his when he gets out. Red promises too but is worried about Andy. Andy says his choice is ,""Get busy living or get busy dying."" The rest you can find out for yourself in this thought provoking and perfectly acted film. This is not just some prison movie but a movie about the harsh realities of confinement, the choices we make in our life, and of having hope despite the worst circumstances.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have never been better as well as the supporting cast. William Sadler does a nice job as Heywood, the Hank Williams loving friend who thinks a book in the library is called THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISCO.Frank Darabont directs this film so well you truly hate for it to end. Roger Deakins Cinematography is epic and inspiring and Thomas Newman's score finds just the right mood. This film is one of those you turn on in the middle of and just watch to the end, an incredibly deep and moving experience.",10
"This movie is absolutely fine. It is very well made. Great acting. Great cinematography. Tight script and interesting complex characters. That being said, it's a bit contrived. The bad guys are just a little too bad and the good guys just a little too good. The moral is a little obvious and telegraphed. It's fun in parts, but honestly a little uncomfortable in parts that doesn't really make up for the relative lack of realism. I wouldn't say this movie is unrealistic, but it's contrived in a very obvious way. It feels ""written"" not lived. Now I know this movie is beloved, and it is a very well made movie, without question, but the kind of obvious nature of the story makes this personally for me not one of the greats, but one of the goods. I am happy its found an audience, though.",7
"Best movie ever, I enjoyed it a lot. The Shawshank Redemption received positive reviews on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, to the general unpopularity of prison films, lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $58.3 million.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is amazingly powerful story about two friends life in prison. The characters Andy and Red are fundamentally good men in a hostile environment. This is a quietly narrated movie, by Red (Morgan Freeman) and gives an up close, raw depiction of lives served in prison and the ongoing trials of several inmates. This film is a compelling story of redemption.",10
"It is an amazing movie. One of the best movies I have seen in my life. I like it very much. I think everyone should watch this movie. What a great screenplay. And the climax of the movie is amazing. I think whoever watches this movie will like it. I felt the tension when I was watching the movie. Dialogues are good. We have a lot to learn from this movie. The intelligence of the hero was extraordinary. He was constantly engaged in his work. He has thought of everyone with him. His work revealed many things. The more I watch the movie, the more I like it. I love this movie. Must watch everyone.",10
awesome movie...the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb...one of my favorite movies...!!! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie's can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.,10
"This is an excellent movie, whether it is direction, or cinematography or editing, each and every frame looks brilliant. In fact it is a trendsetting film and I would like to watch it again and again. And last but not the least the background score is also awesome. The background music and the story are weaved together in such a way that it doesn't look that these are two different things. It's like they are made for each other. Each and every character of the movie has given an unforgettable performance and I appreciate each and every technicians' and artistes' hard work which they have put into this movie.",2
"This film is based on one of my favourite Stephen King novels (albeit a 'novella') The original book contained four long 'short stories' one which became 'Stand By Me' (another great movie) and 'Rita Heyworth & The Shawshank Redemption' which has been (full marks to the director& production team)lovingly rendered into a true cinematic masterpiece. Staying true to the printed word, it follows the prison life of Andy Dupree from sentence to freedom with care and sympathy, never revelling in his hardships or flouting his attempts at beating the system. The film concentrates on his will to survive and his hope for eventual freedom. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman were born to play their respective parts in this film. If neither had ever made another film, it would not matter because this film will always be their mark in movie history. No major action sequences, no breathtaking special effects and no outrageous subject matter. Just a great movie, based on a great story, acted convincingly with great skill by two men who could really be the best of friends the story requires them to be. Superb.",1
A classic movie that you can watch over and over again. Brilliant performances by all actors and actresses.,9
"this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I have watched this movie over two dozen times. I never tire of seeing ""Andy Get Them"". the lack of awards that this movie recieve was a true travesty. Tim Robbins performance ranks as quite possibly his best and considering who we are talking about that is saying alot. Morgan Freeman talent overshadow the fact that he was not like his character in the book. The rest of the cast though for the most part nameless is extraordinary. Chief among them though is Ron Perlman. There cant be anyone who didnt feel a great swell of joy when they heard the chess piece go through the poster. This is one of the greatest cinema moments i have ever witnessed. This film taps into you and elicts a great emotion. This is something few movies have or ever will do, but it is what makes this one of the greatest films ever made.",6
"I should have watched this one many many years ago, when I heard of it for the first time.
This movie is amazing!",10
"Gospel song and praises still remains one of the best Medium of communicating with God. No doubt, you will leave to enjoy all the good musics and song been uploaded to Musicbasin,",10
"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.",10
IT WAS AMAZING AND WONDERFUL BUT I WANT WATCH AGAIN,10
"I have seen this film so many times over the years and each time I watch it, I find something new. It's a film that takes me through a ride of emotions from tears of sadness to tears of happiness. It's a tale of hardship and friendship. The casting and dynamic of the actors is first class. This will always be my favourite Movie.",10
"This movie takes place off in fantasy land somewhere. Absolutely ridiculous. Anyone with a brain who knows how the real world works would not fall for this fairy tale. Go watch ""Escape From Alcatraz"". That's what this is ripping off so badly anyway. Alcatraz is the original. I did almost add an extra star for Tim Robbins though. You look beautiful darling!",9
"Saw this movie after seeing imdb top rated movies and doubted what s wrong with those people who consider this movie as a masterpiece.
the movie is so plain i understand it is a old movie and a feel good one but keeping it number 1 above pulp fiction or prestige movies does nt make any sense",9
"I remember when I first watched this film being surprised at how highly regarded it was by my work colleagues (and by many other people too), so I must have missed the point. Can someone really dig his way out of prison in the manner that ""our hero"" did? I thought there was generally a policy that people were moved around from cell to cell over time; and what about the suspect premise that he was able to keep his escape tunnel hidden with posters - which no-one ever checked behind! How did he keep them in place whilst he was in the tunnel? How did he dispose of the material he dug out? Surely it's all too far-fetched. Am I being too pedantic; should I really just be acknowledging the film's uplifting storyline? Some people I spoke with told me that it was based on a true story - it's not .On balance, I far preferred Mr King's ""The Green Mile"".",9
"I saw this movie about a year ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. Everything about this movie is so perfect and if I'd have to choose one favourite scene it'd have to be the scene where Andy and Red enjoys a beer on the rooftop, Even though this movie is a bit old I still didn't think about it at all while watching it.I ussually don't give movies such high reviews but this one definetly deserves a 10 out of 10!",10
Hands down one of the best movies i've ever seen. I was glued to the screen for the entirety of this film and invested fully in to the story within. Amazing.,10
On of my all time favorite movies. Its a great story line with great talent.,10
"Not a spoiler but a ?
Well the whole movie was compelling but noted something
forgotten how good it was when i first saw it 25 years ago
but perhaps a missed fact or?
Well when they couldn't find the gun thrown in the river to identify and compare
to crime scene,
yet they found bullets and broken glass where his car was,
wouldn't those bullets at his car be different from the ones at the crime scene
....would have proved his story
but other than than,
unless he was deliberately framed by someone
but it doesn't even touch on that...",8
"There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Red's hatred of hope, and Andy's response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank.",4
This movie is life the greatest picture ever. I loving it.,8
"Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through",10
"Why this film is so highly rated is beyond me. First of all, where is the redemption? The characters do nothing that can be construed as redeeming (except for the one played by Gil Bellows). They simply survive. Someone who also doesn't like the film compares it to a fairy tale because it's unrealistic. This is an insult to fairy tales. Fairy tales are beautiful and deep, with complex motives transmitted throughout the centuries, the traditional good-bad dichotomy and a clear moral conclusion. The Shawshank Redemption is dull, with some basic and carefully explained symbolism (because apparently we're too stupid to get it otherwise) and, contrary to traditional notions of morality, the hero's sidekicks are some nice criminals. Of course, prison staff are cast as the bad guys and their boss is portrayed as a hypocrite speaking of the Bible yet acting in an un-Christian manner. Can you say anti-Christian bigotry?",5
"The Shawshank Redemption is a Beautiful, Touching film that can not be described in words how truly wonderful it is. I mean, come on, what can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Everyone I know (almost everyone) loves this movie. My sister (at the moment) has never seen this movie! I beg her everyday to watch it with me but she keeps putting it off. She has NO CLUE what an amazing film she isn't watching. The impact that this film has had on me, along with everyone else who has seen it, is massive. This film makes you realize how wonderful life is and how great people are (even those in jail). It defines the word Hope better then Webster's dictionary does.Also, it is in my opinion, the best film adaptation of a Stephen King story.10/10",10
"It was shocking to know initially that this masterpiece was not accepted by audience when it was released.Well it was too ahead of it's time.It shows real character development of
Red...a unwise hothead kid to a wise man who accepted his wrong doing.What I like the most
was its ability to tell an extraordinary story in a very pleasant and simple appealing way.I like the simplicity of the storytelling process.Its a masterpiece no doubt in it.Its a great story.",10
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! I mean how many times have we seen a movie about some guy, in this case Andy Defresne played by Tim Robbins, being sent to prison because he murdered his wife and then many years later he escapes using a spoon or something to escape from the prison. The acting isn't really great, the story is flat like a pancake, and Frank Darabont's direction really shows that this was a first-time effort. The movie is absolutely WAY too predictable, the title The Shawshank Redemption already gives away the ending of the movie, which I felt way too cheesy and fake to believe. In conclusion, I don't see how this movie even got the Best Picture nomination back in '94, I guess the Academy felt sorry for this film. You should either get busy livin' watching true classics that are below this film on the Top 250, or get busy dyin' watching this garbage.
0/10",10
When I signed up for the IMDB they ask you what your favourite movie is? Shawshank rose to the top of my mind immediately.  This film brought hope and inspiration to most hopeless and soul robbing of environments.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic! Does Steven King have more stories like this one?,10
"This movie is very Amazing!
The only other movie I have even seen That effects me as strongly is to kill a Mockingbird.",10
"Well what else can I say about a Masterpiece!
10/10",10
One of the best films I've ever seen is a masterpiece.,10
"I really enjoyed watching this film with my family and friends,can recommend it.",1
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other ""great film"", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank Redemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced. I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing. I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema.",10
The movie is about an accountant who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and as a result is sentenced for a life in prison. The movie is filled with deep meanings but unfortunately it is very boring and directed in a very lame way. Plus the musical score is preety bad and does not spark any emotions from you. In this type of movie an emotional and memorable musical score is very important but somehow the filmmakers did not seem to care.,10
No words needed to describe this movie everything is composed really beautifull just watch,4
If you are above 12 then I make sure that you heard this name once in your lifetime and if not then no harm but if you want to watch a true performance then just watch this one with patience.,10
This movie was great! I loved the character development throughout the movie. It's great to know that the film was later released a second time for a well deserved box-office success. The box-office flop from its initial release definitely doesn't even come close to the master piece this movie is! Definitely one of my top 10!,10
"After seeing how high it was on 'best film' lists I thought it must be something great, unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. Sure, it was a touching story, great actors and of course a great ending, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed. Shawshank Redemption was visually boring and seemed to drag on for hours and hours without reaching any type of plot until three quarters into the film, and the plot itself was pretty unrealistic, sorry but what are the chances of him meeting a man, who knows the man who really killed his wife? ...unlikely. I must admit, its not a bad film and i'd watch it again just for the ending, which I didn't see coming at all. But I still can't get my head round why anybody would consider this 'the best film of all time' because it most certainly isn't.",10
"This has to be one of the best, if not the best, movie I have ever seen. Combining the masterful acting skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Frank Darabont blends empathy with brutal physical and emotional violence to the best possible effects. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is wonderful, whilst clinical, precise and realistic writing from Stephen King ensures that this is one of the most worthy candidates for Movie of the Decade. If you only ever see one movie for the next 10 years, see this one.",10
"This film was so deep. Suicide, murder, innocence, friendship and of course hope.I watched only a bit of this film at one point and thought its alright. But i looked at its rating being no.2 and thought ""really"". I was then desperate to see what makes this film the top of the nineties. Watched it with my family and it simply blew me away. The way it was sad was happy just realising that Andy difference (who was arrested for murdering his wife and her lover when drunk) was all this time innocent after spending 19 years in shawshank prison. its the police that show who are the good guys but in this its the other way round and the way it was done was exciting and intelegant.The scripts was fantastic, the acting was sensational and most of all the story was one the best ever explained in a film (infact the best ever).we all have our opinions but if you think this film is rubbish for no specific reason then there is something wrong with you.",1
"I would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the ""Shawshank Redemption"", that one take a considered look at the New York Times ""Best 1000 Films Ever Made"" list. Unfortunately, the guidelines of this site preclude me,oh gentle reader, from giving you the URL. One should be able to Google it, so all is not lost.The NYT was good enough to excerpt the list from Peter Nichols' The ""New York Times Guide to the 1,000 Best Films Ever Made"".What ? The ""Shawshank Redemption"" is not on this list, you say ?Perhaps, humble viewer, you haven't seen enough films of the first rank. But, have no fear, this is a remediable condition. But, be a dear and do try to see some of the movies on the list,please, before voting on this site. I really hate to see so many people make the mistake of voting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of IMDb's very interesting site. It's ever so declasse.Remember, an educated public is an informed public.Now, do your part.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is honestly one of the greatest movies ever.I was too young when i watched it for the first time and i didn't get much,so i watched it again some months ago.At the end i was left with a feeling of freedom and perhaps redemption.This movie gives you hope,which in my opinion is very importand.It is a movie about human dignity,about always trying to be a better person.The Shawshank Redemption is meant to change the person that watches it.I give it a 10,although it deserves much more.Apart from these,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely excellent. If i had to describe their performances with one word that would be overwhelming.Let's hope more movies like this come out.",3
"I first rented this movie because I had heard it was good and because it was there. Through the first half hour, I thought it was entertaining at most, but after the scene where the one man is beaten and nobody cares, I was totally engulfed in this film. There is nothing wrong with this movie. Every action, every word spoken is absolutely perfect. After seeing it half a million times, I can quote it word for word. I still smile with utter joy in the end and get choked up during the scene with Brooks. Frank Darabont is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen, and it is a shame that he has only made a few movies. The music in this movie is also perfect. If you haven't seen this movie, which I am surprised to hear that many people have not, you should rent it immediately. Nevermind, don't just rent it.... buy it. You will not regret it. Ten out of ten! >",10
I am reviewing this movie soooo late but i watched it late and this was my best decision that i made of watching this movie. It was amazing. Hands down 👍🏼,7
"As a younger viewer who wasnt born when the movie released, I can by heart say that movieproductions has gone downhill. Im not pointing out that all movies we produce today are bad, but that in 25 years of evolving in technology and having good actors, writers etc. No movies would stand a chance to being as good as this was. This movie shows the true art of directing and storytelling.Its a kind of movie that got me thinking, learning and at the same time connect emotionally with the characters.I pat myself on the back for going on IMDB and hitting the top rated movies of all time. If I didnt, I wouldnt have had the chance to view this masterpiece.",9
"i pretty much hated this movie. its a prison movie, so plot is basically Tim robins gets framed than raped and eventually escapes. Morgan freeman is locked up and i don't know he just acts like a kid in this. i understand he's suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but really he's giving the same performance here as his role as god in Bruce almighty. even though he's miscast he honestly carries the movie, mainly because Tim robins does nothing in this movie. some other subplots include Tim teaching some idiot to read or something, some old guy hangs himself, they deck a roof,freeman sneaks in a hammer and robins makes chess pieces, i'll stop the the point i'm making is this movie is excruciatingly boring. number one on IMDb, are you kidding me? even from a technical standpoint this movie blows. everything is just dull and unimpressive, hell it looks more like a TV movie than a film. i'd describe the tone of this as Disney's take on jail movies. it's to concerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison life. everyone's favorite part of this is the ending, and that sucked too. Tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer, after digging through his cell wall for like twenty years. his hiding place is a poster? really? to make matters more hilarious he has crawls through a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed attempt to move the audience. Morgan freeman gets paroled by basically insulting the judges, than he goes to a rock in some random place that Tim told him to visit, and than goes to Mexico and finds Tim on a boat. reunited and roll credits, oh yeah Morgan freeman also married his step- granddaughter. that's the dumbest ending ever written. there's so much better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn or riki-oh.",10
"I only need to write a few words. This film made me laugh, cry, cheer and feel warm inside. Not a lot of films are capable of doing that. The acting is brilliant and so believable. It's quite a long film, but rightfully so. You are actually left feeling like you want more. Even writing these words down makes me want to get it out and watch it again. It is always a good time to watch this film. You will not regret it.I'm actually surprised it hasn't got a full 10 stars.To the director i would say, Thank you for making this film!If you haven't seen it, watch it, right now. It doesn't matter what time it is...go! seriously go now!",3
"This is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second.",10
"I have seen Shawshank Redemption for more than 10 times and being a critic i have noticed couple of things that really make the movie little dull and listless.It is not to say that the movie is not good. It is pretty good, with all the technical merits - But it doesn't merit a ranking of 9.3 at all. Which is why you can see i rated it pretty low, as compare to God father or God father 2.One of the factors affecting my rating is the speed of the movie and the plot,it is little diverted and you are not quite sure to understand what the guy is up to. Though curiosity is pretty good in any movie, but this time around curiosity has killed the cat and made the movie little boring.So in my opinion, Shaw shank Redemption is good but not GREAT.",9
this an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable 20years dug in the jail without no body know and abbreviation this is a great movie and this is form a few great movies you will see it in your life and is to be enough the writer was the greatest writer in the world Stephen king Tim Robinson give all he have in this film and Morgan free man he give unforgettable part in his Lief and how was believe the bad and strong officer at the end crying and they take him to punshid him above he did and Tim Robinson pushed the administrator of the jail to suicide after he take all his money this movie i will can't forget it for along time he will be in my memory for ever,1
"Was a great Movie !! I love the story and the actors were fantastic. There is so much to say about this movie. But look, seriously, look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end. Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie, so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. The Movie Picture is very good. good angles of shooting, always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. And finally, check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. See the movie, enjoy and learn! To finish just saying that it as a great movie, oh wait, i already said that, no problem its to highlight the idea.",10
"This film is one of the few remaining masterpieces that hasn't needed, nor will need to suffer the indignity of a poor remake.All throughout the film you feel truly connected to Andy & Red. From the trial in court, getting off the bus, through to Red finally getting his parole at the end.The genius of the tunnelling through the walls, covering them with a poster, to the ingenuity of swapping the books and shoes over with the incompetent warden.Very well directed, amazing actor's at their best.Highly recommend for anyone wanting a good film.",8
Ok sue me for being different but I'm not sure how this slow paced film rose to the top of the IMDb scoreboard.,8
"It seems as if every movie has something about it that is unbelievable, and this movie does have one part, but except for that it is a 10 all the way which is what I rated it.  Excellent story line, acting, drama, humor, relationships... you name it.  A 10 all the way.",8
"Everyone says the shawshank redemption is one of the best films made but i can't disagree. Everything about it makes it the film it is the sound , setting and the narrating by Morgan freeman. The film is a crime drama and we understand at the start of the film that Andy dufrense is a intelligent man and seems very quite at the beginning of the film, he seems a though he thinks a lot.We then get to understand Andy better when he becomes close friends with red who is has been at shawshank for many years. we are then shown as a spectator Andy experience in shawshank from fighting of the rapists which then ends up with the main one getting transferred to then helping out Hadley with his financial issues to then becoming a friend of warden Norton. however this all changes when Andy finds out the warden can help him to get out of shawshank because he can prove he is innocent but the warden refuses to do this which turns out to be a big mistake for him as we come to see one of the best scenes of movie when we find out Andy had escaped from shawshank but not only doing that giving the FBI all the corrupt documents that Norton was involved in which then leads to the FBI coming to arrest Norton.we then see red walking along the beach and smiles at Andy as he is walking up to him.It's not just the story than makes this a great film. the sound which was used in the film made it even better the music used was just right for each scene and was one of the best parts about the film also. if you haven't watch the shawshank redemption yet i would recommend it.",10
"I finally saw this movie.  I wanted to rent it after seeing this is the number two favorite movie of all time.  But I could never find it in the video store or library.  Of all places, I finally saw it on television! In the age of predictable plots, I could not predict this movie at all until the very last few seconds it reveals the events.  We watch movies for the truth and there are lots in this one.  There are some valuable lessons here: never lose hope, always do your best wherever you go, persistence, persistence.",10
"This movie is the best example of that. It is solid, good movie, fine story, has a "" optimistic message about hope"" and has a happy end. Actors are fine, nothing special and storyline is somewhat naive.
By no means this is 9.3 movie. It is simply overrated, it has incredible hype and lots of people put it on their ""best list"" by default.
This is 7.3-7.4 movie at best. It has many flaws, story is not dramatic enough, it is not real and raw. Story is a bit naive also, Tim Robbins is so-so at best. It is worth to watch, but nothing more.",10
"An incredible movie, with an incredible cast and crew! Well Done!",10
"I love this movie. It truly is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. A timeless classic. It gets the full 10 from me. It sends us numerous messages and has hidden meanings. Its so beautifully laid out and filmed. It teaches us a lot about ex convicts also. Yes, they may have did wrong to go to prison but some can't handle the outside world the way they used to. It has all the emotions embedded in it. Funny, sad, happy, deep all of those emotions and more. I would definitely recommend this movie to everybody I meet. Its beautifully shot to capture the essences of every character and their feelings and emotions. The writing is spectacular. As a writer myself I like to look at the writing and acting. I'm also an actress so those are the two qualities I focus on. The story line is extremely important. If it doesn't make sense then it ruins the movie completely. The acting in this was sensational. The storyline was genius. Definitely worth the full 10 out of 10 rating that I am giving it.",10
"This movie is all time best.The Shawshank Redemption has all feeling (hope,angry,happinies etc.).A masterpiece",10
"I'd heard so much about this film, everyone who told me about it, sang its praises. My ex boyfriend said he'd cried at the end. It's even ranked #2 in imdb's top 250 movies. So you can imagine that as I settled down to watch this film, I was expecting something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately for me, it was *very* ordinary. Ok sure, there's some great twists and some parts keep you on the edge of your seat. But the pace was slow and dragged in parts, *SPOILER* just like Andy's possesions when he escapes. A few rare films I've watched, American Beauty for example, have made me go ""wow"" afterwards and stayed with me long after the film has finished. Due to all the hype, I was expecting to feel the same after watching ""Shawshank"" but all I feel is that most of the film is instantly forgettable and cheesy. I suspect that most of the people who have rated this film a 9 or 10 haven't had the opportunity to see many films that haven't had the ""Hollywood"" conveyor belt behind them. My advice to them is to give smaller, low budget films a watch. You may be pleasantly surprised.",10
People love it because they expect to beforehand...it's a bog standard prison movie.. nothing special..passes a few hours if your bored but the sort of movie u only need watch once .,10
"I can't believe it's taken me nearly 30 years to finally review The Shawshank Redemption. It's hard to believe The Shawshank Redemption is nearly 30 years old. I liked Mark Kermode's documentary about this, and really the movie was like the little engine that could because it wasn't a box office hit at first.This flick has everything for sure, revenge, retaliation, riots, racketeering, and yes, redemption.Could The Shawshank Redemption be rebooted?",10
"I have seen this movie around 10-15 times, and every time I see it i discover something new and interesting. The story has one of the best story lines and the connection between the actors Morgan Freemam(Ellis Boyd Redding)and Tim Robbin(Andy Dufresne) is wonderful. The Shawshank Redemption shows what does go on in prison and sort of makes you think hows some normal people can become wise and crafty convicts. This movie somewhat reminds me of another great movie ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" in that the character can go from completely normal to somewhat nuts. And the cruel institutes in which people are put in, make excuses for their wrong doings, and treat people like they are dirt. I truly enjoyed this movie, and for whoever is reading this i'm sure if you see this movie, you will enjoyed just as much as i have.",6
"I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was on the big screen. Let me say something about how movie-goers in my country watch their movies at the cinemas. They always leave before the credits at the end of the movie is up. But it was different with Shawshank Redemption (S.R.) Most of the audience just sat on although there were not many because it was a working day. All who stayed on for the ending credits were obviously moved by the movie. I stayed on to learn who wrote the story. As I left the first thing on my mind was ""I've got to get hold of the novel from which this movie is made. Some years later the VCD version is in the market. I have watched it in the comfort of my home several times and find that I still enjoy it at every viewing.  I am puzzled how a movie this good could let Forrest Gump sweep all the price. It makes me doubt the credibility of the Academy of Performing Arts. This is a story about Friends. When one has a true friend, no matter how bad the situation is it makes life tolerable.",10
"quite simply, the shawshank redemption is my absolute, long-standing, favourite film, and i know it always will be.  it is a timeless masterpiece that transcends genres, a film that can appeal to everyone with its simple message - hope is important.",10
"Simply put, this was one of the most brilliant, unbelievable films I have ever seen.  I had never read the Stephen King novella, but in a way I'm glad I didn't.  I honestly can't think of a single thing I would criticize about this movie:  the acting was amazing, the dialogue incredible, the score moving.  I knew a lot of people who hadn't seen this, and I recommended it to all of them.  Most of them came back and told me how much they loved it and they couldn't believe they hadn't seen it sooner.  This is one of those movies that will be remembered forever by those who have seen it.  Those who haven't are definitely missing out on a superb piece of work.  I enjoy it more every time I see it, and can't believe it didn't win the Oscar (it deserved many!) when it first came out.",10
"'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' is easily one of my favourite films of all time (top three material, for sure). It is a true classic that holds the honour of being the highest rated film on IMDb (with a 9.3/10) for good reason. Some scenes will make you laugh, some scenes will make you cry and some scenes will make you do both all at the same time. Each moment will keep you thoroughly entertained and riveted to your seat throughout. It's thanks to well-developed characters and a deeply-effecting story, one that deals with timeless and powerful themes of hope, that this remains such a seminal piece of work. A true masterpiece. 10/10",10
"A film of hope, lessons, life and freedom. This is one of the greatest films of our times - highly recommended viewing!9/10.",10
"I can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie. But I saw it was going to be on tv tonight so I sat down and watched it. It was time well spent. The acting was excellent (especially Tim Robbins), the storyline was interesting...everything was great. As another reviewer mentioned, the time flies by when you're watching it. When the movie finished, I looked at the clock and was amazed that 3 hours had gone by. I'll certainly watch this movie again.",1
"Just rewatched it in 2020, such a wonderful story behind the scenes and great performance by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.Kind of movie to put on the list, for your little childs to watch when they'll grow.For me, The Shawshank Redemption is very relaxing and different from other movies, which can be watched an rewatched with friends, family or alone.Everyone who did not watched it yet, definitely should do it.",7
"This is a story that keeps on giving right to the end and it is delivered by Robbins and Freeman.Considering the movie takes place in a prison or perhaps because it does, it is an incredibly uplifting tale of hope, survival and a never give up attitude.The story as great as it is does come second to the performances of the 2 leads. They create a connection between each other and then the audience that entices you in and holds you close as a viewer.If Shawshank does one thing it makes you wish that more movies could be made like it.",5
"The GMOAT?????? LMAO
Prison dramas are a dime a dozen
what makes this different from any other prison drama?It is unoriginal and cliched.And I dont like Stephen King.He wrote a horrible little story called IT.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption, one of the rare works of Stephen King that does not contain horror elements, has always been the subject of discussion in cinema conversations. Some say it's the best movie ever, while others think it's the most over-rated movie ever.. I think it's one of the best movies ever.",6
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a very emotional movie. It takes its time telling its story but it doesn't feel long. It is a great looking movie with a terrific cast. The cast all deliver top-notch performances, especially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The last forty minutes of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are classic. Writer/director Frank Darabont does a great job mixing violence, cruelty and humanity into a very satisfying watch.",1
"Just another review on how good this movie is. The development of the ""mystery-scam"" was amazing and the plot twists the best in all film land. Performances on point, clever script and well executed story. A must see!!",10
"This movie is just awesomely brilliant. Okay, English teachers may not like that description, but simply put, this movie is one great movie. This movie is about a prison in Maine named Shawshank. A wealthy banker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is arrested, charged, and convicted for murdering his wife and her lover. He claims that he did not do it, but the evidence points directly to him. He claims that he is innocent, but so does everybody else in Shawshank. Andy, though, proclaims his innocence right through to the end. He says ""the only time I became crooked was when I came to Shawshank"".The Shawshank Redemption is adapted from the Stephen King novel ""Rita Heywood and the Shawshank Redemption"", and as is typical for Stephen King, the horror comes not from the supernatural but from the natural. The horror here is of being thrown into prison an innocent man, and then never being able to leave because of the corruption all around. Andy is clearly innocent by the closing stages of the movie, but by that time he is such a key element to the Warden's plans, that there is no way he is ever going to be allowed to leave. Ebert speaks of the horror of time and of daily routine here, but more so there is the sense of alienation. Once one is inside the walls one can never really leave. When one prisoner, Brooks Halten (James Whitmore) is released, he kills himself due to the fact that he is free. Red (Morgan Freeman) says when he is finally released, that without the strict routine of the prison system and with the freedom of daily life, he just cannot cope.Andy is different, he has hope, and he retains this hope right through until the end. We do not see the big picture until the end of the movie, when we are revealed all, but Andy remains calm, patient, and resolute, knowing that in the end he is going to be free. He is also an opportunist, he sees an opportunity and he takes it, and when he does, he gains the friends that he needs to survive in the prison. He is not a pushover, for when the sisters seek to violate them, he fights, and he fights brutally, but he knows that in the end he will be out and he puts up with it.This movie is about hope. It is not a fantasy: Red says ""if this was a fantasy then he would have fought them off and everything would have been fine, but it is not."" This is real and King has pulled no punches. Yet also the hope is there; we see real characters with real fallibilities. Even Andy falls occasionally and is blackmailed into submission, but he has that hope and he always looks forward to freedom.",10
I'm 12 years old (don't tell my parents) and even though it doesn't have a full storyline and it's a bit long but I didn't get bored one bit. Great acting and great story. It should of won best picture.,10
"There are few movies ever made that require no justification as to why some (or in this case almost everyone) considers it a classic, Shawshank Redemption is one of those films.Shawshank lives onto this day in such high esteem that it feels almost pitiless to do a ""normal"" review of the film for by now almost everyone out there has seen or knows of the movie that inspired us to ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" a movie that after watching it makes you feel like you could achieve anything or escape any prison either physically or metaphorically.Upon re-watching the movie for the umpteenth time it occurred to me that there are so many reasons as to why Shawshank is the film it is, a film that has so many elements that are truly classic. Here are some of the points in the film that to me make this movie endlessly rewarding and virtually as flawless as a movie could ever aim to be.Shawshank Prison: is there anything more foreboding than the flying camera zooming over the prison grounds as a bus of ""fresh fish"" arrives? Shawshank acts as a character in itself both endlessly scary yet sadly home to many convicted men.Morgan Freeman as Red: introducing the world to the now overused but never better voice over work of Freeman, Shawshank offered Freeman the role of his career as wise and deep thinking Red, a character everyone feels an affection towards.Thomas Newman's score: crafting a score that ranges from the haunting to the uplifting, Newman's score for Shawshank is a work of a true musically genius and has cues that to this day are used in all manners of film and other advertising. Try not to feel emotion as the music kicks in as Brook's leaves prison.The Script: turning Stephen Kings short story into an epic 2 hour plus feature film may have to some seemed like a pipe dream but what Darabont did with the script is nothing short of a magnificent work by a wordsmith that will never top what he did here. Classic examples include: ""Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has"" or ""The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing s**t they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell and those bars slam home that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it"".The story: The journey Tim Robbins's Andy takes over 20 years in Shawshank is one we the viewer's feel like we take to. Never more so have we felt the sweat of prison workshops like we do here, the feeling of relief in times of outdoor recess or the fear of guards lying in wait to throw us in the ""hole"" or react with their batons. Shawshank is more than a prison movie however it is a life affirming tale of hope, loss and friendship.The Shawshank Redemption will continue to live on and be a part of best of lists, a future it deserves. Upon reflection and re-watch I can say one thing for certain and use a word that did not exist when Shawshank first entered our world. Shawshank redemption is the best ""bro-mance"" tale we will ever see, a tale that we will never forget and a movie that will never grow tired or old.5 Rita Hayworth posters out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",10
"(spoilers)What I experienced in watching SR was close to a miracle. No, nothing religious about it. What I mean is, nearly ten years after its release, I was able to watch it without having heard anything about it before, including the ""big twist"". All I know is that it ranks #2 in the IMDB poll, and I share the puzzlement expressed in one of the comments (not that the film does not deserve ranking high....but THAT high?).Watching it on TV and interrupted by numerous commercials hopefully did not take too much away. But what can I possibly say that has not been said in the one thousand one hundred twenty-five comments posted to-date on SR? Well, in my complete ignorance, I was led by the name of King to believe that this was a horror. When this misconception was soon dispelled, I continued to try to make up my mind as to whether the film falls into any specific genre and perhaps sub-genre (as High Noon created a sub-genre in Westerns). I was also not quite sure whether I was supposed to be made to think deeply or to be entertained. Then came the big escape, and I was enormously entertained.If I were to mention just one thing about SR that impressed me most, it would be the character of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins: an endurer, but not a martyr; a hero, but not squeaky clean; a loyal friend, but not a passionate man. Whatever he is or is not, one image emerges clearly: he is cool!A fantastic film, and hats raised to Tim Robbins.",1
"This movie, which I have seen at least 15 times, is my pick for the best movie of the past 20 years and certainly among my Top 10 Films of all time. It was a wonderful story with one of the best endings I've ever experienced in a film. Morgan Freeman fully deserved his Oscar nomination but, conversely, Tim Robbins was robbed of his. His portrayal of Andy DuFresne, a convict lifer wrongfully convicted of killing his wife, was nothing short of amazing. How the academy could have overlooked him in their voting is beyond me and everyone else I know that has seen the film. This is the only film for which I have never heard a bad comment and it got rave reviews from everyone I told to see it. If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, you've missed one of the most wonderful and powerful films of all time. See it today! You'll thank me.",10
This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It is kind of scary at time. It is a great movie. See it. It is one of the best movies ever. There no reason not to like movie. It is a great movie.,7
"Beautiful film about captivity and hope that helps you survive, this movie is very hard and raw and hard and for this you stick to the screenfrom the beginning at the end, it's impossible to get bored, and the ending is fantastic ande is the fantastic conclusion of a very deep movie.",10
This movie is not made this is crafted and it is so much beautifully crafted that you feel mesmerising after seeing it. Entire movie will keep you spellbound. There is no doubt why the movie tops the chart in IMDb. For me this is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Beauty redefined.,10
"Tim Robbins as a banker who goes to prison being accused of murdering his wife and her lover.Sentence: life in prison.Morgan Freeman is his fellow inmate ""Red"" and William Sadler is Heywood.Later a young inmate, Gil Bellows as Tommy joins in.The poster of Rita Hayworth has a big role in the film.Later it's Marilyn Monroe and finally it's Raquel Welch.Frank Darabont directed this marvelous film based on Stephen King's short story.It's one of the best movies made of King's stories.Probably the best one alongside The Shining (1980).The acting is superb.The story is fantastic.The Shawshank Redemtion is a big movie.A kind of movie we should see more often.",10
"Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, James Whitmore and Clancy Brown star in this 1994 drama based on Stephen King's short story, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" This tells of mild-mannered Banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) who is framed for murdering his wife and her lover. He's sent to New England prison, Shawshank where he befriends convicted murderer, Ellis Redding aka ""Red"" (Freeman). Andy also puts up with corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Gunton) and his Guard Captain, Byron Hadley (Brown). Andy doesn't let them or the prison get the best of him because he has hope keeping him going. Sadler (Die Hard 2) plays prison inmate, Haywood who is friends with Red and Andy and the late, Whitmore (Psycho) plays their other friend, Brooks. I love this film, Robbins and Freeman are terrific in it and together, the rest of the cast is good as well and Thomas Newman's score is excellent. This is the film that always gives us hope and I highly recommend it.",10
"Very very weak. There is practically nothing in the entire film that surprises us in any way. If the purpose of the film was to be edifying, frankly, I saw nothing useful, neither moral nor spiritual. And it's not because I'm hard at heart; on the contrary, I have a good heart and high conservative moral values. But I finished watching this movie and I felt me depressed and upset by the waste of my time. In fact, I already got used to not giving credit to the high ratings of IMDb users.",5
"I watched this film two times. I liked the idea that Andy Dufresne story is the one that impacts Red to change. I find the narration very much needed in the story, and this story is to me about hope and finding your way into leaving a mark on this planet.",10
"Tim Robbins is Andy a successful but alcoholic banker that is accused of killing his wife and his wife's lover and sentenced to the worst prison of all, Shawshank.It is run by an iron fisted warden and his nasty sadistic Captain played by the great character actor, Clancy Brown.He is sentenced to two life terms and while trying to bind his time there, he meets wise prisoner Red played by the great Morgan Freeman.As he is the eyes and ears technically of the inmates and teaches Andy to survive. While the years and decades pass as Andy went from naive to wise and mature.But that doesn't mean he will not stop of getting freedom and you find out why he needs over in the rocks not just to play checkers by using the rocks instead of the actual checkers.He ends up from being beaten up when he first gets in but that over in being kind of like the head of the inmates technically over time.The ending is really suspenseful there and really you will have to see it to believe it.",10
"Beginning in the late 1940s comes this gripping, poignant, one of a kind prison saga from director Frank Darabont. Freeman is brilliant as a slick but cynical inmate who's spent most of his life within the cruel prison system of Shawshank; Robbins is riveting as a hotshot Maine banker-turned-new inmate with whom he forms an unbreakable bond, and comes to admire for his will, determination, and endless grasp of hope that allows him to transcend the boundaries of his turbulent surroundings. Their deep, emotional bond is the focus of this long, arduous, and compelling journey that showcases friendship and the sheer power of the human spirit unlike any other film of its time. This remarkable, in-depth, allegorical and unforgettable story will certainly be remembered for years to come. ****",5
"In my opinion, what this film shows is that the core of human nature is that people can become human beings just because no matter how unfair, difficult and cruel they are, they do not lose the goodness of human nature and the pursuit of freedom and keep it. Andy did not lose the good human nature from the beginning to the end in the evil city which devoured the body and soul cruelly. He tenaciously completed the persistence of human nature, that is, the tenacious self-consciousness and affirmation of emotion, right and value as a person. Reason made him never admit his life, convinced him that human nature could not be mixed up, made him always have hope and imagination for freedom, and made him make unremitting efforts to redeem himself and realize the real freedom of human body.",10
"At this writing I see that there is already 6,329 reviews of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on IMDb so what the heck, I'll throw in my two cents worth.""The Shawshank Redemption"" was adapted from a Stephen King novelette about a wrongly convicted murderer's 19 year odyssey through Shawshank prison in Maine. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. We don't learn until later that he really was innocent. Andy is taken under the wing of veteran lifer Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) who shows him the ways of prison life.Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is a strict Bible thumper who together with his sadistic Captain of the Guards Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), maintain order within the prison. A convict named Bogs (Mark Rolston) sets his sights on Andy for homosexual purposes. Andy is continuously attacked by Bogs and his friends. While working on a roof top, Andy overhears Hadley's complaints over taxes on a small inheritance. Andy tells Hadley of a way in which he can avoid any taxes. As his ""fee"" Andy asks for beer for his co-workers which puts him favor with the group. Later, when Bogs and his gang rough up Andy, Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp and renders him a parapalygic.Warden Norton sees possibilities in Andy and re-assigns him to the prison library being run by lifer Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). Andy through an exhaustive letter writing campaign, manages to gain funding from the state to expand the library along with a supply of used books. Andy does Income taxes for the guards and tutors some prisoners as well. Norton is impressed Under a scheme where prisoners are loaned out to the community for work on public projects, Norton develops a kick back scheme and employs Andy to keep the books for him.A young convict named Tommy (Gil Bellows) comes to the prison and after gaining the confidence of Andy and Red, tells a tale of a prisoner that he had shared a cell with who admitted to killing Andy's wife and lover. Andy goes to Warden Norton to seek a new trial. Norton not wanting to lose Andy because of his accounting skills, refuses to help him. An argument ensues and Andy is thrust into solitary.When he is released from solitary, Andy becomes distant and becomes a loner. What he is really doing is hatching an elaborate frame-up of Norton and his cronies while also planning to escape. One morning g at roll call Andy does not answer and......................................................................................This film deservedly was nominated for seven Academy Awards. The acting is superb. Robbins and Woodward are tremendous as the two main characters. Gunton and Brown are great as the main villains. But veteran James Whitmore almost steals the movie with his sympathetic portrayal of the paroled lifer who tries to adjust to society after 50 years in prison.A great movie.",5

"Have heard much about this flick, but haven't gotten around to watching until now.Over the course of several years, 2 convicts form a friendship, seeking consolation &, eventually, redemption through basic compassion.I found the film to be pretty good. While not amazing, it still has great performances from the 2 leads Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman. The story is great & the climax is pretty good too. The film is a little long but not bad with a runtime of 2 hours & 12 minutes, along with decent pacing it does go by fairly fast. There's some action sequences here, but the drama is where this film is mostly at & it's pretty good drama too.Overall, it's a great film. While not as amazing as a lot of people say it is, it's a good film generally speaking & has great performances from the 2 leads. At 132 minutes & with some fairly fast pacing, you get to see a great story full of drama unfold to a satisfying climax. Give this a watch if you haven't already, it's good.8/10.",10
"Back in 1994, 'The Shawshank Redemption' opened to lukewarm reviews and mild economic success, securing less than $30 million at the domestic box office. Though nominated for a very respectable seven Academy Awards, it failed to win any of these, up against the likes of 'Forrest Gump' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Since then, the film has steadily grown in popularity and now stands as one of the most highly-regarded films of the 1990's.Convicted for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover, a crime of which he claims to be innocent, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, 'Mystic River,' 2003) is ordered to serve two back-to-back life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Life is hard. The prison guards are brutal and unforgiving, many prisoners are ruthlessly antagonistic towards Andy, and the warden is greedy and corrupt. Nevertheless, Andy forms lifelong friendships with many of his fellow prisoners, most particularly Red (Morgan Freeman, 'Se7en,' 1995), the ""man who can get things."" Clinging stubbornly to the knowledge of his own innocence, Andy never loses his hope that justice will inevitably prevail. Despite being a story filled with suffering and adversity, 'The Shawshank Redemption' remains one of the most uplifting and inspirational films of all time.",10
"I absolutely dare any critic, movie buff, casual movie watcher or ANYBODY with a pulse to be able to watch both shawshank redemption and green mile and not admit that Stephen king is a true master story teller!! He is right up there with the greats William Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Hemingway, Tolkien,etc.
And I have to also include Darabont has a true genius as well. It's rare you can get a TRUE 10 in a movie rating let alone 2!! But both are MASTERPIECES and examples of perfect flawless films!!
All I can say is thank you for the Absolute legal steal of 10.00 on Amazon I purchased BOTH movies that I will watch until the bluray wears out, THANK YOU UNIVERSE!!!!!! Oh I almost forgot, WATCH this movie NOW!! Just in case you've been on a deserted island.",9
"This is the movie considered the best by critics, maintaining the spot as #1 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and it is not without reason.It is a tragic movie, showcasing an innocent man being framed for a crime he did not commit and being put in a high security prison. But instead of seeking vengeance; Andy Dufresne is instead portrayed as a more sympatheic individual, at first being the obvious punching bag for the hardcased inmates, but as time goes by (I obliviously made a reference to another great movie, but that's for another review), he gains the respect and friendship of the other characters, most notably Morgan Freeman's character Red - leading to one of the most heartwarming relationships ever seen on film.The supporting characters are all very memorable, whether its the warden and his prison guard, or the fellow inmates - every actor gives their absolute best and there are some nice sub-stories for some characters, such as James Whitmore's Brooks; giving us some of the most tragic moments seen in cinema.Overall, this movie is absolute perfection - it manages to tell a very dark and yet human and sometimes funny story of friendship and redemption, with phenomenal cinematography, music and editing.Whether it's what I personally would regard as 'the' best movie of all time is up for debate, but I truly agree with the critics in the sense that it's absolutely up there!",10
Good and Motivational story telling. Performances are good and characters are portrayed very well.,2
"Just a comment about something that I didn't see anyone else mention recently. (I didn't read all nine billion comments on this movie) I thought that the character ""Red"" was a white man in King's story. Now, there's nothing wrong with casting Morgan Freeman in that part, and he was great in it. (He was cast as President of the United States in ""Deep Impact"" and carried that off very well. I thought it was kind of neat to cast a black actor as President and make absolutely no reference to his race throughout the movie. Would that we could be that way in reality.) But TSR was set in a particular time, (1947-1968) and I find it hard to believe that there was utterly no racism in a Maine prison in those days. Sort of undercuts the realism that seemed to be done so well in every other aspect of the movie. Just a minor quibble. Everything else I have to say about TSR has already been said. Grade: A+",10
Unforgettable. One of the best movies of all time. The description of the life in a prison is so realistic. The escape is so spectacular. You should never lose hope or give up dreaming. Everyone should fight for their freedom.,10
"Few movies can grab the soul like this one. For me, every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption, I remember the music. I remember the framing, how each scene is perfectly constructed and put together, displaying the lives of the criminals. Every oily moment with the warden, every frightening vision with the `Sisters,' and of course, every point of pontification by the venerable Andy Dufresne. While I do not consider this the greatest movie ever, it is awfully close o the top. The performances by the likes of Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown (who was doing Dr. Pepper commercials at the time) and Bob Gunton as Warden Norton were all exceptional. One thing that always keeps me coming back is the score by Thomas Newman. While he has based his entire style off this memorable score (listen to The Road to Perdition and Shawshank back to back, and you'll see), the subtle movements and piano keys turn this into one of the best films of all time.",5
"One of the best movies of all time. They simply do not make movies like this anymore. Top notch cast, story, and pace.",10
"It was a very happy, lovely and life-affirming story and since it's a Stephen King story I expected things to go downhill until the very end as happy endings aren't so expected from his novels and short stories. But I was wrong. This time it was a very different SK story. Andy was innocent but he's convicted of the murders of his wife and her lover. He got life and made the prison a better place after the rapist guy was beaten until he can't walk and he got transferred to a hospital. Since he was a banker, the warden used him for money laundry. He was given cell punishment when they argued over the young guy's recount of the guy who confessed to the killings of his wife and her lover. He was an inmate in another prison with him. The warden didn't care and threatened him to keep helping him with the money. The warden lured the young guy who knew all about this and when he said he'd testify in a court, he had him shot immediately to make it look like a prison escape. Then Andy escaped thru the tunnel whose entrance was hidden behind one of his posters on the wall. He managed to travel to Mexico with the fake identity he created to hide their money laundering. Then he ratted them out about the murder and money. The warden shot himself in the head before getting arrested. Finally Red got out on parole (his parole hearings were great to watch especially the last one) and made it to the town where Andy wanted him to find his stash. He left the hotel room where the old librarian former inmate hanged him and found the money and the letter from Andy. He crossed the border and joined him down in Mexico, in a town by the pacific.",1
"This movie is the highest movie on IMDb and deservedly so. At first when I saw it, I thought ""how good can this movie be? and does it deserve all the praise?"" yeah, well, it's that good and it deserved all the praise now I know.
Terrific acting, Morgan Freeman was at his best and did a fine job portraying Red, Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is a perfect cast I can't imagine someone playing that role other than him. All the supporting are interesting like the Warden, Brook etc. the music is pleasant, and great camera work.
One thing that strucked me while watching this movie is the similarity between SR and Prison Break, yes, prison break, especially the first season, the similarities are:°Calm, calculating and clever protagonist, Michael Scofield and Andy Dufresne,°the Warden likes the protagonist and make them to do job for their personal use°Elderly men keeping pet in the their pocket°Tough and cold-hearted head of security° The protagonists escape at the end°Both wrongfully convicted etcI found it similar and I think Prison Break must be inspired by Shawkshaw Redemption,but the thing they never mentioned it, which is weird.
I love that the escape plan was kept a secret until the last minute, we were made to believe Dufresne just want to adjust to the prison life and make life better for himself while making friends and acquaintances but he actually had a grand plan all along. it is well done and it's one of the most interesting and thought-provoking use of plot twist I've seen in a movie.",1
"This is the best prison movie there is by far, but it's a lot more than that. Concepts like institutionalization being portrayed and taught, relationships between characters, and ground-breaking scenes with great directing/cinematography, memorable lines, this movie has all of it for sure! While it's not my personal favorite movie of all time, I can definitely see why this is rated number one!",9
"""The Shawshank Redemption is a truly solid film with a touching story, dark, sad, brutal, depressing, and inspiring, terrific perfomance by all the cast and incredible story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is not only tells a story about a man in prison but also tells a story about a man with a great lesson that we as an audience can take and learn, overall The Shawshank Redemption is simply one of the greatest film i've ever watch, i highly recommended""",9
"Amazing from start to finish. If you haven't seen this movie yet, please stop what you're doing, and watch!",10
One of the few cases of the movie being better than the book in my opinion. An absolute classic that never gets old.,10
"Films do not get much better than this. The Shawshank Redemption is an emotionally compelling and uplifting story of overcoming the hardships of prison life, maintaining hope and sanity, and violence. It is about eventual justice. Our protagonist is sent to serve two life sentences back to back for two murders he did not commit. When he finds evidence that he did not kill those two people that can set him free, the evil warden covers it all up and stops Andy from being released. Andy is sent to serve two months in isolation, and one of his close friends is killed when the corrupt warden orders the corrupt guard to shoot him dead. And what makes the film so moving, uplifting and satisfying is the way the tables turn in the end. Andy redeems himself and overcomes all the misery and hardship and injustice. He manages to escape from the prison, and he uncovers the corrupt warden. The warden himself now is looking at serving life in prison, and he commits suicide. Andy, meanwhile, is driving off into the sunset, on his way to his new, free life. Just amazing!",10
"Leaving this review for the checklist thing. Great movie, easily one of the best ever. Certainly the best Stephen King movie.",10
"There is a scene early in the movie when the viewer is introduced for the first time to Shawshank prison. The camera takes us on an extraordinary panorama, beginning at ground level and rising up until we see the inmates crowding around like ants. It must have been shot with a sky-crane or something because there is no break in continuity. The view just goes on, up and around in a breathtaking cycle. The effect is reminiscent of the 360 degree battlefield panorama of Rod Stieger's Napoleon in 'Waterloo'. It is almost arrogant, except that it's wonderful. From this point on, I knew I was about to watch something very, very special.The film depicts the institutional brutality that sadly continues to be the hallmark or imprisonment, and how one comes to terms with it, or not. We quickly discover what happens to those who don't. Some hysterical white-collar inmate cracks-up and is beaten to death on his first night. It is a monstrous example of the ironically named 'correctional facility' at work.Morgan Freeman is another actor as remarkable for his voice as his other abilities. He is perfectly chosen as narrator.For almost 2 hours we endure the gloomy, threatening claustrophobia that makes up much of prison time, and what inmates do to gain some little respect and make life endurable. In this regard it has a lot in common with 'Midnight Express'. Except that here we are dealing with an innocent man.Music scores are perfectly chosen. The sound effects equally well matched. The viewer is taken upon a journey so complete and plausible - assisted by strong acting and excellent script - that when the extremely unlikely escape is discovered, we are left believing that too.The idea that a thunderstorm should fortuitously arrive at the very hour of need to mask the sounds of hammering, and that it would be possible to find sufficient air in the enclosed sewer-pipe, both stretch our credence a little.My favourite moment features the abscondment-on-parole of Red, who goes in search of a certain Field with a certain tree. After so long steeped in the dank, evil reek of prison one can almost smell the scents of summer, the mown hay. All is silent except for the whir of insects and distant birdsong as soft sunlight filters down through trees. The contrast is perfect, the ambiance tangible. These are surely the things to savour most when freed from permanent brutality.This, and the movie 'Fried Greeen Tomatoes' seem to perfectly counterpoint each other. They are both of equal quality and address parallels of endurance and relationships from male or female perspectives. I love 'em both as much.I'm told that each bombed at the box-office. Not enough pyrotechnics and CGI effects I guess.If you haven't seen either of them; get busy. But watch them on a decent telly with a quality independent sound-system.",10
"Interesting study of wrongly-convicted Robbins sent to jail and abused by evil warden and (initially) fellow prisoners.  As film develops, Robbins turns tables on everyone.  Understated  performance by the lead; Morgan Freeman, as a fellow prisoner, actually drives this flick.  Didn't see where this differed from half a dozen other good prison movies, but that's why they make all those flavors.  Very satisfying resolution.",10
I had not seen this film again ever since I first watched it in a movie theater 26 years ago. What a brilliant and outstanding piece of cinematic achievement.,10
"This was one of those instant classics you will always watch again, and possibly learn new things or notice new things as your experiences in life grow cause we are forever learning new things!!!!",10
"It's nice. It's somewhat clever. Just too formulaic with the ""noble prisoners"" struggling against the corrupt and evil prison system. It would be nice to see a movie that actually thought ILL of prisoners (as we should). Same aul, same aul.",10
"Andy is a innocent man, who is thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit, he finds himself having to survive and in turn begins a life long friendship with another inmate.This film is raw and intense, it doesn't hide the brutal honesty of prison life. I found myself at times cringing at certain scenes that are very hard to watch.Through this film I felt Andy's pain, his sadness, his fear and his rage; his yearning to be a free man once again and then his happiness as he breaks away from the clutches of that evil place.The acting is top-notch, all the actors give great performances, especially Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose narration gives the audience something to hold onto. I found it quite sad, when Red is released; a man who has spent his whole life behind bars and is unable to find any kind of belonging...until he finally decides to go after his old friend.But for me, it is when Andy chisels away night after night and crawls his way to freedom that brought tears to my eyes....As he screams out, while the rain falls on him. It's one the greatest moments in cinema, I began to breath once again; something I was unable to do throughout the film. Simply mesmerising.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption and the film better assessed from IMDb with 9.3 , and was also considered the Oscar of the most downtrodden film in the category of best film, The Shawshank Redemption fact is a great movie , the more it was so wronged I disagree , in my opinion Forrest Gump is Pulp Fiction are higher , more talking about the film, the script of the film is excellent, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are a great duo, the two make an excellent performance , the cast is excellent, the soundtrack is very good, and the film is full of memorable moments , such as when the character of Tim Robbins puts the microphone a song for all the prisoners to hear, and at the end when he finds the character Morgam Freeman , I found the good rhythm , the film not enough to be long , the direction is great , the Shawshank Redemption is a great movie that would rather win the Oscar , most do not get to be wronged as people say . Note 9.2",10
"SCORE: 10/10As a Prison Break mega fan, this was a perfect movie. It's like they took Prison Break and a bit of The Longest Yard, but made the story even more clever and without blemish. Andy Dufresne...the ultimate mastermind. ""Salvation lies within"". Without a doubt in the Top 5 movies I've ever seen.",9
"Though the movie is good, it's a copy with little modifications. Watch the orignal, Birdman of alcatraz.",10
"A movie worthy of the label, 'very good' – but being number one out of all movies ever? No way, are you kidding me? One should go back to snacking on those wacky mushrooms – please. Better yet let us all have some, those hallucinations need to be shared by one and all. It was a good movie...very good in fact. And without question, this is some quality entertainment. I really did enjoy the one time I saw it. I have to say though, I did not wet myself with glee when I watched the flick. It just seemed like the plot was far-fetched and a bit tiresome. The premise of good triumphing over evil is outstanding. It is too bad that the action of defining good and evil is clearly sitting outside the reality-room in 'Redemption.' 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Prison guards = bad and hardened criminals = bad? Why? I can understand Tim Robbins latching his wagon to this ridiculous notion – but Morgan Freeman? Sorry it just doesn't compute. For me – a very good movie – but not a great movie. I will give this ""King"" drama an 8/10",6
"I must have seen this at least a dozen times! It' has a variety of emotions that which I love in a film! I laughed, I cried and I was in suspense!
They couldn't have picked better actors for these roles.
I am from Maine so having a sniper of the movie take place in my state was also charming.
It doesn't get old to watch!
It's an upbeat version of Alcatraz 😂",10
In years to come the Shawshank Redemtion will be seen as a classic and rightly so. The is a wonderfully moving story about a bonding friendship between two men who are locked up in Shawshank prison for differing reasons. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deserve any praise that can be heaped apon them because i feel it is them more so than the story that hooks you from the first time you meet the characters.You feel for them and you hope that thing turn out for the best . If i had to critisise the film for anything it would be the lack of an ageing process that the men go through but that is nit picking. A film you could watch over and over again. 9 out of 10,10
"amongst so many films that are really well known and stink and blockbusters that stink. This is not a blockbuster but a classic to all movie buffs and it is becoming more and more known and appreciated. I love this film. I have seen it the for the third time recently and still it brings tears into my eyes at some points. The cast is great, with Morgan Freeman and a great Tim Robbins. I still do not know what to think of Andy (Robbins), did he do it or didn't he. There are several hints in the film but I still do not know, for Andy is a hard man to see through.
WATCH THIS MUST SEE

"The Shawshank Redemption was originally released in 1994 and at the time it didn't receive its worthy praise, its due credit for being without any doubt one of the finest movies ever made, a gargantuan picture. It felt considered to be truly great, yet nothing quite remarkable, why is that? Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are majorly responsible. Also though when you're watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time you might take notice of how fanciful it is, seemingly sugarcoated, and may tend to initially and foolishly discount it as being a soft misrepresentation of life in Shawshank, but as the movie perseveres through gruesome occurrences and never shows a single imperfection, never seizes to amaze, it gradually becomes clear that this is a powerhouse of a movie, an undisputed masterpiece, and it's not a distorted viewpoint, it's just lighthearted and viewer-friendly, and you may be required to reassess your feelings towards the film to be valued as one of the very best movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable. It's one of the very few films that succeeds and even excels at depicting life on the brighter side while still maintaining enough darkly despair in proper prism. Prison isn't a fairy tale world. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't downgrade itself with a too grimy depiction; it's shown in a more pleasant way, in a more powerful way, and it's better this way, with no overstated unsavory trauma. The Shawshank Redemption is loaded with unsavory trauma, it just doesn't dwell on it. It ditches a grim outlook and upholds a faithful perspective. The Shawshank Redemption inspires great hope, even when your spirit has fallen into the darkest of places. Andy Dufresne is one of the best characters from film, period. Andy's unassuming, soft-spoken and distant nature makes him a prime target to befall victim to the hideous injustice of an ill-fated murder charge, but Andy is a brave soul, and he will seek redemption, even though Andy's very own soul is in most need of it. Andy's unfulfilled life has found new meaning in the most unlikely place, Shawshank. The story is among the best ever told. I venture to say that the narration provided by Red is the best, the very best of any movie. The narration doesn't compel you with startling plot developments, rather it guides you with reflection and comforts you throughout the indelicacies of the film. The narration is the driving force and the lasting impression of the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is mega engrossing; you do not quite know where it's heading, but you do not care because it is so good, and where it does eventually land is sheer brilliance, true movie magic. The end is simply genius, a clear metaphor for passing through hardship. I love that Red makes it to the good life too with Andy; this movie would have lost all of its might if not for its beautiful, happy ending. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare dramatic masterpieces as it's right up there on the short list of being the greatest movie of all-time. Give it its due. (Hummmmmmmmmmm...the #1 movie on the IMDb Top 250...that'll do.)",5
"I've seen a lot of movies and this is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This's one of the greatest Dramas i've ever seen. This's how a movie should be made! A good story, setting and most importantly, Characters we can relate to and care for. The reason being there's a part of them that we can relate to at some point in our life or it's just a part of our personality. How many of us have felt wrongly accused and punished for something like the main characters? How many of us felt chained and lost in this world? That's how Red and Brooks feel upon leaving prison. The story's about a banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who gets convicted for the murder of his former wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in prison.While struggling to adapt he befriends the other inmates named Ellis ""Red"" Redding(Morgan Freeman) and elderly librarian Brooks Hatlen(James Whitmore) who help him out. After overhearing the captain Bryon Hadley(Clancy Brown) complaining about the inheritance tax he has to deal with Dufresne offers his help which leads to him getting protected by the guards from these brutal inmates known as the ""Sisters"" led by serial rapist Bogs(Mark Rolston). Slowly and slowly the conditions improve inside the prison particularly the library. In spite of this Dufresne still knows he doesn't belong here and plots his escape with the help of Red. It's going to take more than hope to break out of this fortified prison. Bottom line, it's a classic worth checking out.",10
Touching movie that has become a milestone in cinematography. There are some of the most iconic scenes I've ever seen and I don't think anyone will ever forget the most grueling and well-deserved escape in film history. An unjustly convicted man tries to survive prison life by trying to prove his innocence. He will not succeed but he will not give up. Anyone who would have surrendered at that point and serves was crushed by the system that does not grant redemption but in him is triggered the desire for freedom.,9
"Beautifully written, acted and directed, The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful reminder of the value of life and the freedoms we sometimes take for granted.The filmmakers do a great job of showing the passage of time and creating investment in each of their lives, especially Andy and Red. Over the course of the film, you grow to love and respect the characters through every experience.The score is fantastic, the tone is poignant and the film as a whole is a raw lesson in storytelling. Ringing in the new year with this classic might be a new tradition.Additional note: If the language is too coarse for your liking, check out VidAngel!",9
"This is a very fine movie that was unfortunately somewhat overlooked when it was first released. Word of mouth and critical acclaim has resulted in the movie becoming one of the best known and loved films of recent times.
The story tells of the imprisonment of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) at the harsh Shawshank prison. Gradually over time he befriends Red (Freeman) who is the fixer in the prison who can get hold of any items at a price. Andy channels his frustration into making things better at the prison. The smallest achievement is celebrated and used as impetus for the next challenge. The film should really make the viewer treasure the things that we all take for granted on a day to day basis. The other interesting aspect of the film is the institutionalisation as portrayed with Brooks. he has been in prison for so long he cannot (and does not want to) survive on the outside. 9/10",10
"I stopped to see Shawshank when I was driving through Cincinnati. The theater was speckled with moviegoers.. all unaware of what an incredible cinematic achievement they were about to witness. There wasn't the slightest sound from the audience....they were mesmerized. The Jail(was in Mansield,Oh./now torn down), the music, the fantastic performances from a slew of great actors, Whitmore as Brooks, Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman as Red,..they all did a spectacular job. This is a film(one of the few)...that will leave it's audience in tears of happiness. The narration from Freeman is written with care and this film is crafted and paced with a precision that Hollywood hasn't seen in a long, long, time. ""I hope to see the Pacific...I hope it is as blue as it is in my dreams"". This film addresses many moral trust issues....from being raped in jail, to finding a friend amongst criminals, to being unjustly incarcerated and then shunned when you prove your innocence..""how could you be so obtuse?"".....in the end it is the simplest thing, friendship, that is synonymous with freedom. This was the last time I was in a theater that cheered at the credits....and the only time an audience...so small in numbers...ever did that. One of my top 5 favorite films of all-time. 98/100",10
"This film is about an ""innocent"" man who goes to prison for the murder of his wife. In prison he makes friend with an inmate and their friendship develops over several decades. He learns how to survive. Endures long hardships. And accepts responsibility. There is an incredible reversal in the final half hour of this movie, and I remember when I watched this in the theater - I have never ever seen a crowd in a theater cheer louder in my life. This is one of those movies you can watch a million times and it never gets old.",10
"...and then there are times when you find your own soul. This is one of those movies, where no matter what you have done in your life (or not done), by the end of The Shawshank Redemption you find yourself thinking about all of it...I'm not sure I can give an unbiased review on this one, simply because I went through all of that self reflection the first time I saw the movie...now I've seen it some 10 or twenty times, and still feel exactly the same way...that is how good Shawshank Redemption really is...plainly said, it is as near perfect as you will ever come in your movie watching...In case you're wondering, I only rate a 10 when a movie or show really deserves it...you know, when it touches me deeply, in my soul...",10
"It was the greatest movie I've ever seen watch this masterpiece
i dont even feel that 2 hours.",1
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a huge masterpiece. I was surprised to notice the film hasn't won a single academy award but on a second thought maybe it doesn't need one. The movie has a beautiful and emotional story. A story of two prisoners who befriend and help each other until the fateful end. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing actors, especially Morgan Freeman and his acting skills, he's a legend. The movie is based on a story by Stephen King and this is probably the best movie based on a Stephen king novel. (This and The Shining of course). What I love about this film are two specific sequences: the one where we discover Andy's whole plan of escape, the tunnel and the identity he made up. The second sequence is the one where red is realised from Shawshank and reads Andy's letter to come and join him near the sea. The last shot of the two reuniting is a beautiful conclusion to there journey, and the movie.",9
"Two thousand four hundred and five IMDb users have bothered to write a review of this movie. I read all of them and did not find a bad one. Of course I didn't! I had not seen the movie and that is true. Every single one of my friends and acquaintances has, and not surprisingly, recommended it with the highest of praise. The fact that I had not did put into question my claim to be a movie lover. Now that I have, I admit it serves me right to have been questioned so.It is a damn good movie for all the reasons everyone wrote in their reviews and why critics also raved about it. I have no excuse for not watching it before other than my prejudice toward any movie having to do with jails, the prison life etc..Halfway into the movie, I was not convinced my prejudice about movies dealing in any way with prison would change, but the acting was good enough to keep me going. I was very happy with the direction this movie took, especially with the ending. Not since ""The Birdman from Alcatraz"" and Escape from Alcatraz have I enjoyed a movie that has prison as the setting; I don't expect it will soon either since my phobia with that is not going away soon. Finally, having seen Shawshank, I can now have an intelligent conversation about movies with friends and acquaintances without risking admonition for my failing to see the movie. Anybody that hasn't seen it yet and claims some knowledge of movies deserves, as I did, to be castigated. I've made my peace with the matter and I'm moving on.",10
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is a prison film and a good film about characters. The film is about a man who is put into prison for murdering his wife, a crime that he did not commit. He ends up helping the prison guards out, and some complicated issues arise. The film is about characters, loyalty, revenge, and freedom. This film is one of its kind; it is almost spiritual as it touches on many different aspects of life. The story is thoroughly engaging as are the characters, and the different situations that the characters are in keep the viewer guessing and hungry for more. This film is a rare gem that lives up to its expectations.",10
"I don't know why it took me so long to see this film but I finally did. I've seen a lotta films in my day, but I think this is definitely one of the top 10. Indeed, it's rated by the viewers as the #2 film of all-time on this database, just behind The Godfather. This film is a powerful story of hope and despair, love and hate, institutionalization and corruption. There's not much violence in it, although there is strong (homo)sexual content. This story takes place almost entirely in a maximum-security prison. The story would be powerful even with no ""brand-name"" actors in it, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both do a magnificent job in this film. This is a film that should not be missed!",10
"Only a few words come to mind....one of the best movies made in my lifetime. Amazing all star cast. Emotionally charged Well acted Well written Well directed Great score Keeps you engaged throughout You fall in love with the characters. Morgan freeman is phenomenal. It makes you realize how important and precious life is. It also teaches how power can be corrupt. The friendships forged in the story are very well crafted by the actors And through plot development. While the main focus revolves around Andy's character played by Tim Tobbins, you are easily affected by the side stories of those that become part of his world. All in all it is an ultimate feel good movie...an ultimate rise of the spirit in the face of tragedy and life dealing you a bad hand of cards. One of my top 5 movies of all time!",10
"The movie that made me fall in love with Zihuatanejo, that utopic paradise where people can live peacefully and free. One of the greatest movies ever made and one that really deserves its number 1 spot. Because I personally believe that everybody will find their Zihuatanejo watching it. Emotional, fantastic, perfect.",10
"The prison film is an outstanding masterpiece. But whether it really belongs to the best films in film history is debatable. However, the fact is that like no other, the movie inspires many people across generations. The representation of a lifelong friendship between the two prison inmates, played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is outstanding. Above all, however, the interplay of right and wrong, which is not always easy to separate behind the walls of a prison, is worked out here too deeply emotionally. It was rewarded with seven Oscar nominations, and rightly so.",10
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is a 1994 film written and directed by Frank Darabont based on the Stephen King novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. It stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. While the film was initially a box office disappointment it received a great deal of critical acclaim along with seven Academy Award nominations. Over the years since its release it has gained in popularity and is now widely considered one of the most beloved films of all time.'Shawshank' tells the story of Andy Dufresne who is sent to prison for the murder of his wife after she and her extra-marital lover are found dead. The balance of the film is simply spent seeing Andy interface with the other prisoners, most notably Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman and guards while attempting to navigate the fraught prison system hierarchy. While Andy maintained his innocence, not many really believed he didn't do it until another prisoner shows up with a different story to tell. This pivots the film in another interesting direction ultimately leading to the narrative's dramatic conclusion.For many years, if asked, I would cite 'The Shawshank Redemption' as my favorite film. I have not critically reassessed that in some time, however, I can say that my love for this film has not waned. The film is brilliantly directed, written, acted and scored. It is a relatively simple story that relies a lot on the writing and the actors to give superlative performances which every single one does. The film is not fast paced but never seems to lag or lose interest. The wriing through the first half is incredibly deliberate and purposeful, and it sets up one of the best climactic moments in film. I don't know if Morgan Freeman's superlative narrative ability was born with this film, but it is the first time I remember encountering it, and that decision alone lifts the story. It becomes not a basic story about Andy told from Andy's perspective, but instead a more meditative process as told by his fellow inmate and eventual friend. After the climax that delivers such cathartic hope it is hard not to fall in love with this film. While overshadowed in 1994 by flashier films such as 'Forrest Gump' and 'Pulp Fiction', 'The Shawshank Redemption' has slowly and steadily captured the hearts and minds of moviegoers everywhere and for good reason.Eric's Grade: A.",10
"I don't understand why this movie is so popular.  Yes, it was an interesting movie, and it was a good movie, but it was not spectacular enough to receive all the praise which it has.  The acting was good, and the plot original, but it was still a rather ordinary movie.  Apparently, I'm the only one with this opinion...",8
"A great movie, a drama in the life of a citizen wrongfully imprisoned, an excellent plot that grips the viewer from start to finish, and masterful performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and a whole cast of great supporting actors, it pays off.Film viewed on July 25, 2021.",10
"Nothing to say, really. Everything is very good and the plot just overwhelm everything else. Just amazing.",10
"If you put every spice known to man in one dish it would taste like mud. I saw a thing where they hooked up like 5000 electric guitar pedals on one line and the result was audio-mush.
This movie, lauded as having something for everyone, is probably an accurate comment, but I could say the same thing about cancer cells.
It has moments of cruelty, hope, loyalty, betrayal, etc etc, all of which are dragged out and we are sledgehammered with them as though the audience is made of 4 year old's.
The movie is deliberately slow paced for this reason , to clobber us with its character development, which is the main thing that its fans point to as a strength.
The movie does not have a plot so much as different emotional themes.
The story gets lost as it explores relationships and assorted prison developed psychopathologies. So the fans say....""This is a film about loyalty winning in the end etc.""
It is NOT an action movie. It is not The Great Escape, or Escape from Alcatraz etc., although it is, in a sense, an escape movie, if viewed in simple linear terms.
And that is the problem. There is just too much going on. Simply, it is about a guy unjustly imprisoned, who tricks his captors, and gets out, and then in a final ""emotional"" last story element, , teams up with his old buddy on a romantic seashore. Free at last, great god almighty Free at last!!!!!!!!! Which I take to mean as turning off the disc or leaving the theatre. (pre covid)
But unlike a paired down, stripped to the bone, plot driven, well acted movie, like escape from Alcatraz, Shawshank, whatever that means, wants to put every arm hair and booger under an electron microscope, for intensive scrutiny, then drench the whole thing in a syrupy swamp of over-sentimentalization.
Similar to Green Mile, another long King-fest, set in prison, we find ourselves in an Olympic sized swimming pool of emotional syrup so thick it's almost solid, the only liquid element added by barrels of human tears.
If this sort of thing is your cup of tears , then you'll be drowned in heaven, call it a masterpiece , and it's all good.",9
"As i started watching this i was already convinced that i saw the best movie of 1994.And i don't even get why the director to this film Frank Darabont didn't even win or was nominated for the best director Oscar.This film also has 2 of the greatest performances throughout the whole movie which were the Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman performances.Also this movie deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 because this movie will keep you in your seat from start to finish,and those of you people out there who haven't seen this movie i recommend that you have to watch this movie, And has a great premise as well. The movie also has other great performances from James Whitmore,Bob Gunton,and Clancy Brown.",10
Why talk so much about this movie when the movie already speaks for itself as one of the best film of all time. The movie is too good to be explain by me; you have to see it for yourself.Exceptional.Max- 9.5/10,10
"Before I review this fascinating tale of abuse, intrigue and resourcefulness taking place in a penitentiary, let me state the following... ""Bad things happen to good people."" The movie starts with a court trial for the murder of a banker's wife. Our defendant is Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) accused of this crime and all the evidence or lack of points in his direction. Found guilty Andy and other recruits (little fishes ) are bused over to Shawshank Prison. During the ride, a portly (FAT ASS)Frank Medrano starts to whine about the fact that he's not suppose to be here.The rookie cons are greeted by the Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) who chillingly affirms at the end of his speech, ""Welcome to Shawshank."" Fat Ass continues to moan about being in jail but Captain Hadley (Clansy Brown) wanted to hear no part of his whining.Meanwhile the prison inmates where placing bets on which rookie con will crack under the strain of a first night in prison. As the neophytes walked down the main corridor to a loud bunch of inmate hecklers as they yelled endlessly,""Here fishy fishy."" Veteran Con Ellis Redding AKA Red our narrator played by Morgan Freeman bet two packs of smokes on Andy Dufresne. Meanwhile the majority bet on Fat Ass to crack under the taunting and teasing of the hardened inmates. The mocking was too much for poor, hysterical Fat Ass as he screamed for his Mommy as Captain Hadley beat him endlessly with his night stick as he laid lifeless on the cement floor. Prison life was presented in all it's harsh realities right from the start. The next morning Red was amazed that Andy made it through the first night without making a sound. As the movie progressed Andy needs a rock hammer to make Chess pieces. Red being the prison hustler/scrounger can get mostly anything from the outside, magazines, liquor and posters. Red and Andy develop a friendship/bond. One day the Warden offered volunteer work for the inmates to tar the roof of the guard house. The names where picked at random and Andy and Red were among the chosen for the task. The first day as the men were dipping there mops into tar buckets under the hot sun, Andy overhears Captain Hadley complaining of an cash inheritance. The other guard congratulates him on his new found cash but Hadley says the government will tax him on every penny of it. Andy takes a u-turn toward Hadley and Says, ""Do you trust your Wife?"" Hadley enraged, grabs Andy and is ready to throw him off the roof. Andy in breathless desperation replies, There's a way to gift your spouse tax free and I'll can show you how to file the papers and it's perfectly legal for a small price of three beers for each man working on the roof. A few days later it came to pass as his fellow inmate looked on at Andy as they were swigging suds on a hot roof. The Cons at least for a little while felt like men thanks to Andy and his legal advise. Andy had won the respect of his peers. Despite doing curry-favor for the guards, with W2 forms and retirement advise Andy wasn't protected either. Being constantly harassed and beaten by Boggs and his pose (The Sisters). Boggs wanted Andy for sexual favors and I'd like to tell you Andy put up a good fight but the truth is Andy ended up in the hospital infirmary while Boggs laid in the hole of solitary confinement for a month. Word got out about Andy's nemesis to Hadley and the guards and they didn't want their personal Banker harmed any more. Boggs was beaten to a pulp and the Sisters never laid a hand on Andy again.The movie continues and shows the hopelessness of an innocent educated man adjusting to an institution. Making friends and gaining respect with his knowledge in a world of maladjusted criminals. Building a library and fudging the books under the direction of the Warden. This shows how a person entering the criminal system become institutionalized on a positive side and a negative side. Veteran actor James Whitmore give an impressive performance as Brooks the original weathered Librarian. Also notable was the performance by Tommy (Gil Bellows) who takes this story in a different direction. The appeal of this movie is how everything ties together in a hopeless situation and comes out clean on the other side. The original book (Stephen King), was at best, ho-humm by critics standards but the magic of the screenplay brought this story to new heights. Kudos to the screen writing of Frank Darabont. Never get tired of this movie.",10
I just can't believe it to ok me that long to watch this movie. What a fool am I.,6
"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the best film's of the 90's. Morgan Freeman has another outstanding performance just like he had in Glory. The plot was as good as ever along with the dialouge. The music was nice and the atmosphere in the film felt like it was in the 40's, 50's, and 60's. Beautiful full of triumphant acting. This is Frank Darabont's best movie, even better than The Green Mile which I also though was really good. This is one of the most recommended films of the 90's and you definitely will enjoy it. I mean come on guys, it even got in the 250 movies of all-time with a 9.0 and it got #2. Excellent film!!10/10!!",10
Amazing. Classic with good reason. Hope in the face of adversity.,1
The Shawshank Redemption was a true masterpiece. This is a true masterpiece,9
"It doesn't even contain any real redemption, because the main character was wrongly convicted. Certainly this is a quality production, but hardly the best movie of all times, according to IMDb users. I'd say, not even the best film of 1994. These are '94 releases:
Middlemarch
The Lion King
The Deep Blue Sea
Wyatt Earp
Death and the Maiden
Tom & Viv
Forrest Gump
Ed Wood
and
Poirot: Hercule Poirot's Christmas.",10
"A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.A man wanted freedom, he redeems his life by escaping for the Shawshank prison and the man's name is Andy Dufrsne. This film is dramatic take of a man, and in a way it is similar to Escape from Alcatraz and The Great Escape. The similarity is that the above mentioned films are also prison escapes and the similarity ends there. This movie is more about hope and redemption than anything else and this is what sets this film above the other escape stories. For a man, freedom is highest value and he would do anything to get it. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is such a nice fellow that we would for sure like him for the way he is, when he chuckles at the warden when music is played in prison or when he asks for beers to his friends without having a sip. We like him because he is selfless, humane in nature. But more so, he is selfish and works towards his freedom at the same time. Now, in terms of character he has company n the firm of Red (Morgan Freeman) and what a great character, RED was, is understood, by the way he narrates the story. And thus, it's not surprising for Morgan Freeman to have garnered more best actor award nominations than Tim Robbins. The novel, written by Stephen sets it up in 1949 - 1966 period in a prison called Shawshank in Maine, USA. Frank Darabont made it into a film that's great to see but also tests our patience. It's great in terms of cinematography, lighting and costume design and even art direction, but greater was the acting by two lead characters. Just because of their acting, I was compelled to see this story of HOPE, that ends in a good way.The sound design is great and worthy of a special mention as a realistic sound the prison of 1940's to 60's was created. Editing though, I believe could have been done by cutting short a few scenes, or rather cutting out a few scenes, just like say one week of hole for Bogs. I have seen this thrice and, since I knew that this is the best rated picture on IMDb, but the more I see it, the less I started to like it, may be I know the story too very well. Maybe, I am finding fault with reasons of a prison escape done too trivially, by crawling in gutter for 500 yards or by creating a hole in the room. Or maybe, I think that Andy was just too easy and too casual on what he did. These are all my own reasons that put me down each time, I see this. Yet this has a good place in my memory and heart for I see this, just because there is hope, and HOPE IS A GOOD THING. I just love the dialogs of this film and thanks to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for that.It's a 4/5 for a movie that may not be the best in my view yet is a good one to be watching. Go listen dialogs like 'you get busy living or you get busy dying'. They are like music to ears.",9
Too slow. Concept is not as good. Below average movie. I am not able to force myself to watch again.,7
"I finally watched this movie today and I should have watched it way sooner. This is probably the most interesting movie I have ever seen; It has a very intriguing plot and there isn't any dull moments. You will feel so connected with the characters who were portrayed very well I got to say. Its a disgrace this movie did so badly in the box office. You should definitely watch this movie, even if you're not into drama movies because this a very intriguing movie.",10
"I know this film so well that I use it as a connection. Whenever I see another movie or television show, I find some way to connect it to Shawshank. Kinda like the degrees of Kevin Bacon. There are so many great actors in this one movie and when I see them in another movie, I always think of Shawshank. Red's (Morgan Freeman) monologue from the moment the warden discovered Andy's tunnel to the end of the movie was some of the best storytelling I've ever heard. My one minor complaint was when Red mentioned 500 yards being nearly half a mile. 440 yards is a quarter of a mile so it was 60 yards more than that. (Numbers are one of my OCD issues) 😄. Hands down the best movie of the twentieth century.",10
Play The Shawshank Redemption! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!,10
"Honestly, I never expected to love The Shawshank Redemption because I'm not really into these kinds of films. This time, in April 2023, is my first time watching it as it never really caught my interest before. I was also always wondering why this got 9.3 stars and millions of ratings on IMDB.The script is beautifully written, with some unforgettable dialogues that stays in the mind. The movie is superbly acted by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The film has some life lessons to offer, and makes you realize things. Also, the story shows the brutal reality of being in the prison.The Shawshank Redemption is a deeply moving story about friendship, hope, and dreams. It also has one of the most perfect endings I've ever seen. Now I know why the rating is very high on IMDB. Highly recommended.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994, Dir. Frank Darabont) Announced guilty for the murder of his wife, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison to serve a life term. Becoming friends with Red (Morgan), Andy tries to adapt to prison life, and goes on an unforgettable journey with Red inside the prison walls.Brilliant, Powerful and Moving storytelling brought together by everyone involved. Robbins and Freeman showcase their full acting talents and provide amazing performances in a wonderful classic that deserved top mark in best film lists.Get busy living, or get busy dying.  Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman)",1
"This is a motivational story about a group of people in prison. It shows them going through many different conflicts. Most of the guards treat them badly and often abuse the inmates. The ugly realities of prison life are realized in the first half hour of the movie. There was strong acting on all parts. It was expertly shot too. It deserves all of the praise it has received. It's been near the top of IMDb's top 10 for years and it's showing no signs of slowing down. It's very moving and it has a lot of character development. It perfectly represents all the struggles that the characters go through. Also, the movie is highly brutal. Especially near the beginning. This isn't for anyone who doesn't like brutality but it's rather fitting in this movie. The way it combined brutality with a highly memorable story makes it something special. It touched me in a way that I cannot describe. Without any doubt, it's the best drama ever and one of the greatest movies of all time.",6
"The only reason I rented this title was because I've seen its rating in the IMDB. Well I was hoping for a thrilling experience, a work of art at least. C'mon you raters! This is simply a good film! It's ok to watch, but if you were hoping for something better than good, then you will be disappointed. There are so many better films than this! Now, talking about the film, Tim Robbins was not the ideal match for this role and Morgan Freeman was ok for a nice old man in a Midwest bar, but definitely not for a murder convict. In general the atmosphere in the jail was laughable. So many good men, you would believe it was the Sunday mass.",9
"Arguably Tim Robbins' greatest performance to date.  Coming from someone who tends to appreciate movies set behind bars, this movie is every bit worth 10 stars!  I was astonished to find out that this is adapted from a great Stephen King short story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.Before writing this review, I sat down, with a bowl of popcorn and a cold one (Pepsi), and watched this great movie again.  It has come to my opinion that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, or the way it was put together. Everyone prisoner should be allowed to watch this movie, and hope that their warden would allow them to keep after the books, and then use that position to break out.  But, after all, this is Hollywood!",10
Excellent movie surely one of the best I have watched.,4
"The story of a man who gets jail for the crime he didnt do. He is straight as an arrow but inside jail he has to become the crook to get along. He is brilliant, intelligent, humble and with hope, which is a dangerous thing. He uses his intelligence to help the officers inturn for the favor to his friends. The friendship he makes with his group. Then he finds out he can win the case but things turn turtle and you cannot imagine the surprise it pulls right before your eyes!
Everything is brilliant in this movie! Treat to watch.",10
This is an absolutely sensational film for all viewers to watch and really enjoy. The storyline was real original and strong. The crew did a phenomenal job creating this film. The cast selection was great. They fully committed to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman was great. This film reveals to viewers the courage and strength that anyone can have to power through life. I do not have that much courage and strength in my life. I will never have it. My life will always be weak. I do get exhausted from my life. This is a sensational film for everyone to watch and enjoy.,7
"I watched it in 2016
i'm here after years can't find a better movie",10
Somehow in the middle of this film I felt i was in the jail and at the end I am escaped.,10
"It's a beautiful story of friendship, disguised against the cruel backdrop of prison life.Emotional, harsh and pure genius!Should be oneverybodies must see list!",10
"Never has perseverance played such a strong character on film. The respect and friendship that came from it were against all odds, but to do so one would need hope. Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne manages that intangible saving grace over decades while falsely imprisoned and it's Morgan Freemans' Red who narrates for us and in constant perspective against the institutionalization of the Maine State penitentiary. The symbiotic relationship between the two is perfect cinema chemistry. The ending is quite fantasy, but makes for good afternoon drama on TNT who, I believe bought the rights for a cheep price, and that's a happy ending for Ted Turner!",10
"This film should not be(as many else films)in top 3 of the 250 best films ever made.First I want to say something about the acting, that is one of the things that makes this one so good.Morgan Freeman is fantastic and so is Tim Robbins(both of them are very good actors even if Freeman is better).The script is also fantastic and the whole complex of the film is brilliant.
It´s a film that might will bring you to tears, even if it in the end goes to far and everything becomes silly.I mean it could they could have cut out the last fifteen minutes but it´s still a frightening film.The message in the film are that you will survive as long as you have hope.4,5/5",7
Good movie that doesn't require a heroine. Classic movies are classic because they are all doing the same thing-letting you appreciate the beauty of hope from different perspectives.,6
"The Shawshank Redemption never made it to the big screen in Sweden, at least not what I heard of. And I really can't understand why. It is excellent. It's a calm and unsettling story of a man's (Robbins) life in jail, of the friendship between him and his fellow lifer, Red (Freeman) and the disgusting life in a corrupt prison in the 50's and 60's. Excellent performances, great camera angles and one of the very best endings of any film.Stephen King wrote the story. Why should I be surprised? His novels and short stories make for great films - but most are turned into crap, like It. This one, however, is one of the best movies there is.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie which is hypnotising in just how good it is. You know the type of film; whenever it's on TV (which in this case it constantly is) you have to stop what you're doing and watch it - one of those rare movies in which you don't want to end. With the all the movies out there in which you find yourself checking how long is left of the running time, here is one in which you see there is a whole hour left and you're glad; the mark of a truly great movie.Carcerophobia is the fear of going to prison and is something which has crossed my mind in the past, partially brought on by movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Even if you've committed nothing illegal like Andy Dufresne, there is always that possibility that an honest law-abiding citizen could end up in the slammer. The world of Shawshank State Penitentiary is one with little to no human rights, one with shocking but believable treatment from both the guards and fellow prisoners as they engage in brutal, sadistic acts. Regardless of what prisons around the world are like circa 2017, your ""whole life (is) blown away in the blink of an eye, nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it"". The Shawshank Redemption may be one of Stephen King's non-horror works, but the prospect of going to prison for a crime you never committed gets under my skin.One of the aspects of The Shawshank Redemption which intrigues me the most in the empire Andy builds while inside prison as well as an insight of the economics and commerce which goes on between the prisoners and guards. Just like Robert Stroud in Birdman of Alcatraz, he is still able to find meaning in his life despite being in what first looks like a hopeless situation; he is able to find hope in despair. This really does show that at the end of the day, knowledge is power. Likewise, Andy sending a letter every week to the state government for prison library funding and ultimately playing with the system, always something which inspires me.What makes Andy Dufresne such a great character? Like Tim Robbins himself, there is more than meets the eye. Robins has an intelligence to him and you can't quite figure out what is going on behind his eyes, an actor with a mysterious aura to him and this comes through with the character of Andy. He is not like the rest of the prisoners, he's a civilised gentleman thrown into the jungle that is prison but he's not a sheltered fool ether and knows how to deal with his new surroundings. But why do I need to tell you this, the narration sums up his character perfectly in a beautiful and poetic manner - ""I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over."" Likewise, I also find myself very intrigued by the character of Brooks; just how does such a gentle soul end up in prison? Did he really commit a crime? Who knows?Morgan Freeman has the ability to play wise old men without coming off as a stereotype or a cliché. His narration is describing what obviously appears in the film, so what makes it so great? Like the best film narration, it's to do with its poetic manner and the way in which it's delivered; scenes in the film were shot to time with the pre-recorded voice over plus it goes without saying Freeman has one of the most heavenly voices ever. None of his dialogue is necessary for the advancement of the plot, yet what would the film be without it? There are just so many inspirational quotes.The escape sequence itself so incredible yet at the same time is entirely believable and one of the most satisfying movie revenge plots. Many people always point out as to how Andy could reattach the poster to the wall when he begins his escape through the tunnel, even Frank Darabont acknowledges this on the DVD audio commentary although I am puzzled as to why this is made into a big deal. Andy could simply attach the poster to the wall at the top two corners and allow gravity to cover the remainder of the hole and simply crawl into it from below as if the poster where a curtain, likewise we never see on screen if the poster has been reattached on all four corners.When I think of films which can convey an expansive range of powerful human emotions and feelings and act as a form of emotional therapy a few instantly come to my mind - It's a Wonderful Life, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shawshank Redemption. Films which help one to break from the mental prisons of our life.",10
"Life is full of irrationality, but Andy strives to demonstrate his abilities in the worst of circumstances. He also demonstrated the ability to make a Prison Break. The scene at the end where Red takes Andy to meet him by the sea in Mexico was very moving. Beautiful blue ocean. All humans should be free and happy.",6
"Never underestimate America's fascination with outlaws and criminals. Few can forget that band of revolutionaries who founded this country. Theirs was a heck of a gamble, which, in the case of proving unsuccessful, would have found them all hanging gallows high. So it should come as no surprise that many members of present society find cause to cheer outlaws and criminals of every stripe. The more intellectually resourceful, inventive and philosophical these characters prove to be, the more they seem to charm their audiences. Perhaps this partly explains the appeal of PULP FICTION (1994), with its hit men playing a faux version of students of Life, pondering the verities of Divine Intervention and the unsuspected temporary triumph of the so-called strong over the weak before chaos overcomes them in the out-takes. The strangest things can re-enforce this original archetype of free thinkers pugnaciously operating outside the strictures of the known and accepted Law.Enter Tim Robbins as banker Andy Dufresne sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. Ostensibly guilty for the murders of his wife and her lover, he claims innocence and is sticking to his story. But what else is new? He's merely declaring the party line. Later in the narrative, Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate Ellis Redding, demonstrates that everyone in Shawshank can claim innocence, so he happens to be in good company.The relationship between Andy and Red is interesting to compare with that of John Travolta as Vincent Vega and Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield. I believe it was Roger Ebert who alluded to an echoing of the relationship between Huckleberry Finn and Jim in Tarantino's Indie masterpiece PULP FICTION (1994). You might also find it of value to compare the relationship between Max Durocher as played by Jamie Foxx and Vincent as played by Tom Cruise in Michael Mann's COLLATERAL (2004) for good measure. It might explain the appeal of these kind of buddy movies where one character is white and the other black.Now Huckleberry Finn was moving down a river of Space with an escaped slave called Jim on a raft, and at times this involved trading incidents about their life experience. Doing time together, Andy and Red find themselves riding down a river of Time toward a destination that appears to be unknown. Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield find themselves moving down a river of Time and Space past points of chaos to some kind of paradigm shift beyond their current professional duties. Tom Cruise's take on the philosophical assassin, also curiously named Vincent, is also moving down a river of Urban angst with Jamie Foxx as Jim to his Huckleberry Finn. Examine these pairings closely and you will see that the African American male tends to serve as the moral conscience for the tale while the so-called Anglo-American tends to do the kind of resourceful thinking that resolves the narrative. This is less true for PULP FICTION (1994), where Jules Winnfield does most of the quick thinking AND serves as the moral conscience for the piece, and this alteration of the paradigm is further echoed in Max Durocher's seismic relationship with his Vincent in COLLATERAL (2004).American society is so thoroughly saturated with the atmosphere of race consciousness that these kind of relationships between black and white males are a source of endless fascination and enormous appeal to audiences everywhere. White males traditionally demonstrate greater access to the machinations of a system primarily designed to favor them with opportunities, while the black males they are paired with tend to watch their backs, because, in the words of the immortal Sachel Paige, something might be gaining on them. It could be the hound dogs or the lynch mob or anybody else with their finger on the trigger.Morgan Freeman gently and gradually grows on you, narrating the story until he comes to a near hero worship of Andy Dufresne, but as you'll see when you get near the end; it is evidently not without good reason. Director Frank Darabont give a nice elegiac flow to the entire proceedings peopled with as fine a motley crew of character actors as you could ask from anywhere. These include William Sadler as Heywood, a long standing member of Red's gang, James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen, the elderly prison librarian, Clancy Brown as the brutal captain of the guards, and Gil Bellows as Tommy Williams, a young convict who gives and gets an education from Andy Dufresne. Bob Gunton as Samuel Norton, the sanctimonious warden of Shawshank prison, puts a supercilious smiley face on prison corruption, as Andy Dufresne finds himself reduced to playing ball and cobbling out his own chess pieces from rocks in the yard.Just as Andy and Red evolve a relationship between each other that one could consider harkens back to Huckleberry Finn and Jim, so too does the final convolution of plot startle and surprise us with its faint resonances to Alexander Dumas' novel THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. We recall later how Dumas the writer was mentioned earlier in the prison library. That being said, Morgan Freeman gets to utter one of the great lines in all of cinema before he enlarges his role to give us a taste of the Nelson Mandela he will play fifteen years later in Clint Eastwood's film INVICTUS (2009). Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne gets to join Freeman on the narration as the vivid cinematography of Roger Deakins and the hauntingly endearing music of Thomas Newman takes us out of the closing scenes. We are left with a lot to digest about the roles of fear and hope as it relates to the vindication of faith beyond the confines of Shawshank Prison...",8
A flawless film. But every time I watch it I still get upset that Thomas Newman didn't win the Oscar for his flawless score. And all of his others as well.,10
"To this point there's nothing i could say that would compare to this mindset of a man you'll think trapped by the circumstances of a false accusation, deprived of his own existence and forcefully barred against his own will, and one would even think as far as to say have no purpose as to the life he's been convicted to, more like there's nothing to live for, then a light in the dark came but the world around him was too cruel as to let it go, ladies and gentlemen boys and girls if you are reading this there's no better explanation to define the word HOPE than this, this is the light that will lead one to the conclusion that there's always a way and that's been my motto for as long as i can remember. It's like this I'll hope to get my wishes or hope to die trying, as long as there's hope fueling your every action in secret with an air of enigma, work till your hopes are realized, always remember one has to be flexible like Andy.",10
"Absolutely fantastic and worth a watch. Measured with its storytelling, compelling and twistful this is brilliant, the greatest rated film on this database and for a reason, highly recommend",10
"Before watching any movie, I do read reviews here and this is correct one as far as stars go. It is really engaging in a sense that although it is long, does not bore you. It is emotional and you are bound to shed a few tears. I don't know many movies with two main actors, but their roles here are very truthful to what may be real persons experiences. I loved the movie also because it does give you hope that injustices done by others to you will be - one day or eventually - 'paid' in a way or that something good is waiting for you after the hard times. Anyway, a story you can not simply not love. I may see it 20 years later, but it is universal movie. Go and see it",10
"Frank Darabont is no Orsen Welles.
This is a manipulative piece of garbage which has successfully fooled many people.DONT BE A SHEEP !! THIS IS A CRAPPY MOVIE ! PERIOD !!!",10
"I think the director did a good job and the writer wrote a good script. Through the description of Andy's prison life, this film reflects the society's discrimination against prisoners at that time. As long as once in prison, the prisoners are bad in their eyes, they can't turn over a new leaf. And the irony is that a lot of the people in Andy's prison were not guilty, they were just locked up as prisoners because of the immaturity of the legal system at the time and for a variety of reasons. They were tortured in prison and treated unequally. Sadly, many prisoners in prison become numb, lose their humanity and become sad because they stay in the same place for a long time. And Andy's presence changes everything in this prison. It also tells us that, like Andy, we should learn to change our perspective and learn to survive adversity. Besides, the film implies that our legal system should be improved. If a system or a system is not mature and perfect, there will be a lot of people to take advantage of the loopholes, and eventually may cause the chaos of the whole society.",4
It took a lot of patience to endure. I felt like I was in a prison of streaming. It was a series of humiliations and beatdowns followed by (surprise!) vindication. Painful. Truly.,7
"I love when stories provide all the answers towards the end of the film.Shawshank Redemption does exactly that and more.It has a feel good story, with amazing plots and twists, while also serving up suspense and entertainment.The filmmaking is tremendous, as well. And if I were to have a favorite scene in all of movie history, it would be when Andy falls out of the sewer pipe after crawling in filth to then scream in joy while rain pours on him. It symbolizes more than just escaping prison.
Such a beautiful scene.",10
"****Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gunton.The story follows Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully accused of murdering his wife, but he is really innocent.  He befriends a few prisoners, and then finds a way to escape the prison.The movie is one of the greatest movies of all time.  It has every single element that makes this wonderful.Very highly recommended.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a 1994 drama directed by Frank Derabont starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the leading roles. Movies based on the novels and stories of mastermind Stephen King enjoyed massive popularity for now almost half a century, some as critically acclaimed masterpieces (""The Shining"", ""The Green Mile"") and some as mediocre but cult classic flicks (""Pet Semetary"", ""Christine""). Although they never fail to entertain it's not always easy to predict where an adaptation ranges. In this case though, it's obvious.  I mean, could 2.2 Million other cinephiles be totally wrong? I guess not. This film definitely deserves the first spot. As a bookwork who loves the original short story it's satisfying to see how well adapted it is and how true it is to its source material. It had slightly different changes, but they were all for the better. I know, in the novella Red is a red-headed Irish man, but who would dislike a story narrated by Morgan Freeman? Additionally, he and Robbins performed outstandingly and acted together so well. This film is a melancholic and simultaneously hopeful journey of a falsely convicted banker and depicts how he manages to fulfill his dream of freedom. It's wonderfully filmed by the legendary and somewhat underappreciated cinematographer Roger Deakins and he really knows how to capture the devastation and the depressing tone of the story. Each and every brilliantly written character was spectacularly portrayed by their respective actor. Unlike other prison break movies this film addresses the dramatic and philosophical aspect of a lifetime sentence: What distinguishes an inmate from a human being? Of course most people commited a crime, but is it really necessary to take them in for a whole life? This film sensitively tries to answer these questions and shows us that although everything they have done, the inmates are still human beings. It's social criticism at it's finest, extremely emotionally shown through the story of Brooks. The ones who served their whole life in prison never get the chance to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. It's simply devastating to see at times, sometimes the brutality shows itself by violence and sometimes by unexplainable human behaviour. Despite all those prominent aspects this film also depicts the hopes and dreams of a man and inspiringly tells us that it's never to late to dream and that we as humans should never give up. All in all, this cinematic masterpiece lives up to its reputation and gives us an unforgettable experience that gives you goosebumps by its packing narrative and outstanding performances. This one of the best dramas ever made and will always be a milestone achievement in the history of cinema. Brilliant!",10
"I watched this movie for probably the third time last night. I am still fascinated at how it shows that patience, wits and doggedness can overpower brute force and injustice even after twenty years. The movie ends on a happy note, asserting that hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things, and it does give me hope personally. No evil, no injustice can last forever.",10
"Spoiler!! The philosophical ebbs and flows of The Shawshank Redemption make it the finest movie of the last ten years. Andy is a ping pong ball of hope and despair, of assimilation and rejection.  The same is true of Red, but the philosophical contrast between the two, and the way each is forced to consider the other's viewpoint, is why this movie's message is so poignantly delivered.Andy, in his earliest prison days, is a loner, whose hope that his nightmarish incarceration will not prove real delays his assimilatation into the culture and society of Shawshank.  Ultimately, though, while clinging to an inner belief that Shawshank is not home, he realizes that, in assimilation, lies his only hope of coping with prison life.Contrastingly, Red, a long-term inmate whose once-a-decade parole rejections have become a ritual reminder of the fact that he has no hope of getting out of prison, has assimilated to the fullest possible extent, and clearly views Shawshank as home.Each is frequently exposed to the viewpoint of the other.  Red expresses concern when Andy dreams of life in Mexico, but Andy takes exception when Red proclaims himself to be dependent on Shawshank for his livelihood. Red, in essence, suggests that Andy accept Shawshank as home.Red is selling despair and assimilation to Andy, but Andy is selling hope and rejection to Red.  When Andy escapes from Shawshank, Red's chance to sell Shawshank to Andy evaporates, but it's impossible to tell whether Andy has reached Red or not, and it appears that it doesn't really matter.The brilliant twist toward the end of The Shawshank Redemption is that it is the manifestation of his despair to the parole board that results in Red's parole.  Even in parole, however, Red finds despair in assimilation, the same despair that prompted Brooks to commit suicide some years earlier. Only when he reads the note Andy left for him in the hayfields of Buxton is Red presented with a chance to pursue a course of hope and rejection.Rejection, in this case, means parole violation, and results directly from Red's, seemingly unprecedented, hope for a happy life.  When Red acts on his impulse and travels to Mexico to, presumably, live out his life alongside the greatest friend he has ever known, he, finally, buys into Andy's philosophies about hope, despair, assimilation and rejection.
In doing so, he provides a happy ending to a film that may live on forever due to the criticality of its subject matter and its masteful delivery of its message.",5
"I think this movie is clearly a 10. To call it the second best movie of all time might be a bit over the top. However, it is impressive that it has got almost 120.000 votes. Anyway, I thought it was really interesting. Tim Robbins is a very good actor and so is Morgan Freeman. Anyway, there is one thing that annoys me, and that is the focus on what one might call ""transgression"". I mean the warden and sadistic prison guards - all this is a bit too far out I think and works to the movies disadvantage. The love of transgression is always followed by some kind of sentimental prejudice. However, that does not damage the movie as a whole. It's really an amazing story which keeps you guessing till the end.",10
"It is a little predictable, but with terrific moments involving Andy and Red. We don't know where Red got the poster. In fact, the word ""poster"" wasn't even in the conversation. I also knew who was going to kill themselves. The movie doesn't explain Andy playing music in a locked room on the record player and then going to the hole for it. There's also another character named Tommy who is important for Andy's character, but isn't interesting otherwise. Andy couldn't have gotten a new ID and birth certificate at the DMV with almost no clothes on. Where did he get the clothes after taking the rainy ones off? He couldn't have fit through that metal pipe, either.",10
"It's not hard to explain: The Shawshank Redemption does not require any critical thinking.And that, is how you get the highest rated film on IMDb.Yeah, sure, it's ok. It's got a decent story, the pacing is good, the direction is good, you got all the necessary elements to make a 7/10 film.But .. that's it. It doesn't have any memorable characters. It doesn't have any memorable scenes. I mean .. you could probably be easily impressed by the crawling scene, if you are new to films in general. There's literally nothing worth remembering in this film. The acting is .. ok, because it's the lowest effort an actor can put in. The dialogue is simplistic, the characters are pretty basic, with a very base appeal to them. Even the story is watered down, with Andy Dufresne, murderer in the book, innocent in the film. I am not particularly concerned with fealty to the book though, but by the fact that there is nothing to warrant a high score.Instead, what you get is the McDonalds of films. It's easy to consume, it doesn't offend anyone, everything is sacrificed to the scope of being truly average, mediocre, as middle of the road as it can be made.I don't care for this. I don't care for a movie that offers nothing.Give me a Gom-Jabbar. Give me ""i could have been a contender"", ""you come in my house the day of my daughter's wedding"", give me the shootout scene in Scarface, ANY scene out of The Big Short, the ""why ain't they shootin down the helicopters"" from Charlie Wilson, the Matrix world reveal, even ""charlie don't surf"". But how did THIS get a higher rating than Space Odyssey? Or Clockwork Orange?It's not hard to explain: The Shawshank Redemption does not require any critical thinking.And that, is how you get the highest rated film on IMDb.My vote: meh. 7/10
Brubaker did it better.",10
This movie so great and enjoyable. It has a gripping story. Not regret watching,9
"Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free. -- the shawshank redemption.Time will prove the value of classics, though at some point they will be misjudged and ignored.",10
I don't care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.Its a very good story with a great plot twist.,10
"Many years I didn't understand why this film is the top rated on IMDb because I didn't watch it. When I did it I wouldn't have any questions. You watch the film and you believe this story. Wondrous cast did the great work, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the best friends at films ever. Actors in supporting roles did their work great too.
So this film is really the best in the world.",10
"I watched this movie years ago, and still loved it.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite Drama movie ever. It is beautifully written and the acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and flawless. This was my first time watching this movie and I absolutely loved it. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.I found it surprising that Andy escaped Shawshank prison. I thought that he would get parole just like Brooks did, but I was wrong. The amount of time he spent planning his escape was undeniable and fascinating. Andy never lost hope. ""Hope can make a man insane"" is a powerful quote said by Red, but was quickly contradicted by Andy who wrote in his letter for his pal Red that ""Hope is a good thing.""After 40 years in Shawshank prison, Red finally was released. He realized that he has nothing in the outside world and misses his friend Andy. However, he did not commit suicide unlike Brooks, but honored the promise he made to Andy. Andy's quote ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" stayed in Red's head and motivated him to travel to Mexico and see Andy.The iconic shot of Andy with stretched arms and closed eyes in the rain was brilliant and symbolizes freedom. After 19 years in Shawshank prison he escaped and is finally free to do whatever his heart desires.The Shawshank Redemption is empowering and leaves the audience covered in thoughts about the strong message behind the movie. The message the movie conveys is that one should never give up and always have hope.I loved how the movie referenced the book ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas. While not having the exact same plot, the Shawshank Redemption and the Count of Monte Cristo both share similar aspects. For instance, in both the movie and book the main character escapes from prison.To conclude, this is by far my all time favorite drama movie and understand why it is the top rated movie on IMDB despite being a box office disappointment. For those who have not watched it, I recommend it due to the powerful friendship between Red and Andy. The Shawshank Redemption is in many ways an all time classic movie.",10
This is a great film. Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen.,10
"I don't know how many times I've seen this movie now but I expect I'll be watching it many more times.This installment of the Stephen King Adaptation Watch was always one to look forward to. Just a genius story and film with great performances throughout. None of the 'TV movie' feel that most other adaptations have had to date.It's a story about friendship, love, and - yes - redemption that's brilliantly told. Very moving in parts - ie Brooks and his struggles outside and demise ... and the ending, of course.Nothing more to be said. There's a reason it's right up there in the discussion of best film ever. Wonderful.100/100.",10
"Essentially, The Shawshank Redemption is about the survival of the human spirit---in a colossally adverse situation. The brutality and corruption which goes on in Shawshank Prison...never hits the viewer right between the eyes (like it should). Thats due to the calming tones of our narrator...Morgan Freeman. Mans in-humanity to man....is on full display here...and its this strange mix of violence, upright stoicism and high morality that makes for a heady brew. Lets not under-rate the narration of Morgan Freeman---this was a huge reason why this movie is now considered to be...a Classic. So, why did it bomb when it was released ? Maybe it needs a couple of viewings for all the gears to mesh (Who knows?) My major criticism , is that i thought the two leads needed to be a bit more edgy , a little bit more angry. After all ..they weren't Saints. However, the messages that most people take from this movie are positive (me included). I do not think its a Classic------but it sure is a powerful movie ... and a very good one.",1
Best Motivational movie of all time... Gold standard for Patience and Give it all...,9
"Such a boring MovieSaw this because I came to know this has IMDb highest ratingCan't guarantee if it releases in 2020 instead of 1994, if it would still be rated so high.",9

"*The Shawshank SPOILERS* In the early '20s, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a quiet bank employee, is arrested, tried and sentenced to life in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover, murders that he didn't commit.The calm man has to rough up really soon, in order to survive life in the Shawshank prison, but manages to develop a friendship with a fellow inmate called Red (Morgan Freeman) and to be employed in the contability office by the corrupt director of Shawshank, thus helping his escape plan...When I first watched this movie, a few years ago, I was so in awe that as soon as I got out of school (where me and my classmates watched it during a morning without teachers) I went and bought it.It's an instant classic, an inspiring movie, based upon a short story by Stephen King (!), marvelously written, acted and directed, and fully deserving of being owned.The Shawshank Redemption: 10/10.",10
"It deserve 8-9 stars in my opinion, but no way this better than godfather, no way this deserve to be the top movie ever made in history",9
"This movie for me will always and should be in the top 10 movies of all time and not just because of the actors who play the main characters I.e for me one of the greatest actors of my generation in Morgan freeman and an underrated actors in tim Robbins, clancy brown and even William sadler. The film itself is set in the fictional prison from the short story from the legendary writer stephen king called Rita Hepworth and shawshank redemption and good old Rita plays a role in the movie helping Andy dufresne escape the prison. The story is tim Robbins character sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. When he eventually settles into prison life he becomes friends with Morgan freeman's character 'red'. I feel this movie is a mixture of drama/comedy and good will to men. It's a film that will make you feel sad and happy throughout the movie and I believe as much is a credit to the directors but also to Frank darabont who was involved 'the green mile' and one of my favourite tv shows the 'walking dead' along with stephen king. The writing is so good that the movie is a gem and is so close to the viewers hearts. For me from the first time to even now watching this film it has me up and down with emotions and back to what I said is this movie is in my top 10 movies of all time. If you haven't watched this movie then your either not a movie fan or been living in a cave. I give this a rating of 10 of 10.",10
"A beautiful film.  I must have seen it twenty times.  No joke.  Thomas Newman's haunting musical score still touches me with every viewing.  This is one of those films that plays on TV almost constantly and yet you still find yourself watching it every time.  I guess its because of its epic scale and like a great painting you can find some new in it each time you view it.
Frank Darabont does a great adaptation of Stephen King's novella from his 'Different Seasons' collection.  I guess the theme of each novella in the book relates to the different seasons.  The quote 'hope springs eternal' is at the preface of the Shawshank section of the book and if you've seen the film you know hope is the movie's central theme.
Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins make a great pair in this, probably the best on screen pair since Redford and Newman.  See this film and you may become a Shawshank fanatic like so many other people.",10
"Throughout watching this movie (The Shawshank Redemption), I found it really enjoyable saying it wasn't my usual cup of my tea but I found it amazing.",1
No one can take away your hope in your mind. 19 years' waiting in the jail. Nothing is impossible.The movie showcase an intense passion to crave for freedom. The man utimately regain control of his life. Every single man on earth should live a life as the male lead does. A very encouraging film.,9
"Who said Citizen Kane? Who said Casablanca ?. You can keep your mouth shut, because friends, this is the best movie in history.
I can't understand how in 1994 a movie (Forrest Gump), also very good but inferior to this one, won several Oscars, including the best film.
Also that year was also Pulp Fiction, another that is above Forrest Gump.
The fact is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has it all.
A great script, based on the novel of Stephen King (the best novel of him, without a doubt), a relentless direction like that of Daranbont, a spectacular photograph that is accompanied by an impressive soundtrack, the editing is excellent and the performances are all magnificent, highlighting especially the always brilliant Morgan Freeman.
My friends, if you really want to see good movies, do not hesitate to see this movie, you will love it, I loved it and it will remain, at least for many years, my favorite movie.",10
"It's not the easiest thing in the world to describe with words how perfect THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really is.
                              Well, let's try. It won't take long, read other comments for closer details and views. This is a fantastic unforgettable movie where a banker (Robbins) gets his life changed, when he get a double life-sentence because of the murder of his wife and her lover. The first years gets to be a pure hell, he gets harassed, and he doesn't fit in. When he meet Freeman and his pals and starts a friendly relationship the movie starts up. Memorable and entertaining movie with big lifts by most of the fantastic cast. And this is coming from Stephen King?                               10/10",10
"I'm gonna start like this: The movie touched me and I think it is great, but it does have flaws.
First off: Good production, well casted and great acting, one of Freeman's best roles and setting, camera, costumes, props etc. have a high standard.
I think the plot was good, but for the most part predictable, nothing surprised me, still a smart and touching prison story.
Yet I caught myself doubting some parts of the happenings and sometimes the production looked too slick.
I don't think it's a 10 since there are small things I would've done differently, giving it 9/10 since it's still a great movie.",10
This is easily the best movie of the '90s.  Or maybe one of the best movies of the '90s.  Stephen King's sure does show us that he can make awesome books besides horrors.  He also made The Green Mile.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in this excellent movie.  they both should've won Academy Awards for this one.  Definitely.  I love this movie.  I must have saw this movie about 20 times.  It is as great as the critics say it is. The direction for this is amazing.Overall the whole movie is great and I am surprised that Stephen King made such a good novel.  I've made my mind for the best movie of the '90s. Rating 11 out of 10. (Best Movie of the '90s),10

"This survey proves that the American Film Institute's ""Top 100"" and Hollywood's ""Academy Awards"" are nothing but a fraud.  Like many others, I did not go see this movie in the theater because Forrest Gump was out at the same time, hogging all the publicity. What a shame.  This movie should have swept the Oscars for best picture, best acting (lead and supporting), best directing, best screenplay....etc.I simply could not believe it when I saw that the AFI Top 100 did not include this picture at all.  It is simply the best film ever made.  Given the highly different tastes of individuals, it is rare that you can ask friends and acquaintances what the best movie that they have ever seen is and consistently hear the response: ""The Shawshank Redemption.""  Everything, every scene, in this movie works.  With the exception of special effects (this film does not need them), this is the movie all others should be measured against.",1
"Contains minor spoilers""The Shawshank Redemption"" has a lot going for it. The cast and acting are absolutely top-class, the main characters (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) are very likeable and the ""bad guys"" (warden + guards) are really evil.In terms of story, I found this movie to be good, but not that special. It has some truly touching and emotional scenes, some good jokes and the twist at the end is surprising and satisfying. Also, you've GOT to admire the persistence and positive attitude of Tim Robbins' character: NOTHING gets him down, no matter what things happen to him, he always keeps believing in himself and fighting back in his own way. But overall, there also were some pretty dull scenes and prison movies cliches in this movie..things like the rapists or the old man with the bird, and the whole new guy/old wise mentor thing have been before. Also, the pace is a bit slow at times.All in all, this movie certainly was entertaining and refreshing, and it left me with a good feeling, but honestly, I didn't find it THAT special. At least not special enough to warrant a #2 position in the top 100. Oh well, it's all a matter of taste I suppose.***1/2 out of **** stars",10
"I went in to give blood- the staff was watching this.. needless to say several orange juices and cookies later I was still at the blood bank, laughing and crying with the staff.  This is a remarkable movie for its subtlety- I like the fact that no one ever knew Andy was digging a tunnel- I like how he tells his friend to look a certain place if he ever gets out- and I like the message of hope for those who feel hopeless. Stephen King outdid himself with the story and Robbins and Freeman do wa wonderful job with the script they were given. Just to see the words "" brooks was here"" and then ""so was Red"" add those little touches that makes a movie great. A movie that deserved more accolades.",7
"Masterpiece :-)
If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you're beyond redemption.",10
"I saw this film in 2020, this movie is not just a movie, there is nothing more I can write about this film.
This film will always have an impact on my life.",10
"The Plot is so good, i just watched this movie and my mouth was open the whole entire time.. So good",10
"Tim Robbins plays innocence man send to jail for his wife's murder. Morgan Freeman plays his closes friend in jail and forming an unlikely pair of buddies. They never give up the dreams of escape outside of prison. There are certain points you miss the first time watching the Shawshank Redemption. This movie does more that entertain, it make you think how something is planned.",10
"I was not born when this movie came out so I have just had the chance to watch this movie and actually appreciate it recently and I must say I can see why this movie is recognized as one of the best movies of all times. The movie generally gets across human emotion and the acting and directing of everyone involved makes this movie a brilliant show alone. Not only is the movie well made but the story of it is fantastic and certainly does not mess up Stephen Kings novel. Even in it's near 3 hour runtime it does not ever get boring (and this is coming from someone who comes from the add generation) and always has a story to tell. Everything in this movie is important about the storytelling, from the main story to even Brooks story of him spending 50 years in prison and then being released and realizing he is completely dependent on the prison and has become used to being enclosed in its walls.Overall, the film is a masterpiece and I am glad I got to watch such a fantastic film. It is certainly up there in terms of the best movie of all time, and even though I am a little hesitant to call it the best, I would definitely put it in the top 10. I give this movie 96%.",10
"This movie touched me, but I'm finding it hard to review.It is the story of a man who, after being convicted to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, still manages to find hope and a reason to live. We see him first come to grips with the way his life is, then we see him begin to see how he could change it for the better.It is full of memorable characters who each have something to share with us if we are willing to listen. It will make you angry when an injustice is revealed, it will make you smile at a small bit of good fortune and even the hardest hearted person would have a hard time not shedding a tear during certain scenes.Redemtion is possible and may be right around the corner!",1
"When I had finished watching the movie,I was excited and wanted to watch it again.Wheather the figures and details or the spirit that the music conveyed to.""Hope is dangerous"" Red had ever said,But Andy has always sticked to it.He didn't cry when he was thrown into prison though he was innocent. On contrary, he found ways to kill long time to escape. He helped the head of the prison do the illegal things in order to gain some freedom. He rebuilt a library and helped the other prisoners. All the prisoners liked him, for he helped them find hope again. Perhaps it was time to escape, in a lightening and thundering night, he escaped from the prison through the hole he had dug for twenty years . He was free eventually .
I like Andy ,for his talent and his wisedom . And the most important thing that I like is his spirit-never giving up.",10
"THIS is what movies are all about! A magnificent story, first-class actors, a superbly talented director, plus all the necessary attendant and supporting talents including set design, lighting, music, scripting, and all else that is required in the mix to create a masterpiece. Not a moment of the film is wasted, no segment too short or too long: it is all ""just right"". Who would have thought that a story about men in a cruel prison system could be developed into a memorable movie with many marvellous messages. May I single out one of my favourite actors, James Whitmore? I cannot imagine anyone else more suited to the role than he. In fact, the casting in this epic is remarkable: all parts ideally filled with class actors. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, is not one of my screen favourites, but it's impossible to find any fault with him, and somehow he puts his mark on the role and makes it his. Tim Robbins is perfect; each time I see this film, I appreciate his acting more and more. It's so easy to give Shawshank Redemption a TEN. Surely anything less would be an injustice? Yes, Virginia, there IS a Santa Claus !",10
This is the movie every director will be jelous for his entire life what more can I say,10
The narration kind of spoils it at times by reminding it's a movie. But it's Morgan's voice so it is okay.,10
"Most defiantly not 1 of the best movies/...
While in many ways presents things I...n A different light it's not that amazing... If you'd ask me... (without giving spoilers) the movie in general... humanizes prisoners much much more then most prison movies (a especially for the time and...)
and that's why I believe it snowballed so much attention and simply caught on
but at the end of the day it's not that original it's not that good... It's fine even a good movie but not a 10 or a 9 not even a 8....it's Unbelievably over rated...
you should watch it.... but after you do think before you rate go over the plot again and.... there's also a need to separate the ending from the movie it's self.... again at a closer look it's not that! amazing... good but over rated....",10
"A very good movie. It is possible that the men (adult males) will find this movie more appealing than women (adult females). Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very good performances. In particular, Morgan Freeman excels like he seems to always do in his movies. I can never get used to the type of character that Morgan Freeman plays because of his versatility of roles he has played. The movie, although not fast paced, draws you in and keeps you interested. I could have sat through an additional 20-30 more minutes of film. However, the movie appears to be of sufficient length. Quite to my surprise, the ending was not entirely predictable. Older children (10+ years) would also enjoy this movie. This is not a chick flick so boys don't bring your date to this one. OK to share with long term girlfriend or wife though. This move does not inspire romance nor was its intent. A good film to sit down with popcorn.",3
"How the hell did this get voted number one in the top 250? Meandering adaptation of a tight little King short. Typically hammy performances and so sugary you could drop it into the world's water system and everyone would go hyper.It's okay, as adaptations go, but there is soooo much better out there.Steev",10
"This very sophisticated and beautifully storytelling, the way a great movie is supposed to be.When I saw the trailers and clips from this movie when it was first released, I thought to myself; ""Yeah right, another self-conscious Oscar-nominated prison dirge with it's heart fastened firmly to it's sleeve"".  I expected it to be another ""worthy"" movie like CHATTAHOOCHEE or the usual 80s telemovie types.  It wasn't until I sat down and watched the tv release that i really got involved with the story.I particularly like the way the story has heart and feelings, but is not sappy or pretentious.  There is humour, pathos, tragedy, and irony in equal measure.  So if you're like me and usually don't like ponderous prison dramas, I reckon you should see this movie anyway, and you should  find that it's surprizingly refreshing storytelling.",10
"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. SpoilersIn many ways, I am more than a little shocked at the overwhelming popularity of The Shawshank Redemption. I am not in anyway saying that it is a bad film, in fact its a great film. However, I never thought Shawshank would appeal to so many people. It just seems odd that it has received over 112,000 votes (More than the Godfather) and it is #2 on the Imdb top 250 list. I do not think it deserves this high position but it is nice to see the film get alot of notice.Shawshank deserves high marks in these categories: Directing, Acting, Cinematography, and Writing. This was the debut feature for Frank Darabont and he chooses to let Shawshank unravel at a slow pace. This is the perfect choice for the film. It moves slow but it is nevertheless compelling. There is only one time when the slow pace actually interferes with the film.
Darabont also gets some highly impressive from his cast. Tim Robbins gives a strong, subdued performance. Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, does an equally strong job here. The chemistry between them is effective too. As strong as the two leads are, they do not outshine the supporting cast. All of them are excellent but two of them deserve to be singled out. James Whitmore gives a brilliantly moving performance. Bob Gunton also deserves mention as the warden in charge of Shawshank. Cinematographer Roger Deakins should be given a lot of credit. He finds the perfect mood for the film. Shawshank is not a colorful place at all. He creates a dreary atmosphere that fits the film perfectly. There alot of uses of the color, gray that is used to create this atmosphere.
I have heard a couple of complaints that the film gets a little preachy at times. I cannot find where it does. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is a well-written film. There are numerous memorable quotes.Shawshank does have one flaw. I think it begins to drag near the end. This happens after Morgan Freeman is released from prison. These moments are the only times when the slow pace interferes with the film.
While I do not think the film deserves its high spot on the 250 list, it is a compelling and moving film. Shawshank does enough things right to overlook its sluggish ending. I recommend the film to everyone.",10
"He Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.

Andy finds it tough goi",1
I wouldn't even take the time to write a review for this other than the fact it is #1 on IMDB. This movie is a pretty average movie with good build leading up to a good ending. And that is the only word I would use. Good.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption follows a group of prison inmates as they serve out their sentences.This film is nothing short of phenomenal and I can see why it is considered among many as the greatest film ever created. My favourite two kinds of films consist of crowd pleasers and deep dive dramas that focus on certain lifestyles. This film fills both those slots. We get to see how exactly prison affects people and everything that is involved with being a prisoner. We also get some great moments towards the end that put a smile on your face every time you watch it.Across the board incredible acting, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both give probably their greatest performance, along side the rest of this perfect cast.Tim Robbins character Andy Dufresne gives us the angle of an innocent man entering prison, but not just an innocent man an intelligent innocent and I'll get to why his intelligence is so important later. We get to see Andy go through different stages of prison as we see what happens to people that are alone in prison, how they get targeted out by rapists and how they are treated with zero respect. Then we get to see what happens when you have something to offer the guards and the warden, in Andy's case it's is knowledge of banking. We see Andy begin by helping guards set up savings accounts and help them with their taxes all of which help him get in good with guards. But eventually we get to see how certain guards or in this case the warden may be worse then the people imprisoned. Warden Norton played by Bob Gunton recruits Andy to help him launder money, but once Andy has a chance at getting out the Warden makes sure he can't leave by killing the person that could lead Andy to freedom. This again gives us a great angle into what goes on in these prisons and how guards and wardens take advantage of their authority since they know inmates can do nothing to stop them.We don't find out until the end of the film but throughout his time in prison Andy has been digging a hole to escape, which really adds another layer onto why he does the things he does. Andy has been attempting to make the lives of these inmates better so when he eventually escapes he doesn't feel guilty for leaving his friends in a unsafe environment. We see him build up a large library as well as teach certain inmates so they can receive their high school diploma. Then at the end Andy is responsible for the arrest and 'almost arrest' of the warden and captain hadley.Another side of prison we get to see are the prisoners who have essentially spent their lives in prison. Red played by Morgan Freeman has become somewhat of a tycoon in prison, as he is one of the people that smuggle into the prison. By the time Red is released he had spent 40 years in prison and isn't accustomed to life outside, so when he is released and begins working he realizes that he is not meant to be outside of prison.Another character in this film had the same revelation. Brooks Hatlen played by James Whitmore was released from prison earlier in the film but when he had that revelation he committed suicide. Red on the other hand was lucky enough to have a friend like Andy. Before Andy escaped we get to see him give instructions to Red on where to find a rock, and under that rock is where Andy had hidden something. Under that rock was a letter to Red explaining where Andy was and that he would love to have his help with a new project of his. That is when we get to see the two reunite in a very satisfying conclusion.10/10.",4
"This movie was almost flawless perfection. A couple of really small things bothered me about it though...1. If he dug a hole in the wall it would have led to the adjacent cell... not some long ass tunnel that leads to outside. Like, hello??2. It was a little too slow for me. I understand that movies back then were slow but they sort of really dragged it out here.Overall though, this was a very well made movie. The story was great. I don't know if it deserves to be the best rated movie of all times because there are other movies that are better but it's definitely up there.",10
"Tim Robbins gives the performance of a lifetime as Andy, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife and her lover.  He is an unconventional prisoner who forms a friendship with Red, played brilliantly by one of the greatest actors of his generation, Morgan Freeman.To give away any more of the story is a crime, because this is an incredible movie that needs to be seen by everyone.  I give ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a 10 out of 10.",10
"I saw this film back in high school after having read Stephen King's novel. I fought to give this film a nine, but the more I think about it, this is absolutely a ten film. It may not be my personal favourite movie, but I really enjoy it. If I see it playing on television I have to stop and watch. Shawshank Redemption is all about hope which is expressed by Andy. The twists and turns that play out keep you entertained for the entire runtime with a message no one will soon forget. I for one quote the movie all the time. It's absolutely brilliant and the epitome of film structure.",10
One of the greatest movies ever. An outstanding story presented at the right pace.,10
"Recently on cable television, this classic movie has stirred the hearst of many.  It is a very compelling film, and it arouses one's emotions to their zenith.  The casting is perfect, the performances are the penultimate of theatre, and the result is a must-see drama that belongs in the DVD library of all serious collectors.",10
"Brilliant movie,I'm so glad I can see on a big screen at cinema. Marvellous and how interesting,also the cast just a fab . Highly recommended to watch",10
The film that fit for perfect cult classic. All time number one. After watching this my favourite movies are gone from my brain. I seen 3 times in one week but still that is attracting. A must must watch.,10
It was one of the best films I saw and it should be seen with a very special understanding and accuracy,1
"Just watched again after 30 years, and I have to say what a great movie this is. Almost a 10 from me and if I could and an extra half star then I would.",10
"Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. Be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting.The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning the state of our justice system. We lock away these ""threats to society"", alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms, we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful story. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every human emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time.A truly amazing film, 10 out of 10 from me!",8
"I like the story and actors the play role great.
and great ending.",10
"It's rare to see a film in which every individual actor would be able to be a leading character. This story truly couldn't have been told any better. Every scene held meaning, and every scene made the audience feel some type of way emotionally, it's really rare that a film can do that.Overall, 10/10.",1
"I am really glad that stupid people didnt ruined this movies score.The Shawshank Redemption have a great story and 2 huge actors that made their roles flawlessly. The story made everything in this movie, EVERYTHING.If you didnt watched until now... what are you waiting for?",10
This is the real example of extreme courage and hope.Every damn thing regarding this movie is outstanding.The story is exceptional. Narration and script was tight and engaging.This type of a gem can only be made once in a lifetime.WOW movie!!,10
"Superb movie , good relaxation movie, climax is too good , movie goes very realistically,awesome movie",10
"This is one of those rare films that actually exceeds the book by which it was based upon.  It's that good.  Not only is this a damn good  flick, it actually made me a fan of Tim Robbins and told me what I already knew about Morgan Freeman; He's one of the best actors alive.  I really can't say much more.  This is one of my favorite movies ever and there is no way that I can make that point any clearer.  If, for some reason, you haven't already seen this, go get it now!!!  If you don't, you're seriously depraved.  What a movie!!!!",10
"An amazing piece of film. Penned by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, this one sneaks up on you, takes you to the lowest place of the human spirit then takes you in the exact opposite direction. Totally snubbed by the Oscars, but one of the greatest films of all time. Told in the narrative style, conducted by Morgan Freeman, we get a picture of the prison system of the 1940s-1960s and some of the wildly unique characters who inhabit the walls of Shawshank Prison. Shawshank, is a frequent and oft referenced institution of many of Stephen King's stories (both written and on screen) and every time i hear the name in any of his works it makes me think of this story.",10
"You know some birds are not meant to be caged,their feathers are just too bright.",9
Really good movie. I like it and I wasn't bored while I'm watching it. And I ever never watched movie looks like it.,1
"**** SPOILERS HEREIN**** proceed at own risk!!!!!it is simply no wonder that shawshank redemption is as insanely popular as it is. the movie is the greatest flag-bearer for hope and the determination. i have been wanting to see this movie for a long time and recently caught it on television as part of a stephen king horror special series!!!!the movie begins at quite a slow pace and after about half an hour i was wondering why this movie was so highly rated. but slowly the movie unravels and soon i was totally caught up in its brilliance. sometimes harsh, sometimes serene, sometimes wishful, sometimes dreadful. the intensity of the despondence at shawshank prison is almost tangible.tim robbins and morgan freeman are outstanding in their roles. each character is brilliantly etched and is a delight to watch. the screenplay is the highlight of the movie and there is always a feeling of something larger lurking behind the damp grey walls of shawshank.for those who have seen the movie, an interesting point would be that the name of stephen king's novella is ""rita hayworth & the shawshank redemption"". well well!!the movie though has to be watched. it is an experience every human should go through. it takes the light at the end of the tunnel to the next plane.an elevating 10!!",9
"I would by lying if I had to rate this film less than 8/10 but then if I was asked ""what's so great about it?"" I would have to reply ""well, nothing really - it's just a good film"".I very much doubt that anyone who looks critically at movies can really see this as anything more than a really good made-for-TV movie. It's like the Bjorn Borg of movies: you can't fault it but what else is there to it?We need more ""McEnroes"" and ""Agassis"" with flair and style which go beyond what we expect from movies that are simply good.Mungflesh Factor 8/10",10
"I missed this when it came out, and probably wouldn't have gone even if I had heard about it. I expected this to be what ""The Green Mile"" was. That is, I thought it would be heavy-handed, pretentious, self-consciously high-minded, and boring. It is anything but these. It's an engrossing story and very entertaining story of two men and how they overcome their past lives. Freeman and Robbins give wonderful performances, and the supporting cast measures up. There are plenty of funny moments in the film, and the ending is intensely satisfying. It is a great movie.",10
"I don't think this film is the number one of all time.  But than, it might be.  I placed Casblanca and The Godfather higher because they haven't dated. Let's see how well the Shawshank Redemption does in twenty years.  That said, this movie is a staggering experience.  While I didn't experience it in theatres, I was impressed by the cinematography.  The performances are uniformly flawless.  I can't believe that Hawthorne beat out Robbins to a nomination.  The direction and story also make this magnificent.  But what makes it moving, is it's theme.  In the end, it's about hope.  Not an 'action' quality, but an important one.  It doesn't preach, but teaches.  The music score still haunts me.  I rank it as number one of 1994, and one of the best of the decade.",4
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an uplifting movie about hope. What I got out of the movie is that as long as you have hope you will always be O.K., I felt good after watching this movie, it puts that sense of hope inside you. I was actually cheering during the scene where Andy finally escaped from prison,it was a very unique moment. This is a film that anybody can watch and anybody that does watch it it will touch them in a special way, I guarantee it.",10
"Yep I have to agree with so many others. I am a movie fan who usually watches about 5 a week on average. I actually keep track of every movie I watch in my own personal data sheet. This one is at the very top of my list.No movie I know of has better character development than The Shawshank Redemption. The movie has a few challenging scenes but most of it has a relaxed, even attractive quality to it. Just about anything Morgan Freeman does is good for me. I just can't help but like that man.I too thought this was Tim Robins' best role.I enjoyed the revenge component and somewhat happy ending even though it may have been a bit of a stretch.Great stuff. Good movie making. Good story writing. Great screenplay. Cinematography was appropriate. I felt like I was there with them.",10
"No wonder this movie is on second place in the top 100 movies here on imdb.com This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time and i still haven't met anyone who doesn't love it as much as i do. And if i do i will probably look at them funny and ask what is wrong with them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both excellent in this ""innocent man wants his freedom"" movie. This film is about friendship, freedom and justice. A man is sent to Shawshank prison for something he didn't commit. Here he meets a man who will become his best friend. They stick up for each other against the corrupt prison system and other inmates. You really have to see it to understand how fantastic this movie is. I rate this movie 10",7
Some movies are just greatly made and meant to be great. Shawshank Redemption epitomizes this greatness. In every respect this is movie you can watch over and over again and still feel absorbed by its intrigues. Few movies come this close to perfection. Definitely a 10.,10
I get lost in watching a great movie!I should have written this review years ago but.time works differently for everyone and we all have priorities so it's not too late anyway.,10
"It's not the easiest thing in the world to describe with words how perfect THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really is. Well, let's try. It won't take long, read other comments for closer details and views. This is a fantastic unforgettable movie where a banker (Robbins) gets his life changed, when he get a double life-sentence because of the murder of his wife and her lover. The first years gets to be a pure hell, he gets harassed, and he doesn't fit in. When he meet Freeman and his pals and starts a friendly relationship the movie starts up. Memorable and entertaining movie with big lifts by most of the fantastic cast. And this is coming from Stephen King? 10/10",10
"You gotta watch this movie, don't waste your time looking for another one. Trust me",10
"Great lead performances by Robbins and Freeman. An outstanding supporting cast, fine cinematography by Roger Deakins, well-chosen shots by editor Richard Francis-Bruce, a haunting musical score by Thomas Newman, and a well-realized adaptation of the short story by Stephen King as adapted and directed by Frank Darabont.  
What still amazes me about the overall positive response to ""Shawshank"" on the IMDb is how it touched viewers years after it was released into theaters. I saw the movie in the theaters after it received a few weeks after the Oscar nominations were announced. I was blown away by the movie then and it still gets to me now.",10
One of the best movie in the world.goldfields gorkhdhanda chekan Sisodiya doshala chelsi.,1
"This is an absolutely beautiful movie. I'm not so sure if it deserves to be the number one movie on IMDb, or how exactly it wound up there, but that aside I do really love it. You really feel for Andy and the rest of the prisoners in this movie. It's a shame to see the warden and prison guards having the power that they do over the inmates, especially since they are crooked, foul individuals.One great scene is that of Brooks after he is released. I can still remember the letter that he was narrating while it played out. Very nicely done. There are many memorable lines throughout this movie, many of which deal with hope which is a nice thing to hear about. The finale when you find out that Andy had been tunneling out for twenty years was a very powerful one. It was amazing to think about how it was accomplished and how he never gave up hope.The story really drives this film and the script is terrific. The performance and characters are top notch and this movie should definitely be seen by anyone who is a fan of movies.",10
"The classics in classics are really amazing. Whether it's the plot, the meaning of the expression, the lens settings, the actors' acting skills, the music rhythm, etc. are so perfect. I was deeply impressed by the first time I saw junior high school. It's been a long time since then. ""Hope is good, maybe the best in the world, and good things never die."" I remembered the original lines in the film for a long time, and it was with me that inspired me to spend some time.I couldn't stop thinking excitedly, free people would be so excited, free people on an unknown journey. I want to cross the border successfully, I want to shake hands with my old friend, and I want the Pacific Ocean to be as blue as a dream.",1
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a good movie, but there are definitely a number of disconcerting aspects to it, such as foul language and violence. It takes a lot in a film to actually offend me. I'm a reviewer, so I have to tell what I thought about the movie. Very foul language does tend to bother me a bit, because it gives all the characters of this movie a self bad image, in addition to that, the Bible says `Do not let your mouth coarse foul language because it involves sinful speech'. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" could have been better, but we hear very bad words and an overdrawn narrative throughout the whole movie. Spoilers: This movie is mostly about a man who is in jail and has to face evil people including the mayor who wants to make his life miserable, but he's very smart and gets ahead in life by trying to break a wall with a hammer to escape from jail! Probably this movie moved many people simply because the main character (Tim Robbins) was intelligent and brave, however the whole movie doesn't tell much, only the main character's life in jail and his effort to get rid of it by hope and boldness, which I didn't find very annoying! The ending was somewhat farfetched and predictable, in addition to that we never knew if the man who killed the main character's wife was punished, however I thought that this movie leaves an interesting message at the end which is to have hope when everything seems impossible. 7/10",2
"I'm not going to spoil or tell you about the scenario of this movie but i'm really excited to review about the lessons i benefited from this masterpiece ,This Movie is a real gem , teach you lots of lessons about life and how bad it can hits you , The movie shows you various kinds of lessons and thoughts and how can you treat them positively , I'm gonna enumerate some of them , first is the real man is the person who can withstand a long term storm and keep going on , second it tells you never miss any opportunity even when it seems dangerous , all you have to do is embrace it , third is knowledge always rescue its seeker , fourth is hard times reveal your real friends who can sedate the pain that hard time give you especially when we're talking about the prison time , fifth is leave your own print in every place you attend just to give a sign or evidence for next visitor that you was there , sixth patience will achieve more than our force so always be patient not hasty and wait for the right time to come , and the last and the greatest quote from this amazing movie is ""Get busy living, or get busy dying "" .",9
The screenplay for Jay makes your brain tickle and it keeps your mind busy for a long time,10
"I am at a loss of words to describe the greatness of this film, and by all means I give full credit to the book that it is an adaptation of.Half way through the film I began to enjoy the capabilities of the man and begin to see all that as the point of the film, but then it slows down in pace a bit (for the final ""assault"") and I end up asking myself the purpose of it all, but then the ending leaves me speechless!This film, alongside the Bollywood biopic 'Manjhi - The Mountain Man' (2015), are two great examples of the fact how time is of little value when there are no better alternatives to achieve your goal. Often in our life we deny to take certain steps which might help us in achieving a goal in some years, but exactly after spending as much time sitting mum, we reflect on the time spent and regret not having taken those steps in all these years.A maternal cousin of mine from Denmark visited us in the summer of 2012 and he mentioned this film in a lot of conversation. Sadly, I wasn't too much into Hollywood films yet. Now that I am since over 15 months I checked the IMDb list of top 250 films and found this on the first place. I was immediately reminded of my cousin and thought that he wasn't after all just randomly naming a film. It was very clever to have shown Andy as innocent. This makes the viewers get more engaged into his suffering in the prison. The scene where he goes to his room with the rope, you almost find yourself saying in heart how this will be great injustice and something very, very sad and depressing.Again, all in all, this film is out of this world. One of the best of all times.",10
"I love this movie. Its so cool. Its uniqueness, the storyline and action is on point. I really recommend others to buy and watch this badass movie.",6
"I Can't believe it....
The director just suprise me.
Its a shame that such great move couldn't won even an oscar!!!!",10
I watch it all over again & again & enjoy it as it is the first time. It is very humane & full of life & philosophy.,10
This is one of the few titles that grows better with age and will be in almost everyones DVD collection.,10
"A big part of this film's appeal is the interplay between Thomas Newman's soundtrack and the simple yet profound dialog. The CD score stands up as a great work on its own. It alternates between brooding piano and powerful orchestration, with a few oldies added for context.Three scenes, named by corresponding tracks, are especially poignant. The first is ""Brooks Was Here,"" followed by ""Zihuatanejo"" and ""So Was Red"" (that title carries over from the Brooks track). To me, the third is among the most moving sequences in film history. You can't top Morgan Freeman saying ""Get busy livin'..."" as the inspiring music plays in the background.",7
"This movie is honestly one of the greatest movies ever made. This has been said so many times by so many people but it's true, this movie is genuinely good, nothing overrated, nothing boring, nothing bad about it. The movie is very emotional and has a great story and meaning to have hope. The movie is entertaining all the way through, wondering what will become of the character? Will he escape? Die in prison? Get free?. The movie is very good and has a really good ending. Masterpiece 10/10.",10
Almost every one with good movie taste would love this movie. Just a grat imagination by a actor of fooling everone in order to vet rid of jail. Brilliant acting with very strong story line. Just a masterpiece,10
"An excellent adaption of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"".Morgan Freeman is outstanding and his narrative is very lulling and makes the film all the more compelling.Tim Robbins, too, gives a fantastic performance - and the supporting cast (particularly Bob Gunton as the sadistic warden; he also appeared in the King adaption ""Dolores Claiborne"" (1995)) give fine performances, too.Despite being riddled with prison cliches, this movie is great.And remember: FEAR CAN KEEP YOU PRISONER, HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE.",10
Morgan Freeman is a tremendous actor. Everyone did a amazing job,10
"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"", starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Plain and simple. The film tells the involving story of two prisoners at Shawshank Prison, and their decades together under the thumb of a cruel warden and his henchman. Andy (Tim Robbins, never better) is an innocent man, who uses his accounting skills to make himself useful to the warden, and struggles to keep up hope, against the counsel of his fellow inmates. Red (Morgan Freeman, astonishing) thinks hope is a dangerous thing, and is an institutionalized man, who can't imagine life outside of the prison walls. The film also stars Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, and, in a powerful performance, James Whitmore. I'll say no more, because this film must be seen to be understood.",6
"I've seen this movie recently on my TV and it really is one of the most underrated movies of all times for its time. It's become such a classic movie that we love to see on TV.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were elevated to the top with this movie. Their performances really is the thing that should be taught in film schools about how to build character interactions and character development.Loved this movie, I recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it.",6
"Morgan Freeman as Red was truly inspired (even if the original story had a white guy), they even used his son for the photo of the inmate as a young man...Tim Robbins as Andy DuFresne was marvelous understatement, Clancy brown as the on/off guard-friend of Andy was a good touch and a boost for his career apart from Starship Trooper... Now, Clancy is in HBO's ""Carnivale"" series and has his own website! As for the warden and ""sisters,""  they were equally well-cast and the plot of the movie flowed despite what fan-sites may or may not nit-pick about.It is a tribute to perseverance and determination combined with patience and retribution couched in careful long-term planning that any true financial head is accustomed to (remember, Andy was a Bank Manager, that knowledge saved him more than once)...Justice sometimes comes from beyond the law if you can wait long enough! This picture is second after ""Casablanca""!!",10
"Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie.It's directed good,acted good,written good and it definitely deserved a few Oscar's.There is no doubt about it.It also deserves to be on IMDb's 250 list,as it is.However,i must say that it's very,very overrated on IMDb.Even though it's a great movie,it's still far,far away from being the best one!All of you who haven't seen this movie-should see it.But please don't believe in IMDb's rating's!If you do you might be disappointed because even though this is a great movie it's still not even close to being the best one! There is a lot of movies better then this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10
Closer to perfection than any movie has a right to be.,10
"It was genius, heartfelt, perfectly acted and overall a masterpiece",5
"Not sure why this is on the top, it's a meh good nothing more, godfather has elements of greatness, interesting plot, dark knight undoubtedly has those but shawshank is a movie that can easily be forgotten, good performance from Morgan, but I really can't point at anything special.",10
"Forgivness is releasing a prisoner, and realizing that prisoner is you. This movie might be the best movie that I have ever seen. You will laugh, you will cry, you will want to hug somebody.

"One of the best movie I have ever seen
Without Freeman this movie wouldn't have been that special .",8
"This film is one of those you would like to keep and watch over and over. Not a typical jailbird flick. Rather a story about struggle and overcoming and greatness. A happy end in this one feels true and believable although it wasn't necessary.Another interesting thing is that none of the characters in it is made to be hated. No classical ""bad guys"". Everybody here serves a certain purpose to the story, thus directing the fate of protagonists.I couldn't believe it was Steven King who wrote this. I generally don't like his stories, but that should obviously go for his sci-fi novels only. They all start well but finish ridiculously. However, it turns out that the man also penned ""the Green Mile"", another story that became a film that left a true impression. Gotta stop berating Steven King.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film, thanks in part to its suburb acting, incredible writing and direction from Frank Darabont, who acquired the rights to this story long before it became a film. Despite its poor initial box office performance, the consequence of being released alongside titans like Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, it still went on to the Academy Awards with seven nominations. At times it may feel like there's no hope in Shawshank, but the film counteracts those moments with an ultimately uplifting story. There are laughs, tears and shudders throughout all 2+ hours, all of which I view as a testament to self worth and never forgetting your own truth. In these tough times we're in, you will find that The Shawshank Redemption can inspire and comfort you.",10
It's one of the five best movies ever made. It's that simple. If you haven't seen this movie you're doing yourself a disservice. This movie should be required by law to be viewed by everyone. Maybe it will awaken the Marvel fanboys and they'll see what a real movie is. Perfection *chefs kiss*,9
"Like i get it, i do. BUT it is not an 9.2 it's barely a 9, 8 at most. You may ask why that is, firstly Tim Robbins's performance was mediocre the only actor who really shined through was Morgan Freeman and that's just because of his charm. The directing was not interesting and the whole feeling from the movie is very hollywood like, you know not real.",10
"There are some things in this world which are beyond those 26 Alphabets. We cannot always accurately explain or express them. So, Instead we should experience them. We should admire the beauty and creativity involved. This movie is really one of those things. You should experience this yourself. Worth of your time for sure !!!",10
"After 24 years, watching this Tales of the Prisoner adaption from Stephen King novel in 1994. A brilliant and masterpiece film from Hollywood. This movie also banned from release in cinema in Malaysia due to the prior excessive content. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman just nailed it. This movie is still the first in top rated IMDb movies.",8
"This film was good, don't get me wrong, but in a million years it would never have occurred to me that this film would rank # 1 in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 films [ I hope this doesn't last - it's april 1999]. It is ridiculous.  It is a good story, has good acting/character development, medium cinematography/music/everything else etc.....As enjoyable as any other half decent film - but not number one in MY top 250 - probably not even in my top 250.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic triumph that tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully imprisoned for murder. The film expertly explores themes of hope, friendship, and perseverance in the face of adversity. Tim Robbins delivers a powerful performance as Dufresne, while Morgan Freeman's narration adds an extra layer of depth to the already rich storytelling. Director Frank Darabont's attention to detail and masterful pacing keep the audience engaged from start to finish. The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film that continues to captivate audiences nearly three decades after its release.",9
"I have nothing but praise for THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  It is touching, high-spirited and full of motivation.  Tim Robbins plays a banker who is wrongly convicted of the murders of his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced to life in prison and eventually befriends another lifer (played by Morgan Freeman in a powerful role) who has just been denied parole.  It may sound like a simple story, but Frank Darabont's direction, along with endearing performances and a cheerful climax, makes the film so energetic and magical. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a breath-taking masterpiece.5 out of 5",1
"The day Hollywood tries to remake this, will be the day I never watch another film. It was wrenched and probably an understatement they tried it with ""Jacobs Ladder."" This movie is a gripping, well told story, that can't be touched. It is one of my all time favorite movies! If you have never watched it go do so now! Very few movies even come close to it's caliber. It is hard to find a single thing wrong with this All-time classic! I should have wrote this review years ago. I saw it at a very young age and was mesmerized. This is one film that truly deserves all the high ratings! I love the narration and everything that went into it. 10/10 stars.",10
"""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free."" What a great tag line. It makes you think of how good your life is when you get to be free.It is hard for me to put my feelings into words because ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of that kind of movies that makes you think. The movie has been very educating for me.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not an ordinary prison-movie. It is an epic story about friendship. I almost start to weep when I think of Red (outstanding Morgan Freeman) and Andy's (excellent Tim Robbins) strong relationship! In the film Tim Robbins' character, banker Andy Dufresne is being accused to have murdered his wife and his lover while they were having an intimate moment. The jury finds the defendant guilty as charged and Andy is sent to the infamous Shawshank prison which was known for its cruel punishments for misbehaving. While being a new meet in prison Andy is being harassed by the Sisters, inmates who want to taste some of that fresh meet. Everything happens on Red's point of view. Red is the guy who can get almost anything you want by smuggling stuff in. He is a provider who will someday give Andy the key; Rita Hayworth.The film is full of injustice but even if you are locked up you can find your soul-mates. Also after being imprisoned for a long time it will grow on you. It becomes your home. But not for Andy. He knows he's innocent. Maybe the Shawshank isn't so hard to crack...""The Shawshank Redemption"" is based on a short story by no other than king of horror Stephen King. I have found his prison-movies to be very very good because, well, the pictures about his stories have always been little downbeat. Maybe because of the supernatural side, I guess. I have this short story on my bookshelf and it's almost as same as the movie. The only thing's that different in the short story is that Red was a ginger-haired, white Irishman. Freeman's Red is also Irish but we all know the difference. It doesn't make any difference, really.The lesson of this movie is to never give up hope. Life can sure kick you but kick back. Be smarter than life.""I hope I can get across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope that the Pasific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope."" -Red",10
"What words can describe such a great film as this . Limitless yet I only need one to compare this film to da Vinci's Monalisa, with such art that the generations to come will still be talking about this film , dissecting it to see what worked for many of us cinema bugs..Tim Robbins' greatest role is here in this film , unsurpassed and for Morgan Freeman , the thunder who never strikes twice at the same place , it is also here. What will you do if you were convicted of a crime you did not commit ask yourself ? I for one, most likely would not have survived as long as Jake and the bird, or any of the wayward pack , yeah boy, do we admire them for their tenacity against the abusive guards, and please remember that this film is set on an era where the inmates and the internal guvs are not as thuggish like it is now for the last 25 years and so, maybe if retold in the modern settings no one would have survived , escaped , got pardoned and let alone rebuild their lives. It is as touching as it can be , as marvelous as real gold in your hands and as clever as you would like it to be. Definitely in my to watch again and again list.",9
"A movie without heroine, love and special effects. A movie that many college teachers like to show to their students is also a movie that you can never get tired of watching. It tells a pure but difficult story, a redemption in exchange for freedom. It is also a kind of support of faith. This movie makes a lot of people grow up and encourages a lot of growth paths.",9
"This is my perception of the entire film. As long as people exist in society, they will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. Of course, there are good and bad, but these are not the content we want to entangle. What really should be done is that no matter what, you and I will not be the former self.",10
"The story of a group of prisoners, one of which has been wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife & the man she's been having an affair with.He starts off by getting bullied by the prison thugs but that soon ends after he gets a job helping the prison guards & warden with their tax returns & other financial things.He then comes across a fellow prisoner who confesses to him that he knows the guy who really killed his wife & her lover & so he then confides in the warden for help finding the real killer but the warden refuses & confronts the prisoner who confessed with grave consequences.The main character then realises the only person that's going to help him is himself so he completes an escape plan he's been working on all along with a view to meeting up with his best friend should he ever be released.A great film that's well worth watching if you haven't seen it already, great storyline with great characters!",8
"One of the best movies ever made. The ending truly is something most people love about this one, me included.",10
"Still wondering! It's been past 2 weeks of watching this movie and I am still wondering, collecting scenes, dialogues of this movie. This is how this movie is going to impact you.
Gun in your hand, all evidence point you and you are declared a murderer but within you know you have not actually committed it. Law see evidence and you, Andy is behind bars of Shawshank, a prison. Your all freedom is within the bars now. An intelligent banker, Andy goes through all trouble in Shawshank. But you are unusual, you will think on how you can be free again, whereas your other mates think of living or dying in prison. A good man Andy the convicted starts his journey in jail, writing to government for fund to improve library in jail. Brings a different transformation in jail by educating uneducated. Tiredlessly writing to US Govt for more fund, impressing the warden of jail by filing tax return, advising on taxation, expenses and even children education. Helps the jail Warden and Jailor make millions by creating a false person with id in case FBI or other interrogates the money stuff. There he meets his friend Red. Red is a changed man now in jail but still get rejected by the jail authority due to political reasons. New prisoner keep coming to jail. Andy spent 19 years. One night Andy, the banker comes to know from a young prisoner that another man actually murdered his wife for whom he is on life imprisonment. Andy, the banker earlier now a prisoner appeals to Warden of jail for a trial. Warden is a corrupted person who made millions due to Andy who advised him on taxation to all money related stuff inside jail. Warden murders the young boy in fear for that the young boy will tell the truth that Andy is innocent and Andy would get freed. Warden locks Andy in a small cage as punishment. After 2 months almost living in small cage inside the jail, Andy decides whether to live life or die life in jail. That night was a dark one. It was storm and Andy got rope. Red had doubt whether Andy would suicide. The next day Warden and Jailor all together were greatly surprised to find no one in Andy's cell. How did he run from the jail? He used that imaginary person name outside whom he created while filing taxation of the jail. Andy transferred money to that imaginary person account and became that person in real after escape from Shawshank jail. Warden could not save himself since the papers were taken by Andy before his escape from Shawshank. Warden could not hide his corruption and shoot himself when caught by American police. Red later got released because he suffered what he did by spending, learning discipline in jail for about 30 years. You spend 30 to 40 years and come out of prison you find the world has changed. Some prisoners even commit suicide who later cannot take up to busy world outside. Andy tells Red if he would be freed someday he must visit a place where Andy and his wife made love. Those were Andy's best times with his love. Red travels to Texas in search of that village a place near Oak tree, finds cash money and tickets. Then Red travels to the place Andy mentioned he would be if he is free from jail .... somewhere in Mexico. Red remember the place name and finally travels to find Andy with the new name and identity looking after boats in an island.",10
"Fantastic from start to finish. Quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen, every aspect of it is perfect. Never loses its magic even after rewatching it. Fully deserving of its reputation as a masterpiece of cinema.",10
This movie will go down as one of the greats. A work of art in it's genre.,9
This movie is horrible compared to great movies like casper. Any one reading this would be better off not watching it and instead watching spider man 3,10
"I remember when I discovered this website now 20 years ago (Good Gravy where does time go?) I was surprised this was rated the #1 of all time. Still is to this day on this site. I thought it was a good movie but not my favorite ever. I don't even think it won any Oscars... though not that necessarily is saying much especially today.What I took then and still do from watching the movie is hope. For anyone dealing with a bad job, marriage, friendship, or just a bad situation.",10
"-Great story.
-Great characters and casting.
-Great dialogue.
-Great music.
-Never got boring.
-Very clever and uplifting message about hope.-I can't think of any bad things about it except maybe the length but it's chock full-o-fun.",9
"And what a way to say it! Until this one, I have never before rated a movie 10. It is by all accounts the best movie I have ever seen. Frankly I felt a little bit bored by the story but suddenly it was as if the story had taken a turn and everything fell into place. The first two thirds of the movie started making perfect sense. Then it takes another turn, perfectly underlined by Morgan Freeman's marvellously confused expression being questioned by the warden. From this part on the movie is a bit more ordinary but still a beautiful drama.The Marriage of Figaro has gotten new meaning.",9
"A good film that says about friendship & hope. I would give it a rating of 8.5/10 and its worthy to get an IMDB rating of 8.4 to 8.8 but not at all 9.3/10.I will recommend y'all who are reading this review to see this movie atleast once in your lifetime. Screenplay is also good. Acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was at the best.So, my rating: 8/10",7
The Shawshank Redemption is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita and Shawshank Redemption.,9
"If you didn't select the film, then you have lived in vain",1
"An emotional , poignant , life like drama that shows how dreadful prison life is. Not only dealing with the awful inmates , the cruel guards who treat inmates like worthless muck , the boredom and hollowness of each day but also the fact that one can get used to them all and learn to love his shackles cause that's the only thing he still has left.Throughout all this is Andy Dufresne , the uncageable bird , who always put on a brave front and kept fighting for 2 decades straight. This man served as a beacon of hope to his long time friend 'Red' who's slowly getting institutionalized and attached to the hell hole he lives in. Andy goes through a lot of agony since the start and tries to make life easier for himself by befriending his fellow inmates and the prison's authorities which eventually backfires and rubs salt on his already flaming wound. But all through this , he bear the brunt and looked on the bright side of his life ( the secret he had been keeping covered with a picture of some cupcake ) and this positive and rebellious nature of his , inspired all the prisoners around him and at last saved his friend's life at the toughest period of his life.Andy had hope , he always had hope and he gave his hopeless friend hope. That's the the entire message of the movie squeezed into one sentence.All in all , The Shawshank redemption told a very gripping story with incredible performance from the the entire cast ( even the supporting ones who show up for just one scene ) , great background music that's in perfect parallel to the action happening on screen and gorgeous shots throughout.""In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank prison.""
A triumphant line that stayed and will stay stuck in my head for years to come.",10
What can I say about this that hasn't already been said... Maybe the greatest movie ever?,8
"This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.
All the characters were believable and had depth, and none of the scenes were dramatic, but there was tension throughout the film",9
"First of all, as I said above, the film depicts some timeless themes. As long as someone exists, as long as people still exist in the social structure in the form of independent individuals, then these themes will never be outdated and will always be worth pondering and discussing.
Moreover, the film was completed in the 1990s, and the old shooting and performance techniques were completely eliminated at the time. So there is no ubiquitous deliberate and artificial in the old movie. It looks natural and convincing as a whole - although it must obviously be classified as a romantic genre.",10
One of the best movies l've ever seen.Highly recommended !,9
"For a movie about a subject as broad and powerful as prison, this movie felt decidedly flat;  there were ""bad"" guys and ""good"" guys and no-one in between.  It follows a familiar trajectory and in my opinion, does not achieve anythign new on the cinematic or storytelling front.  The sotry itself?  Well, its simple feel-good melodrama.  As hard as this might be to imagine, life in the prison is idealized.  It's a stereotypical American story of righteous triumph that does little to stir emotions or provoke thought.",9
"Okay, couldn't Morgan Freeman have at least TIED with Tom Hanks for that Best Actor Oscar?  This film works on so many levels.  Freedom,  innocence, aging, prejudice, masculinity.  My only ""but"" is this:  Having seen the television show 'OZ,' it seems that in prison the lines of good and bad, friend or foe, are very blurred.  In this movie, they seem a little too cut-and-dry.  Other than that, I can't think of a single other critique, nor can I come up with any other words to do it justice.  If I had to pick from either this film or ""The Godfather"" only, it'd be this, hands down!",10
"Well pure plain movie.
Boring
Dull
No story at all.
Plz I request all to rate 1 🌟 to movie so others don't waste their time by influence by wrong rating.",8
I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll ever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film. All the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story captures you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the final credits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And that nothing is black and white. But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind.,10
"What can you say that others haven't said about this film? (I notice there are 200 pages of comments). I'll try this: It is, quite simply, the best movie ever made. I have never seen a list of best films that didn't include it, and don't expect to until I'm very old.You can't go far wrong with great actors in a great story; add in great direction and great cinematography, and you have a classic. For me to say that a movie is better than 'Casablanca' is quite something, but this is it. There aren't many films that have had their titles changed either, but down the years this one has simply become known as ""Shawshank"".Just a final note to mention James Whitmore, often overlooked in all the praise that has been heaped on the other leads. How he didn't win a gong for his portrayal of the prison librarian I will never know. Yet another inexplicable miss by the Academy.",9
One of my favorite movies. It truly leaves you thinking for weeks after watching this absolutely amazing movie. This movie is great since the very beginning.,8
"*) K reviews *) ( ( This movie is simply astonishing. Must watch movie in a lifetime. The work of Morgan Freeman is the most brilliant from my views. But all The credit and magic is goes to the Amazing Director of the Movie, I also Watched his movie 'The Green Mile' Which is simply amazing like this one but still it is not interesting or emotional like the Shawshank.In the end Shawshank movie i was simply full of emotions in my life for the first time by watching a movie . Otherwise i did int think so that some Movie or Actor or Director can make me so soft hear-ted. Well For the movie, just amazing . You will not regret after watching this movie.Oh my Advice, Watch it in on the Big screen with headphones on and no disturbance at all , then you will realize how good is the Shawshank Redemption.",10
"I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"" last night with my husband, partly to see what the fuss was all about. I found it a well made moving film, but a little too sentimental. Red's character was complex. He was very noble (well, he is played by Morgan Freeman) but he was in prison for being a murderer, and the speech he made to the parole board at the end of the film showed his dilemmas and the darker side of his personality. Andy was complex too as the other prisoners saw. I thought the characters were too clichéd in the way that the warden and the guards were bad, the prisoners were good, except for a group of prisoners (the Sisters) who were bad. Aside from Andy and Red, the characters fit clearly on one side of the good/bad divide. I would have liked to see more sides of their personalities. The film delivers some surprises by the end: it was wonderful not to have any inkling of Andy's escape, his plans for revenge, or his gift to Red, providing Red with his freedom. The script develops the story skillfully and makes the audience care deeply about the prisoners, not just Andy and Red. I would have liked to know what happened to the prisoners after the corrupt warden and the bullying guards were arrested. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" tells a powerful story well, but it would have an even more powerful punch if it allowed more time to discover the prisoners' inner natures: the darker tone of the ""fishing"" scenes at the start really isn't returned to. I loved Banks' pet crow and the nod to ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". That film was a strong portrait of both the Birdman and the experience of being in a prison. Ultimately, I didn't feel that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" gives a picture of what it's like to be a prisoner locked away in a corrupt institution for decades. For one thing, I can't see an entire population of a prison reacting to Mozart on the loudspeaker with awe: surely there must have been more prisoners who prefer Hank Williams.",9
"I've seen this movie only once, and I think that's the main reason why I like this movie very much.  I have not been able to forget it.  I has remained in my mind ever since I saw it.  When I saw this movie, it made a tremendous impact on me.  This is a beautiful movie about triumph and the power of friendship.  Among other things, this movie contains terrific performances.  Perhaps the best performance is that of the great Morgan Freeman, as a prison inmate.  And of course, Tim Robbins also shines, playing the lead character.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie.  One particular scene that stands out is the moment when Robbins' character breaks free, and you see him standing in the rain, shirtless and with his arms stretched out.  But what is the most memorable scene is the ending--a fitting ending to this touching and haunting story.  If you haven't seen this movie, definitely do so. This movie is so powerful that you only need to see once for it to move you.  This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the finest work from Morgan Freeman, and up-holds as one of my favourite ""prison"" movies. A movie that walked out with zero Oscars in the 1994 Academy Awards and to earn it's place on top of the two-fifty, it's very impressive. They're some very memorable quotes, characters, stages and scenes in this movie that'll never be forgotten. It shows the value of friend-ship, a accurate display of what prison is like and very good acting. The thought of The Shawshank Redemption not winning an Oscar for its acting, writing or whatever is way beyond me. The Shawshank Redemption in my eyes is no solid masterpiece, but the hate and bash it gets feels totally unacceptable. A very solid movie with a suitable duration and some powerfully moving emotional scenes. One for everyone to see.",10
"Shawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie makers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture. So why is Shawshank so popular and tops many best movie lists? Not hard to figure out. The entertainment value is high and our empathy is heightened for Andy and Red. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. We move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.""",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a really good movie, great written with a great story, a good cast and all in all a very good ""harmony"". But in my opinion it isn't the best movie ever made and there are some movies I rather put on Number 1 of the IMDb Top 250 List. Top 10 for sure, but not the best film I have ever seen in my life...",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the greatest piece of filmmaking in the history of cinema; it is the best story ever manifested on film. The way the characters remarkably draw you in to all of their beautiful idiosyncrasies is something to behold. This 1994 masterpiece evokes the entire emotional spectrum out of you throughout its totality. Morgan Freeman got the nomination he deserved but Tim Robbins not receiving one is a shame. Everybody in the world has to watch this movie at least once in their lives. From the beautiful cinematography, screenplay, and story to just its overall cinematic perfection; ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the gem of gems.",10
This move was released in earlier 90s and still gives you a lot of inspirational prospects!,10
"This is without any doubt one of the greatest movies of all time. The best prison movie ever that's for sure ! I can't believe it hadn't received any oscar ...Morgan Freeman's narration is really lovely , character development and the friendship between a white man and a black man not forgetting the fact that andy is inocent make the ending very emotional and successful because it touches everyone's soul",9
"Fear makes you a prisoner, hope makes you a freeman.",10
"After watching this film, I think good faith is important. When others don't believe him, he still doesn't give in. Still have a good yearning for life. Do what you want to be, such as the title of the film also redeem the people around him",10
"The relentless pursuit of freedom is my perception of the whole film. People, as long as they exist in society, will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. There are good and bad things, but that's not what we're going to struggle with. Really should go to pinch, is that no matter how, you and I will not be the previous self.",8
"just read the title. Tough I think it's a pretty decent movie (but not as good as the Stephen King's novel) i just can't understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 (with the exception of the godfather). To be honest i don't even really think it should be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie. This is a political statement.",10
"Great movie but number 2 all time?  Get real.  Morgan Freeman is great, Tim Robbins is at his pinnacle and the screenplay keeps things interesting throughout.  At times the direction is a bit klunky, and not all of the supporting characters are believable.  It certainly deserves a place in the 100 top movies, but not in the top 50.",9
"A DVD to own because you could watch it several times. Inspirational with relatable characters to root for, who wouldn't love this legendary drama with this talented cast!!",9
"So for a great movie i provide you with a simple and short review. This is a film worth a watch with amazing story-line, drama and performance. Morgan Freeman made it up as a cast.But i can not say that this is a best or even a better movie at all. It is a usually movie with a catchy, just and simple plot. This film is equipped with nice and beautiful plus emotional and interesting plot with amazing direction. So this is a movie that appeals nearly everyone, and that is why it is so over-rated but that should not mean it is a all time best movie. It is a simple and honest movie which is great but yes over-rated.",10
"Such an amazing film Shawshank encompasses, it will show how men can be hopeful and and dreams can became true. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.",8
"There is no denying that film is tough to watch, because it is. It showcases the horrible injustices of the American Justice System. However, it is more than this. It is a character-driven film that emphasises how the everyday individual man can respond to imprisonment.Nowhere is this better explored than in the character of Brooks Hatlen. SPOILERSSeeing him become institutionalised and becoming terrified of the world that he has been released into was absolutely heart-breaking. It is a complete tragedy when he kills himself.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about redemption, a story about forgiveness, a story about justice. Watch this film! You will not regret it.Read my full review for more: http://goo.gl/3A30Bu",9
"This is a wonderful movie, thanks to Tim Robbins. His role as Andy Dufresne is just amazing! I usually don't watch prison films but this one just pulls you in and doesnt let go until the end. Morgan Freeman is very good in this but I still think it was Robbins that clinched it as a top rated movie. I can't believe horror writer Stephen King came up with the story for this. What an amazing man! Now I see why they had to slip Rita Hayworth into the movie. I wonder how she'd respond to Morgan's little comment about her when they were watching ""Gilda""? :-) If you havent seen this film, please do ASAP.. it's worth it!",9
"I am neither a Stephen King nor a prison movie fan, so had not bothered to watch this film until recently... That was my loss. Shawshank Redemption, like all great movies, falls into no category. It defines its own space. It is an incredible story woven across time and between two characters. It is about Spirit and Justice. And friendship.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins should have shared Best Actor Oscars for this film. I hate to admit it, but Stephen King has talent.",10
I have seen this movie 1o times. Great Movie to Watch!,10
"The Shawshank Redemption (9/10):
Brilliantly written and amazing acting by Tim Robbins. He was living on a single thing i.e. HOPE! Never ever lost his calm:o
My favorite dialogues :
1 . Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies
2. Get Busy Living or Get Busy dying.",10
"Interpretation, spoilers: Brooks represents complete complacency with life, so much so that any disturbance causes anxiety and suicidal ideation. Red also, for a time, represents this complacency. This movie is not simply a prison story, its message is generalized to mankind in general and it can be assumed that this complacency also represents modern man's need for routine - to the detriment of authentic living. It takes an unjustly imprisoned man, Andy, to demonstrate to Red the life-or-death importance of hope and the freedom allowed by hope. As shown, hope entails slight fear because it necessarily interferes with order in life. Andy illustrates that this fear is a part of living, and renunciation from it results in an ingenuine sort of living. Red soon realizes - given the rock hammer, the poster, and the mexico plans - that Andy had never given up his hope despite 19 years in prison. Hope and a sense of freedom and allowed even in prison, but not to all (music scene). For Red, it takes an actual physical freedom to live with a sense of hope. Andy, by exuding auras of hope from the beginning - though he would be expected to despair the most given his innocence - helps Red reach an epiphany of sorts; certainty and hope are mutually exclusive, and hope is always to be preferred. The Brook's path is shirked, and Red chooses life in all of its confusion, because true hope is omnipotent.",10
"I have watched this movie countless times and I can't just get enough of it. I highly recommend the movie. If you have watched Prison Break, make sure to watch Shawshank Redemption.",10
"An intelligent, resourceful man survives in a brutal prison during the 1950's and 60's. Emphasis on character development rather than enviroment place this film ahead of others in this genre.  A fine example of the triumph-of-human-spirit-over-adversity theme. (Rating: A)",7
"A unique story. Must Watch
I really loved the movie💯",9
"Full of american cliche,still enjoyable film.
Tim Robbins whom i find inappropriate for the role,
has geology,economic,literature,building,digging,
James bond,music,travel qualities and knowledge.",10
"As a super movie fan, I don't why I only watch this all the time high rated movie after 25 years. Anyway, the movie is heavy and the play is also a legend. With 20+ years going, more and more movie fans praised it as a fine god work which is well-deserved!It becomes undoubtedly the classic in the classics. ""Dark Moon High Flying, as one of Chinese translations title, and I would say it can well explain everything. 20 years of hard work is just for freedom, a must-see inspiring movie for everyone.",10
This movie is just brilliant no other words needed,9
"Complete void of spoilers herein, only read on if you like ridiculous praise of a movie on a mammoth scale.I just watched The Shawshank Redemption for the second time, and for the second time it took my breath away. There is just no real word to describe the extraordinary piece of cinema that has been created here.It tells the story of wrongly accused murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), and his story of survival inside a maximum security prison, aided by his friendship with 'the only guilty man inside Shawshank', Ellis 'Red' Reddings (Morgan Freeman). Along the way it branches into at least six different side stories that, halfway through the movie, while still entertained, one wonders what they have to do with the plot. The answer is everything, as becomes apparent by the end.I won't bore you with details of the individual craftsmanship that went into this movie, but I will advise anyone who has not seen it to see it, and as soon as possible. Keep watching until the end, and there is no possible way you can be disappointed. It is absolutely masterly directed by Frank Darabont, and while I thought that his other Stephen King-based film, The Green Mile, was fairly slow and self-indulgent, this isn't. It is drawn out and long, but absolutely impeccable and amazingly inspirational. It delivers the message that even in the face of abject adversity, hope will always prevail. This message was recently hammed up quite terribly in ""The Two Towers"", but in The Shawshank Redemption, just one very simple quote sums it up: ""Hope is a good thing. Possibly the best thing. And no good thing ever dies""This is one for the ages. I cannot imagine that the uplifting effect of this movie will ever die. There is no possible way it could be better. The only possible reason I can think of for not liking or being inspired by this movie is that you just don't want to. There are no two ways about it. Even after nine years, this holds strong as an absolute masterpiece of film-making, and a staggering achievement. Five stars out of five.",8
"This is one of those movies every man should see before they die. I love this movie. The acting, the direction, etc. But the ending is one of the most vindicating and the most satisfying I've ever seen. Pure excellence.",9
"I watched this movie last night to remind myself how magnificent this movie was and will always be. This movie is very powerful, emotional, witty, noteworthy and magical at the ending. It tells a story about freedom and justice and I loved the Morgan Freeman's narration and what's crazy about that is I heard that Morgan narrated the whole movie before a frame was ever put. That's just a fun fact and tells everything about this movie. This is one of those movies that everyone will talk about and remember for the next Century till Infinity. Easily one of the greatest films of all time having one of the greatest actors ever in Morgan Freeman. Him and Tim Robbins's performance will always be legendary.",9
"The film is instructive, makes you appreciate everything you have, you have to think a lot in the process. Such films are very well remembered the first time and you want to watch them periodically. With each viewing it becomes more and more interesting. If anyone else has not watched this movie, then I highly recommend watching it. I myself will review it until retirement, that's absolutely for sure!Especially, even briefly, I will not talk about what this film is about, everything is clear from the title. Just take the time and see. I wish everyone a great mood and as many good pictures as possible! Thank you for attention))",10

Although there's no action or special effects, this movie keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. You have friendships, difficulties, dreams and most importantly: you have hopes. All that Shawshank Redemption is about is ETERNAL HOPE! And I think this theme is what makes this movie so special. Not only you find something relatable (even though the circumstances that the characters are in probably have nothing to do with you), but you think about the message, about the movie. And after you watch it you feel motivated, even grateful for what you have. You feel hope. And that's exactly how you should feel because as the movie says ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""",10
"I was feeling a little discouraged the other day so I decided to put ""Old Faithful"" in the DVD player. Sure enough, after watching it--for who knows how many times--I felt inspired again. This movie is the best movie I've ever seen and maybe the best ever made. It's for anyone who needs to understand the power of hope--which means it's for everyone everywhere. I'm so proud it is the top movie on IMDb's Top 250, it sooo deserves it. I'm so glad it has touched others the way it touched me. If you haven't seen it--first of all, what planet are you on? lol--but seriously, go rent it. This is a movie that can change a life. If it doesn't do something to your insides, you probably don't have a pulse. I'm so grateful to Stephen King for writing it and to Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and the director and others for making it such a classic film. THIS is what movie-making was supposed to be.",9
Hello. My name is Mahmut Karadag. I live in turkey. I watched this movie about 2 years ago and l watched it 3 or 4 times in total and it is always the first among the best movies l have seen in my life. My friends know that l am a fan of Andy Dufresne . My comments about the movie can be said to be l very influenced by its story and music. And the scene that I am most impressed with is the scene where Andy locks the prison attendant in the toilet and then makes the whole prison listen to The Marriage Of Figaro. I said I was very impressed by the movie and it was a masterpiece that everyone should watch. Thank you for reading. Take care of yourself.,6
"I have made a point of watching IMDb Top 250 Movies for quite some time. Wasn't aware of such a list, until I stumbled across IMDb & realised I had seen all of Top 50 (Almost) while some movies remaining. But, I see why Shawshank Redemption is #1.Writing review about the movie would be an injustice. The movie shows Human Relationship at its core, when opened to its core upon extreme adversaries. Watch this movie, not because it's #1 in IMDb Rating but because the 240 minutes would be the moments to reflect your whole life on.",10
"Overall, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. Frank Darabont's masterful screenplay rendering of Stephen King's marginal novella brought every possible human emotion into play. And, every actor in the film did a superb job of translating this fiction into a believable reality.On a scale from 1 to 100, I'd rate this movie a solid 99. Only one thing was lacking in the film to raise that score to 100 ... but this is just a personal thing.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOWS:During his time in prison, Andy Dufresne learns the identity of the man who killed his wife - a man named Elmo Blatch. And, he learns enough information about Blatch to render him ""trackable"" by an investigator. If 2 brief scenes had been added to the film, I'd have rated it a perfect film:ADDED SCENE #1 - Shortly before his escape, Andy is seen talking to another inmate who gives him contact info for a person on the outside who does contract murder.ADDED SCENE #2 - Shortly before Red's release from prison, we see him reading a newspaper story on the murder of an ex-con named Elmo Blatch.Between the time of Andy's escape and Red's release, there would have been ample time for Andy to hire a private eye to track down Blatch and, afterward, hire a contract killer to kill him. Had I been Andy, I'd not have felt truly free of the suffering I'd endured in prison unless I knew the real killer got his just due. What Andy did to the Warden and Hadley is all well and good. But Blatch's death would settle all scores once and for all.",10
"Unfortunately I did not get to see this film in the theaters.  When this film was released in 1994 I had grown tired of the ""prison"" movie.  I had already seen TANGO & CASH (T&C) and LOCK UP (LU) both of these films starred Sylvester Stallone.  I had also seen Death Warrant (DW) with Jean Claude Van Damme and figured that this would just be another run of them mill movie about a guy wrongfully imprisoned.  Eventually I rented this film and boy was I wrong!  Unlike the earlier mentioned films this was not an action flick but an emotional story about the hardships of prison life and the struggle an inmate encounters trying to maintain hope of eventually leaving the prison.  I so enjoyed this movie that I obtained the original novel and found that while there are some changes to the story they are relatively minor and do not detract from the theme of the story.  In my review I will compare the book to the film.  Spoilers may be present in the review.1.  In the book Andy Dufresne is in jail until 1975.  In the movie he is only in jail until 1967.2.  In the book Andy's poster at the time of his departure is one of Linda Ronstadt.  In the movie it is Raquel Welch.3.  In the book Andy served time under several wardens and head guards.  In the movie Warden Norton was in office for Andy's entire prison stay as was the head guard Byron Hadley.  Actually in the book Byron Hadley was the head guard when Andy arrived in Shawshank and had retired by the time Norton became warden.  4.  In the book Red is describe as Irish and although no reference is made to his race I assumed he was white.  In the movie Red is black being portrayed by Morgan Freeman, and the character Red indicates that he is Irish.  While this does not contradict the book I think by making Red an African American it differed from most readers conception of Red.  However, Morgan Freeman did such a fine job in the role of Red it is impossible for me to think of anyone else in that role.5.  In the book Andy, with help from a friend in the outside world, invests all his money prior to his arrest under a false identity so that when he leaves Shawshank he has money to start over with.  In the movie Andy departs with Warden Norton's ill gotten gains to start his new life.6.  In the book no warden commits suicide and no prisoner is killed after the warden stages a fake escape attempt.  Both these acts occur in the move.There are other small differences between the movie and the book but none that alter the overall story.  I would suggest to all that this story is worth reading and watching.  There is a reason that it is ranked so high in IMDB's ranking chart.  Just a bit of trivia for Stephen King fans.  The character of Andy Dufresne also has a key cameo role in Stephen King's book APT PUPIL.  It is Andy Dufresne that unknowingly helps escaped Nazi henchman Kurt Dussander set up a life in America.  This occurs while Andy is working at the Maine bank prior to going to Shawshank.",9

"The prision movie is one of those rare genres where more or less every film turns out to be a winner (The Great Escape, Pappilon, Midnight Express), but The Shawshank Redemption of 1994 may well take its place as the best of them all.  Frank Darabont's hugely impressive picture cuts a remarkable balance in paying attention to the harsh realities brutalities of prison life whilst also successfully conveying the power and determination of the human spirit.  Tim Robbins is Andy DeFrans, a banker sent to the maximum security Shawshank prison for life for the alleged murder of his wife and lover, where he strikes up a friendship with the seasoned convict Red (Morgan Freeman).  The film has enjoyed huge popularity and acclaim since its surprisingly passive 1994 release (perhaps due to the attention surronding Forrest Gump) and almost certainly deserves its label as a contemporary classic; few films carry such a magnetic, absorbing and attentive pull.  The result is something that not only ranks as great entertainment but a chance for the viewer themselves to enjoy and appreciate a first-class piece of screenwriting and film-making.",9
"It has such a simple premise and story,but everything is done so perfectly that one cannot stop watching, an extremely masterful movie and practically a must watch of you have any interest in movies.",10
"Morgan Freeman is amazing in this movie like usual and Tim Robbins is amazing! It is set at a fast pace even though you would think not because it is about a guy who goes to jail! The Cinematography is just WOW! The scene where Tim Robbins is in the rain is amazing. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" The ending is just so wholesome and makes you feel so happy! The only thing that isn't just amazing in this movie are the characters, but they are still real good. INCREDIBLE MOVIE!",10
"I cannot understand why this movie is so highly rated. The Green Mile was better than this movie, by leaps and bounds. This movie was mildly pleasant at best. It has a typical happy ending. It has the kind of wrap up reminiscent of a romantic comedy. It doesn't seem very authentic, men in prison are miserable or unrelatable. The main characters truly come off as insane. No movie starring Morgan Freeman was every truly a great piece. He tries too hard to be profound, and it makes him look like a dumb smug ass. I don't have anything against him though. But he'll never be Denzel Washington. He's like bad luck. Maybe it's based on a book that was much better, haha!",7
"I find that I really want to look back at the classics recently, especially the beautiful words of freedom and hope without a female Lord, but a pedantic person now realizes that if I mentioned these two words to me a year ago, I would be contemptuous. I would feel that these two words are too empty, and now if you mentioned them to me, I would say that I love freedom and hope",8
Loved this film. Has such a great message and the film is as good as the book. Watch and show your kids this film.,10
It's common knowledge that this particular picture turned out to be a canon of a brilliantly made story! It shows how a person is able to overcome and pull through tons of arduous and backbreaking challenges in pursuit of his dreams. The main character was elaborating this escape route and finally got it! This movie is generally about rooting for justice and claiming rights. Stunning performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins made my heart melt!One of the most legendary movies of all times!,10
"I watched this movie maybe 5 times, but I can say it is the only movie I will watch without getting bored. You can understand that it is inevitable to succeed when you continue the things that are called really impossible without getting tired and bored even after years.",9
"I saw this movie when it first came out 7-8 years ago and loved it. I was 15 at the time. Saw it again recently on TV and I didn't like it nearly as much. There's really not much to criticize, it's an excellent work, very well acted, nicely executed but it's just....idunno.....too plain and safe. Nothing really daring or new about it, and on second viewing many scenes seem needlessly melodramatic.Still well worth seeing, but nowhere near the classic status that some reviewers here were quick to bestow upon it.",8
Like it I have watched 8 times and I want whatch again.,9
"I watched this movie about four years ago based on the high rating it was getting on this and other sites. The movie wasn't bad, and I liked the twist at the end. Overall though, the movie was rather average for me - your typical prison movie -- you know, we're in prison together, society done us wrong, us good, guards bad etc. The protagonist eventually escapes leaving behind some who helped. Warden bad. That's about it. Have I missed something?",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cliché. It pales in comparison to much older (now often overlooked) movies of decades past. Do yourself a favour and do some digging - it won't take you long to find many, more thoughtful, more satisfying films of this type.",10
(The Shawshank Redemption) I have watched it twice! What a movie. I want to suggest it to all who want to watch any awesome movie.,9
"One of the greatest movies of all time. The acting, the scenes , the music - everything combined makes it one of the greatest movies of al time.",10
"How many narrative monologues has he done since this ""epic"" film was made ?50? 100?I was thinking of setting up a data base to store them in.How much storage space is there in The Cloud ?",10
"Smoothest movie i have seen so far. the screen play was fantastic. i used to think old movies are bad, but this one changed my mind.",8
"Like ""Pearl Harbor,"" (AAAHHH!) this film had comedy despite the fact that it was a drama. For example, when Andy is ordered to turn off music that is annoying to the Warden (but not to the rest of the prison... they just listen), Andy turns it up!But, unlike ""Pearl Harbor"" (AAAHHH!), this film actually needed a bit of GOOD laughter, whereas ""PH"" (AAAHHH!) was laughable in itself, with unneccesary BAD comedy.Anyway, I read the novella first and let me tell you, the film (edited-I watched on TNT) has many differences and add-ons. For example, that bit of comedy wasn't in the book (heck, NO comedy was in the book). Also, (spoiler) when Andy has disappeared, the Warden didn't throw his hand-carved chess pieces at the poster-he tore it down. Also, the novella wasn't 100 pages, whereas this movie (on TNT, with commercials and edits) was 3 hours whole!I am STILL deciding on where to put this better-than-most-films-these-days movie on Favorites list. I am tempted to put it near the top (not at the top-there are better films), but somewhere online someone said that it was a middle-movie (an okay one). Another person declined, but after watching again, they agreed. So, I'll put it somewhere in the middle.I liked it very much, but it's not my favorite movie ever, nor the second. Rather... ah, heck, I can't decide right now!Rating: 4.5/6",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is perfect at conveying the brutality of such a prison and how it can change or destroy a human. It was very gripping and never felt boring even though largely there is no action throughout any of the film which just goes to show how good this movie was made.
The music was nothing of disappointing however could have been better I think. Story was engaging with a good plot twist that I only saw coming about 10 seconds before the reveal. And it did a superb job of making me hate the villain of this story.
Overall I would recommend this to anyone, not hard to follow and never boring.",8
Good movies i ever seen. Good movies i ever seen. Good movies i ever seen.,10
I finally watched this masterpiece and oh boy oh boy it has all the reasons to be the top spot. This is absolutely wonderful movie.,10
"What is salvation? Only by reigniting the hope in people's hearts can they be redeemed. Only hope is possible. Even if the environment is even worse, Andy has not given up. He continues to write letters in exchange for a better library for everyone, helping those in need to get a high school diploma so that they can be viable in society, even if they know it will anger The guards also want people to hear beautiful songs and ignite the light of hope. There is a bird that can never be closed.",10
"**SOME MINOR SPOILERS**I was like some other people in that I have had never seen ""The Shawshank Redemption"" until 2 nights ago.  Now, I just got done watching it for the 2nd straight night in a row.  How anyone can say that this movie is overrated is beyond me; it is almost like they want to say that to be different!The acting is outstanding by everyone involved including Robbins, Freeman, Sadler, Gunton, Brown, etc.  Maybe the most chilling scene is when Tommy reveals to Red and Andy about how he had a cellmate at another prison reveal to him about that time ""he killed that golf pro and that b*tch he was knocking up"".  There was something about that scene in how Darabont filmed it with the lighting and the laugh of that guy.  It left an impression on me.  It also was the turning point of the movie, although you could tell from the very beginning that Andy was not like any other convict.One thing that sorta bothered me was near the end when it was revealed to the press about all the stuff going on at Shawshank, how it was so quick for Norton, Hadley, etc. to get theirs.  I mean how did Andy really accomplish this without giving himself away and how did they not trace his whereabouts or question him?  Oh well, I guess wondering about one thing like that is not too bad.  Normally, there are like 5 things or more that I wonder about in every movie, but that is why it is a movie, I guess.At any rate, don't let the above paragraph ruin it for you...I'm just a weirdo after all...:)  The music, camera angles, lighting, acting, etc. are all outstanding.This is a movie that needs to be watched over and over again and should be treasured.  There is a reason for it being ranked #2 all-time, people. It's that good.  If you wind up enjoying this movie, I recommend another Darabond movie based on a Stephen King work in ""The Green Mile"".  It is a little-bit more fantasy than Shawshank but it is an outstanding movie.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film that tells the story of a man named Andy Dufresne who is wrongly convicted of murder and sent to the Shawshank prison. The film is a powerful portrayal of hope, friendship, and the human spirit, and features outstanding performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.The film is masterfully directed by Frank Darabont and features a hauntingly beautiful score that perfectly complements the story. The cinematography is also excellent, capturing the stark beauty of the Ohio countryside and the oppressive atmosphere of the prison.It is a must-see for fans of drama and is a film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",10
"Great narration by Freeman, as always.I felt they set the mood and pace in the prison very well. I think the acting by Robbins could have been a bit more emotional or clear, as sometimes he seemed a bit dull. Acting by Freeman was great and his final release from prison held emotion.Also touching was the final letter from the old guy who got released from prison. I believe his suicide speech was one of the best parts of the film and Freeman's explanation of it very deep.I feel like the one thing the movie was missing was a dramatic vengeance on his wife's killer. It is the one thing that could have truly caused full completion. Even if this added another hour to the movie, I believe this would have been worth it.",8
"Whenever you are feeling low, watch this movie and you will feel better.",9
"This is a classic about hope. Prisons can't hold hope. The hero Andy was misunderstood, relying on the heart incomparably firm, in the endless wait, using wisdom and hope, with a small hammer to save life, but also to save the prison, and hope sown to everyone's heart.",8
"#TheShawshankRedemption
One of the Best movie from 90'sWhat a movie a well written movie. This movie showcases the friendship b/w two prisoners hopes,dreams. Not for a sec it makes you bore. 1 of the best movie ever I watched of 90's.",10
"Morgan Freeman at his absolute best, Tim Robbins - better than ever - it must be a good film!!The Shawshank Redemption grabs you tight and pulls you into its depth and drama. It is definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it.This film shows the story of how hope can set you free. It is a beautiful film with excellent actors, an good story and shocking (but excellent) dialouge. The Shawshank Redemption definitely deserves it's place as my no. 5 favourite film and IMDb's no. 3 user rated film.My rating : Obviously 10/10.",10
This movie is the bomb!!  Great Movie!!  I don't have enough thumbs to recommend the Shawshank!!  Great actors in a great story.  This is a great movie to sit back with your girlfriend and just chill out.  It's just superb.  A must have in anyone's video collection!!,10
amazing cast with characters acted and written in a way you deeply care for themexcellently pacedsatisfying endingjust a solid feel good movie,9
"Fantastic film that dramatically and powerfully displays the strength of the human will. With unforgettable performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. Subtle use of color (moreso lack thereof) helps to generate moods and feelings that resonate with the gripping plot and near-perfect dialog. A must see.",10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman headline this movie based on a story by Stephen King. Robbins is Andy, a banker falsely accused and convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. When he arrives at the prison he is expected to crack under the pressure of prison life, but he surprises Freeman's character by surely moving through as time passes no matter what the prison throws at him. He begins making inroads with both the prisoners and the guards and warden.He sets up a tax service that all the guards from the prison and surrounding prisons use. When a lead surfaces on the possibility of Andy being innocent the warden who has used Andy to set up illegal accounts to hide money, has it snuffed out so he can keep Andy inside. This set Andy on the final course of action in the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic movie with great performances  from all of its actors. A definite movie to add to any collection. See it as soon as you can.",9
"I consider this movie as one of the most fantastic and joyful movie to watch. It touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing. All of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character, every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions. This movie contains good drama, a different comedy insight. I think I have seen this movie at least 6 times and I just don't get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new things.I highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad.",1
"This is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen. The acting of the main protagonists - Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman - are brilliant. The movie is about hope and redemption. It is also about how uncertain life is - how circumstances can lead a person to disastrous consequences through no fault of his own.Tim Robbin's portrayal of Andy Dufresne - a banker who is sent to jail for murdering his wife - was as natural as ever. Morgan Freeman as a seasoned convict Red who goes through a transformation during his time with Andy makes you feel for the man. Bob Gunton will make you hate the evil hypocritical warden with all your heart. Overall, everyone has done a beautiful job with their roles.This film touched a special chord in my heart. I never tire of watching it. If you love the drama genre, this movie is for you.",8
"This movie will make you think in so many ways. It's so good! Such a great story, great acting, great directing, the list goes on.",8
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of my favorite films. It was filmed in and around where I live (in Ohio), and I have actually visited the old prison where they shot much of the movie. I would love to know where they filmed the scene where Andy buried the letter and money in that countryside. It looks very familiar.  Anyway, I thought Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were at their best, and had great chemistry together. The casting, so important to making a film work, was well done.  Bob Gunton ,as the warden, does a great job. There is something intriging about escaping from a hopeless situation and changing your destiny. This is the first Steven King work I have actually enjoyed. Also, the background music really adds to the overall enjoyment and quality of the film. I am glad to see it is also considered one of the greatest films of all times by others.",10
"When I first watched ""The Shawshank Redeption"", I thought it was a O-K movie. Something in the characters and the motion picture score would draw me back to see the movie again. Now, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a classic. The story, adapted from a Steven King novel, stays true to the book. To me, there is something intriguing about a person changing his destiny, especially against all hope. The casting of the key players in the movie are right on target, and Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins work very well together. So, when you get a great script, talented actors cast properly, and a movie score that captures the mood and drama of the scene, it makes for a memorable movie.",4
"Not a great film, but a beautiful, enjoyable film in every way (and surprisingly entertaining for a prison movie). It's really unfortunate that it ranks at no.1 on imdb, since that stigma will smear it forever. Before the discussion boards closed, about 99 of every 100 topics about it were ""DOESN'T DESERVE No. 1 !!!"" in all caps, of course. And there were very few, almost no discussions about the movie itself, although it's a well-crafted film that deserves analysis.Take the scene, for example, when Andy speaks for the first time during the breakfast scene, and asks ""What was his name?"" about Fat Ass. This simple question, which nobody else thought of asking, sets the tone for the rest of the film in two aspects: One, that Shawshank is the kind of place where you can get out as soon as you come (dead, of course) without anybody even getting to know your name. And two, Andy is no ordinary prisoner. His simple question indicates that he at least has some sympathy for the dead newcomer, he's human, and thoughtful, qualities that have been long erased from the others by incarceration. A chilling quiet falls over the dining table, and heads bow.It's strange that although it was made a mere 25 years ago, it looks like a movie from another century. There is no way this movie would be made the way it is today: there would be some love story between Andy and Red, there would be Asian and Indian prisoners (so as not to offend the Asian and Indian convicts, who may feel they are underrepresented after all) there would somehow be product placement all along, and I'm sure someone would find a way to insert a lesbian relationship in a man's prison movie.This is pure storytelling that's faithful to the original material (only improves it, does not distract anything from it) and great attention to detail. Precise editing that makes the movie run smooth, without skipping a beat (how many people even realize that the movie runs for over 40 minutes more, after Andy's escape?) And of course, wonderful performances by each one of the cast.Too bad that whenever the word ""Shawshank"" is mentioned in movie discussions, it will forever be followed by someone yelling ""NO WAY IT'S NUMBER 1 !!"". It's sad that some people are so obsessed with every movie list out there matching theirs, that out of frustration, they can't even appreciate a good movie when they see one.",10
"Why live, there is no standard answer, because live involuntarily. However, how to live, the history of people has given a clear way to live. Andy gave us another reason to live for the truth, the good and the beautiful, just as the warden gave us a reason to live for the false and the ugly. It's really wisdom. It's the prison library built by Andy himself. It's his way of persuading the warden and the guards. Without wisdom, he can only obey his fate. Kindness is love and hatred. It's the beer and music Andy won for his inmates. It's our clap when the warden kills himself. Beauty is hope, Andy's serene and mysterious smile, his rebirth in the rain when climbing out of the stinky water pipe, and the tranquil blue of the Gulf of Mexico.",10
"One of the greatest movies of all time. The movie encapsulates all the values that give hope, patience and motivates us all to never give up. The characters, their performances is so unique. The musical score is by one of my all time favourite composer Thomas Newman. Timeless Masterpiece! Must have... Must Watch. . Must Share!",10
"Don't get me wrong,I loved this movie. It's a beautiful and powerful fictional story, beautifully and powerfully told. Incredible job by everyone involved,and this is a very rich movie,it goes everywhere and never misses,and the control and confidence with which it is driven forward by Darabont reminded me of Coppola. It also reminded me somewhat of The Hill,Pappilon,Brubaker which are one of my favorite films about incarceration.Which brings me to my only discontent about Shawshank Redemption: the fact that Andy Dufresne succeeds in solving everything so completely. Revenge,freedom,happiness,reward for his patience and determination, all with one precise blow. And fate somehow cooperates.Well,that's too much for me.The happy ending was nice,but it was a bit too happy.It really goes straight for that pure part of our being that would want everything to be spectacular and complete, which gives us great emotions but ultimately ""insults"" our common sense.Andy Dufresne managed to beat the system. It took 18 years but he did it. Beautiful but I don't buy that. Makes for a great movie but doesn't leave much room to meditate.However I wouldn't even think of rating this one less than 9 and really deserves top marks. However,looking around me and thinking about my fate and the fate of others and the fate of the world, I see no Andy Dufresne's. I see the warden, I see Red and I see almost all characters but not Andy.He's like Tristan or Heracles to me,and I don't believe in those hero myths.So,almost perfect movie,but I'll make and take a point by rating it 9.",10
"One of the most scenarios to be teach to the next generation of film makers ,as a script writer already learned much from that scenario monster.I don't know when we can get another artifact such like this, from the director Frank Darabont or the legend Stephen King,
from selection of the actors to the soundtrack screens stills everything was perfect to me
I hope someday i can be able to produce something like that with one location and tight conversations to convince the audience before the filmmakers , as the audience review are giving you the trust and the encourage to continue and get another great job like that.",9

"I HAVE NOT SEEN MANY FILMS ABOUT PRISON LIFE. I KNOW WHAT I HAVE SEEN FROM TELEVISION (REMEMBER THOSE TV SPECIALS ""SCARED STRAIGHT""?), MAGAZINES, ETC. THEY ALL HAVE ONE SIMPLE THEME: PRISON IS ""HELL"" - AND THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME, FOR WHATEVER REASON, DESERVE THEIR STAY IN ""HELL"".  SOME PEOPLE GO TO PRISON FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS IN THE WORLD AS WELL - SOME ARE UNJUSTLY SENTENCED FOR CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT.

ALSO, IT EXPLORES ANDY'S FRIENDSHIP WITH ELLIS BOYD ""RED"" REDDING - A MAN WHO WENT TO PRISON FOR A CRIME HE COMMITTED. IT'S A STORY OF HOPE IN THE MIDST OF ""HELL"".  A MUST SEE FILM.

"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax. One of the best dramas of all time.Mitchell Bulfin",7
"I watched this movie today, and while it was good it certainly IS NOT the #2 best Drama of all time.  I hope that more people will sign up for IMDB after seeing this and start to post your user ratings as I would give it a good rating, but certianly not a 9.",8
"Freedom is a wonderful thing, and I cannot find an adverb that can be used to deepen its beauty. Although we have lost freedom to a certain extent, we still yearn for freedom.Freedom requires ability. Yes, we need the ability to resist discipline and the system. A strong-willpower person like Andy can give freedom not only to himself but also to others...",10
"Maybe the two most powerful words in the English language. I hope. They say that hope springs eternal. And I believe it. Andy and Red spent decades under the worst conditions possible...the loss of their freedoms...The constant suppression of their souls. But deep in their hearts remained a desire... a wish...a yearning for a new life. And when that opportunity came, they grabbed it with both hands, and embraced it like the second coming. If you could remove a lifetime of regret, and feel free again, what could be better? One man that never LOST hope...and another man that believed in him. Those that lose hope, lose their lives. Like Brooks. This movie is a testament to the unquenchable craving for redemption...and ONE MORE CHANCE. I HOPE that we all get one.",10
"This film offers pretty visuals, good-acting and an interesting screenplay.
But it´s a movie very overrated among IMDB users, who put it at the 2th place on best movies list.The explanation is simple the old ""fight for your dreams"", ""never give up"" motive, which thrills and delight audiences.
SPOILERS AHEAD For me, the movie doesn´t work in this way. At the end, the protagonist is old, he had been raped, bitten, etc. The final doesn´t work for me in a full happy end, the main time of his life has already gone!",10
"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the to p 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of po pular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the to p. It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a pers pective of what it is to be human and to have ho pe for the future even in the face of insurmount able adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but not hing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the ot hers. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine. And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breat hes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes sy mbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was t he short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he does n't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct at mos phere and energy that you can't help but get swe pt away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which ot her films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, des pairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel hap py to be alive. An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.",10
"Hope is dangerous"" Red had ever said,But Andy has always sticked to it. He didn't cry when he was thrown into prison though he was innocent. On contrary, he found ways to kill long time to escape. He helped the head of the prison do the illegal things in order to gain some freedom. He rebuilt a library and helped the other prisoners. All the prisoners liked him, for he helped them find hope again. Perhaps it was time to escape, in a lightening and thundering night, he escaped from the prison through the hole he had dug for twenty years . He was free eventually .
I like Andy very much ,for his talent and his wisedom . And the most important thing that I like is his spirit-never giving up.",9
"This is a great movie, the acting is spot on, the characters are well potrayed and the overall story is very entertaining from beginning to end. This is deffinantly a top movie of the decade.",10
"This is one of the best movies I have come across. The acting of Tim Robbins is excellent but it is Morgan Freeman as Red who steals the show with a breathtaking performance. The story continually kept me interested and Tim Robbins' struggle against nearly every inmate in shawshank. Its possibly only his great friendship with Red that keeps him sane.It was also strange to see one of the sisters in the movie who continually try to rape Tim Robbins, played marine hard man Drake in ""Aliens"", which is also one of my all time favourites.Great movie. Rating 9/10.",10
"A heartbreaking story fraught with Passion, Loss, A Dream, and Friendship. There's only so much i can say about a film that is loved by millions and yet misunderstood by more. It's the visual version of a musical ballad. A soft and thoughtful piece and yet created by a hard centre and churned by the brilliant hands of Frank Darabont and the great acting of both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. A True Classic.""Andy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realises there is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and get to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan Freeman), and Andy epitomises why it is crucial to have dreams. His spirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination, filled with courage and desire. Will Andy ever realise his dreams...?""",10
"The Shawshank Redemption - 1994""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of the things, and no good thing ever dies"", that's what The Shawshank Redemption sums up, but wait! that's, not the only theme it has, let's look over what Director-Writer Frank Darabont offered , based on a 1982 novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King.The story commences with a theme of murder mystery, which leads a banker, Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ), to go to life imprisonment against the charges of murder of his wife and her lover. And as the viewers expecting a murder mystery to be solved, there comes a new theme and a new character in the jail, Red (Freeman). The story now starts taking the picture of friendship faith and hope and shows a different life of prisoners and their emotions toward each other and towards the world, which leads to the friendship of Andy and Red. No spoilers, and after few incidents and a journey of affections and friendship amongst the prisoners, comes the moment of the uprising and, Boom! , the climax turns out to be the eye-opener and viewers for sure will think that, oh yea! That's what the name of the movie is! Correct! But after all that, we again see a little change and the conclusion of the story which is far away from hate and crime and will leave the viewers in a heart-melting situation.
We see the movie through the narration in the background by Red (Freeman), which turned out to be a path for viewers to easily go on. If we look at some technical aspects, we see a great work of lighting and camera, creating some intense scenes in jail locker and an amazing climax scene.Different journeys within a journey, unexpected twist and turns from the very beginning till the end, hats off to the performances, writing and unexpectedly brilliant Direction, making ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a trendsetter.",10
"A hymn to the determination and belief of man, 'Shawshank Redemption' truly deserves its place as the second best film made in the IMDB poll.How on Earth we all missed this one when it was at the cinema is truly baffling; but it has now gained the worldwide recognition it so richly deserves.Robbins is absolutely superb as Andy Dufresne and actually surpasses Freeman's performance (about the only actor to do this) as 'Red'. It's pointless describing the story, suffice to say that it stands head and shoulders above all other movies as a testament to the endurance and power of the human spirit, that almost no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we can endure and prevail. Incredible, thought-provoking and a cornerstone of modern day storytelling.",8
I guess the title of the review speaks for itself so just watch it you'll enjoy it.,9
"This movie is simply outstanding and is one of the best if not the best I've ever seen. Its my joint 3rd favourite with Darabont's other great king adaptation The Green Mile and Seven. This movie is flawless on every level. The key to it though is possibly the greatest ever script ever written by Darabont, and truly outstanding acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. No need to go into the plot. This movie is all about hope and will inspire you to do anything. The brilliant ending is definitely the best i've ever seen and brought a tear to my eye. Watch this movie whenever your happy or sad. It doesn't matter. The film will give you so much hope and happiness. It really is that brilliant. In fact i'm watching it now.WATCH IT NOW 10/10- Probably the greatest movie ever made",8
This film is very good and I think the story is very interesting.,10
"Well... this is the cat out of the bag. Pandora's box opening. Why did I ever find a critique site. I'm one of the most opinionated stubborn sh...uhh so and so's.... in the world.So I guess first and foremost did I like it. No!..........Just kidding. How can you fail to? Its my favourite movie of all time. It has just occurred to me that this may be my first ever sober critique of the film. It's one of those movies confined to the small, smokey, pokey corners of a pub when the issue of greatest film of all time comes up. There's always a 'goodfellas' and a 'Godfather trilogy' and an 'Empire Strikes back' 'Labyrinyth' (?) Voice in the crowd ,(I mix in strange circles) But its fairly unanimous, everyone likes this film. So why?Where do I start. Morgan Freeman...Goes without saying. Tim Robbins...Not sure anyone else could play Dufresne now. Bob Gunton....Born to play evil. William sadler...Under-rated.But it's not really the actors or the Director/photography etc. It's the script. Beautifully constructed. It flows like liquid perfection. Morgan Freeman's VO helps no end. (Brad Pitt described it in 'Se7en' commentry as the voice of god).I had the fortune to watch this before the hype. I got it out on video the day it came out cause I was a fan of Morgan Freeman. I sat there in silence for fifteen minutes after the final credit had scrolled past my screen. It's that good. Breathtaking. (spoiler) When Red wanders across that beach and we see Dufresne there, and the camera slowly pans upwards and away, you know you've been part of something special. I'm not a fan of sickly sweet 'hollywoodised' endings but every now and then they get it right.I should stop now cause I could go on for ever. (The 'record' scene, Brook's parole, the 'beers on the roof', the 'poster', the 'salvation comes from within' rock hammer).I better stop there. Need to take a tablet. See thats why they shouldn't make movies this good.Yeah I quite liked it then.Don't mind and comments/critique/feedback. The e-mails there.",8
"Ya know, I never heard of the Shawshank Redemption before I came to the IMDB. I looked at the top 250 and saw it ahead of 1994's Forrest Gump and in the number 2 spot all time and thought, ""man, what is this?"" I found out a couple weekends ago and I'm not in the least bit disapointed. It was great, I loved it. I can say nothing that hasn't been said already. Great film, I wish I had seen it earlier. Awesome! Haven't seen it? SEE IT!",10
"but the #2 movie of all-time ??!!? It's all opinion, of course.  However, I doubt even Stephen King or Tim Robbins would vote for this enjoyable saga as the #2 all-time movie.  It is a marvelous adaptation of King's short story.  Robbins, Freedman, and Gunton are all terrific, as is James Whitmore in his short role. 
My biggest criticism is the slow detailing of Red's every move after being released from prison, and before going after the fortune.  That part was a bit labored and overlong.  Nonetheless, the movie was witty, exciting, and well-acted, but was purposefully limited in scope.  Very good, yes! Excellent? Perhaps.  Great?  I must demur on great.",9
"This film is based on Stephen King's story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It was part of a collection of four short novels, among them Apt Pupil (adapted by Bryan Singer) and The Body (made into Stand By Me by Rob Reiner). Shawshank was a great story and the film adaption by Frank Darabont is brilliant. The film is highlighted by the strong performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.This movie has everything you could want in a film: inspiring story of people persevering through bad times, strong directing and acting (two of the very best actors of today) and one of the classic endings I've seen in a movie.Shawshank is well-made and inspiring. It has joined my personal movie hall-of-fame, which includes The Grapes of Wrath, High Noon, Goodfellas, L.A. Confidential and Bugsy. I also reccomend The Green Mile, Darabont's most recent King adaption.",10
"Great characters.  Beautifully filmed.  Moving...sad, yet beautiful and top shelf story telling.  There has to be enough accolades to warrant viewing this here so I won't blather on about what a great flick this was except to say it was.  Watch it and if you don't agree on it's placement...you must be...unbelievable.",10
"A slow burn thriller tells the tale of a two-man miscommunication that leaves the world's most valuable stone unguarded in a Maine field. Andy and Red build a decades-long friendship over Andy's love of rocks and Red's capitalist desire to profit on said love. When Andy improbably escapes Shawshank's oppressive walls, Red puts together the clues (or does he?) to find what he thinks is the buried treasure.After a grueling parole battle and a long-con grocery bagging job taken solely to throw off the scent of the federal rock-hounds, Red eventually makes his way by non-air-conditioned bus to the field of destiny. However, in the biggest case of missing the obvious since The Crying Game, Red discards the stone of the gods in favor of a dirty tin containing a meager pittance that was only intended to get Red (and more importantly the rock) south of the border.When Red arrives on the Mexican beach for what should be a tear-jerking reunion, Andy kills Red like he killed his wife after realizing that Red left the precious rock behind.9/10",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is simply a fabulous piece of cinematic story telling. The casting is excellent, the characters are believable, the story is compelling, and the cinematography is spot on.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, and his battle to survive a wrongful conviction and life sentence in Shawshank Prison. He forms a close friendship with another lifer - Red - and an uneasy relationship with prison boss Warden Norton. His finds his own way to survive the physical and mental pressures imposed upon him.It is not always the case with films that we root for 'the good guy', but in this case you surely will. The good and the bad is so skillfully delineated in this film, and the characters so deeply developed, that it simply draws you further and further in. A brilliant movie.",9
Its my all time favorite movie. The twists and turns in the movie will amaze you to the core.,10
"Two words: Flawless masterpiece.  While not the greatest movie ever made, it should certainly rank extremely high.  Unless you're completely repulsed by the idea of a prison film, or if you're too immature to appreciate good drama, you're going to absolutely love, love, love this film.  This film was largely overlooked at the time because of the mega-popular ""Forrest Gump"" (an extremely excellent film in its own right), but it holds up because of a timeless quality that very few films possess (I know the film's only 7 years old, but I think that's long enough).  If you're uncomfortable with some of the more graphic themes of the movie, it's still worth a look (certain cable networks regularly show an edited for TV version of the movie).  This is a must see for anyone who calls themselves a film-buff.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is a true Stephen King film. Darabont's effort in the screenplay was astonishing. I love this film. The whole story has twists and turns and surprises in every corner. The best prison movie, most definitely. Robbins delivered a powerful performance. He should have won an Oscar for this film. I loved it and I hoped, I'm sure, that everyone else loved it. I give this film a solid, gold TEN. Highly recommended for those who have taste in movies. If you have any comments for me, please e-mail me at tylerripen@yahoo.com.",10
The actors were excellent. For the most part these actors stay out of politics. You have to feel sorry for the prisoners in the film. But remember they are criminals.,9
"Who knew that this would one day be the highest rated movie on IMDb, so famous and loved by so many people. I think this is a must watch for everyone since we all can relate to it at least once throughout.This has the hidden meaning too, which I hope you find at the end of movie. It was lovely and I still re-watch it whenever I feel down, never got bored. It will always stay in my top 5 movies of all time. The way the characters develop over time, especially with Morgan Freeman's voice narrating it, movie gets immense depth ranging from the story to the characters.Absolutely, these actors have us a fine masterpiece one that is worth the time.",8
"yes this movie is one of the greatestThis movie changed my thinking about people who go to prison. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance no matter what it is. They need to be given a chance to change themselves. Morgan Freeman did justice to his role i was really touched at the end part when he's there for the parole and the words that came out of his mouth. Tim Robbins was tremendous, its the first time i noticed him as an actor and he's one of the best.prison is terrible place to be its like a whole new world and my perspective has changed about that. I rate this movie 10/10 its the best, the story is great and the director does a great job. well done",9
"Spoiler Alert A few films can presume of the importance that a film like The Shawshank Redemption does. Shawshank Redemption is considered by some critics as one of the best movies in the story of American film (listed as #2 by the Internet Movie Data Base,http://www.imdb.com). For many other people the film is considered as one of those films which theme is universal and that transcends throughout the ages and decades. And this is because topics like freedom, justice and injustice, greed and honesty, and perseverance are mixed in a manner that specifies what the human condition is and will be.The performances given by Tim Robbins and the always acclaimed Morgan Freeman give the film the emotional touch that is easy to get as a viewer. The story is centered in a person called Andy Dufrense who was convicted for the murder of his wife, him, being a young and intelligent banker was one of the most promising persons in his category, but all his potential was brought down with his conviction, undoubtely unfair since it is obvious a person like Dufrense wouldn´t be capable of such a thing like murdering the person he loved with all his heart. Also the story of the ""institutionalized"" Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman, a man who lost all hope of ever going out even if he had already payed more than he had ever expected for his crime, until he met Dufrense, who as anyone could see teaches Red the meaning of what to have a dream is, even if it takes you 20 years to accomplish it.Greed comes in form of Captain Byron Hadley played by lancy Brown, an unscrupulous man, who ironicly although he directed the place were the ""bad"" element of society is reformed he was no better than the ones he subdued. Hadley since he first met Dufrense sought in him his golden egg gouse and used him to fulfill a fraud becoming Dufrense now into a real criminal, which he wasn´t until he got to jail. When the opportunity to prove Dufrense´s innocence comes, Hadley makes everything as possible to avoid that even though the assesination of a young person was in the middle. At the end, Dufrense escapes from jail through a hole he had dug for 20 years covering the evidence with several posters from the hollywood divas from those times from Rita Hayworth to Jane Fonda.But, let´s talk about Andy Dufresne for a while, let´s take the scene at the roof of the building in which Andy gets beers for his coworkers in exchange for work. At the end of the scene we can see the smile of Andy, a happy man, who was happy with small little accomplishments. Andy was someone who was talented and yet, all he wanted was a yat in Puerto Vallarta near by the beach and that would be the heaven for him. In a world full of intelligent people who use their talents to get to the top, andy was one who needed little to be happy.Of course the success of this film is based on what most of the famous films do, an utopic idea of society or how the human being should have been. Andy is the prototype of how all of us should be, never loose the sense of hope, always fight for what you want, greed and money is not good, and of course, being like this you will always succeed. After all, a movie that should be seen by everyone.",10
"I have just finished watching this movie. It is amazingI really did not think it was going to be this good. After hearing so many great reviews from friends and relatives alike, I've finally decided to watch it. I love it.The story is amazing the main character Andrew is a pure genius. He manages to build a library in the prison, do taxes for prisoners, guards, and warden alike, comes with perfect escape plan, and exploits Warden's corruption, fakes his identity, and finally gives a gift to his friend Red.I thought the performance were amazing too. Morgan Freeman is just amazing at every act he does. Other actors were pretty damn good as wellwell-deserving 10 out of 10",9
"This movie is a must watch.timeless.
No regret. Best of the best.one of thoses movies taht you will remember forever",10
"I watched ShawRed as the first movie on my PC when i bought it. Some how the engineer who formatted my drive put this movie along with few other movies for me to see as he had limited collection of movies. I watched this movie and I simply loved it, especially the end. Along with time this movie has grown over me and the more i think about it, the more i like it. It truly deserves all the recognition it is getting, though i do not consider it better than Godfather but still i find it a masterpiece movie. Great acting by both leads, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. In fact, everyone acted well in this movie. The direction deserves standing ovation and Frank Darabont, the director also deserves hats off for his very gripping screenplay. It is very difficult to maintain much interest of audience in same interior scenes if they keep repeating themselves but DOP has done a fine job too. All n all a master movie and for new generation it is a must watch to know what movies were made just twenty years back.",9
"When I had finished watching the movie,I was excited and wanted to watch it again.Wheather the figures and details or the spirit that the music conveyed to.""Hope is dangerous"" Red had ever said,But Andy has always sticked to it.He didn't cry when he was thrown into prison though he was innocent.On contrary,he found ways to kill long time to escape.He helped the head of the prison do the illegal things in order to gain some freedom.He rebuilt a library and helped the other prisoners.All the prisoners liked him,for he helped them find hope again.Perhaps it was time to escape,in a lightening and thundering night,he escaped from the prison through the hole he had dug for twenty years .He was free eventually .
I like Andy ,for his talent and his wisedom .And the most important thing that I like is his spirit-never giving up.",9
"God, what a beautiful film! The performances are very good both from the main characters and the supporting characters, the photography is very good but what caught me the most is the whole of it all and the story. A story that we will hardly forget and with good messages such as the conviction in what we believe and the great power of friendship.",9
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a successful banker who is innocently sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of murdering his wife and lover. Although the film refers to corruption in the system, it seeks to give meaning to life in its world of meaning. Andy Dufresne manages to escape from prison in the worst and most difficult conditions of prison with life imprisonment and reaches liberation and freedom. Unlike other prisoners, he can pass through the bars, barbed wire and walls and swim a long distance in the sewage and excrement to expose his naked body to the rain after his release and his gaze from the cold and gray space. Shawshank sewed the walls of the prison deep into the blue sky because he found the reason for life, and according to Nietzsche, whoever found the reason for life will build it anyway.",10
"I wanted to rate this a 10 but seriously I rated Good-fellas a 9. So I am not even sure why people rated this so high. I mean 9 is about right but at 9.3 that would mean a bunch of people gave it a 10. Seriously we are talking about the godfather and plenty of other great movies. Gladiator and so on. And its a 5 star movies (as I would like to say basing it off the hotel rankings). but 10, OK.Normally I click the spoiler alert on her just because right over it says black list and frankly when I hear the phrase ""blacklisted"" i think of Al Capone, so no thanks on that part. Which leads us right into the character Andy. He was accused of killing his wife and her lover. Plus the scene was set in the late 40's. Perfect time to set a script. I love the classic cars. You don't get people saying ""that would never happen"" most people weren't even alive then. Along as they aren't talking on their cell phone in the movie, then most of the time people just watch. Andy gets falsely accused mostly to his cold demeanor in the court room. Its 2017 and I watch Snapped, forensic files and I was a avid court TV watcher before they changed, and if you go to court in the fashion he did with a judge deciding your fate (i didn't see the jury read the verdict on that one maybe i missed that part) you are definitely not going to get any sympathy from the court. Which in his case and now you need all the sympathy you can get. He does all the taxes and even money laundering for the warden when he eventually plots and escapes prison only to get that money out of an account and then go on to live life on a beach. Why let another person steal your credit for hard work when you can get credit for your own work. I wouldn't suggest breaking out of prison to do it (that would be a felony) but high stakes high rewards, right?Also with Andy's character. He made you feel different and you wanted to watch him. He was not predictable. When turned up that music in the wardens office I was like ""wow that took some guts to do."" And also about the guys who kept torturing him and raping him, that made you feel different about things. This was a person who was struggling. And you wanted to see how it ended. What makes this film great is its dark and it brings you into the movie. Books have a lot more time and lot of ways to get you into the book with words than movies can do with video. Words lead to imagination and simply can give you a very vivid image. Video is what you see and what you get. Hard to duplicate a book so the best you can do is be dark about about describe people the best you can do in a 2 hour time block. Sounds easy but its not. When you watch this movie you feel like you are in prison. They don't waste time talking about the food in prison. We got it, I am sure the food isn't exactly like a restaurant in the Hampton. They spent most of their time explaining Andy.This is another story about a person who didn't fit in with what society has labeled him and he told people the truth and they didn't believe him. So he figured another way to bring the people who held him captive while fixing his own life. It didn't happen over night. He didn't just take what life gave him, he took what life gave him and used it against them and kept a memory of it and wrote everything down. My favorite part is when Tim ribbons is talking to Morgan freeman saying "" i had to come prison to learn to be a criminal."". I got chills from hearing that. Cause that is the truth. A smart banker mixed with criminals is very dangerous. They know all the laws, the loop holes and they have the patience and confidence to do it. I wouldn't rank this movie higher than the godfather like a lot of people have it on here. But its ranked as a 5 star movie to movie. Which puts it in the category of the godfather, casino, Good-fellas, Brave-heart, and the Gladiator. Then again this film is unique, the prison guards beat the lights out of people after the light are out.",8
An absolute masterpiece from start to finish. A perfect ten.,10
I don't like this movie erase it this sucks y does this exist ahhhhh,10
"Please, you have to watch it onetime in your life!",7
"This is one of my fave movies because its so beautiful. The acting , the story and the filmmaking. This is how all movies should be made...with heart. The story is so simple but its shaped and made a master piece.If you have not seen this movie, and you are 15 or 55 years old,I'm telling you that you are missing a lot.I give it ********** out of ********** because it moved me so much, the way its showing the human nature, the good and the ugly side of it.",9
This movie might be the best movie I've ever seen.,10
"The plot, dialogs, acting, characters, flow,... everything is perfect and well balanced to create a unique movie. Already a classic.",1
"Far and away, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" deserved, with every fiber of its being, to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. Morgan Freeman, who, until ""Million Dollar Baby,"" had been robbed of an Oscar for films such as ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" had his pinnacle performance for ""TSR."" Beautifully crafted, totally captivating, and flowing effortlessly with Freeman's narration, ""TSR,"" for all its gray colors, paints an exuberant portrait of life behind bars--the wrongly convicted Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) adapts to prison life, all the while calculating an escape that spans three decades. Keeping his friends close, and enemies closer, Dufrane takes a seemingly innocent hobby and turns it into a redemption that takes him to Mexico, with Red (Freeman) serving his time and following suit.If there is a film that speaks more to the believer in all of us, I haven't encountered it yet. It doesn't matter what hour of the evening, or what mood I'm in, if ""TSR"" is playing...I'm watching, and loving it just as much as the first time around.It's been fourteen years...if you haven't seen it, ask yourself, ""What the hell's wrong with me?""",10
"Well it was not until recently I saw this one....a few of my friends had seen it and were completely raving about it....finally saw it a few days back...it takes some time to fully absorb it....what an outstanding cinematic achievement....!!! It is a complete pity that the movie released in the year of 1994, because it was robbed of a well deserved Oscar, given pulp fiction and and Forrest gump also released the same year.....this movie has everything. ...memorable performances, characters, a good story....it also has a lot of repeat value...this is a kind of movie which you can go back to whenever you are down in life...there are a few cinematic liberties taken....but thats pardonable.",10
This film is a rough griddy prison film and it was designed to feel so. A powerful message and honorable effort with acting and set design deserve to be recognized but I cant help but wonder how this film got to this spot. From my view of movies the true putstanding masterpieces are like the Mona Lisa or Starry Night. Pieces that you can identify in every instance or location. Shawshank was very much a blur for me. Although the film indvidually was by no means a low quality film. I find it falls short of other films on the top 250. I wouldnt even put it in the top 5 of its genre nore the top 5 of its decade. This film still has value but Im wondering if it suffers from mass overating or bandwagoning.,3
I have watched thousands of movies till date but this movie is beyond everything. I just love the way presented the story and every second of this movie was very fascinating and kept me hooked for an entire part.I have watched this movie five years ago and still never found better alternative for good entertainment. I think the movies like this should be made in a form of web series because the content is much more and the characters should be more elaborated in a series.I think someone should try to make a web series on a story of Shawshank Redemption and I think it will be loved by everyone.,10
"This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first 10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made. A must watch film!!! 10/10",8
"When I look at the IMDB Top 250 list, I am generally dismayed by both the films that are missing and those that should not be there. However, I am delighted to see The Shawshank Redemption right up at number 2. This movie is absolutely superb, far surpassing the story on which it was based. The plot is brilliant, and once again it shows Morgan Freeman to be one of the greatest actors of all time; it amazes me that he has been given so few awards.When Tim Robbins was interviewed, he called this a ""love story"", and that is exactly what it is - a story of a wonderful (and completely non-sexual) love between two men, a love that is born in an incredible hell-hole and helps to raise them out of it. It's the sort of movie you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.",10
"Well, what can one say, seen it now umpty times over the years and it remains one of the best m9vies ever. Not only is the story gripping but the acting, out of this world mostly. Not only gripping, drama, humour, it has it all. It is so well played you feel like that you are locked up with them. Get the popcorn out, have a nice cold beer ready, you are going to love this and sit through it in one session!",10
"I saw it again to try to remember if it is such a great movie. Well... it is a great movie. Stories, acting, directing. But... definitely not thet movie ever.",10
"I just wonder now, why I still didnt try to watch it, considering I was in love with Stephen's stories in my childhood.
The episode looks really realistic and profound, like I love. The characters are deep, not two-dimensioned, like it is always now.
In one moment of the movie(Andy led some talks about setting free from the prison with Morgan) I was wondering If Freeman was expressing his real emotions, because it really looked like that.
So. I recommend it to everyone without any doubt! enjoy the watching and amazing play!",10
"A long road to freedom, a deep washing of the soul.This is an immortal inspirational classic",8
Nice movie. I have seen it 5 times. Thats just owsume movie.,8
"One of the so-called greatest films of all time - at last one I can agree with.The movie is a classic blockbuster: great acting, great plot, great dialogue and great directing.The writing is fantastic, the screenplay translates so well from the original text without losing much.One for the history books and for your permanent collection.",7
One of the most compelling watches ever. Such a wonderful perspective on the human condition. Morgan Freeman's narration is stunning. Tim Robbins is brilliant. This film is somehow restorative to the spirit.,10
"<<WARNING: EXTREME SPOILERS>>I won't argue that this is a really good film. It is. But I've always felt it's been built up a bit too much. It's well-structured, well-paced, and Morgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, along with all of his co-stars. But it's still something of a modern fairy tale. We never doubt that things will turn out all right in the end for Andy and Red, or that Norton will get his comeuppance. This, combined with a tendency to get cloying, particularly with the opera record and the spunky kid, effectively knocks it out of the running as one of the all-time greats.All this aside, however, it's impact can't be denied either. Frank Darabont may have let his sentimentality go raging out of control on The Green Mile next, but he just enough restraint here to move us almost to tears. And this same emotional black-and-white treatment allows plot points that might have been laughed of in a more cynical film to feel perfectly satisfying. Tell me you didn't raise a fist in triumph when Norton blew his brains out. And regarding sentiment, it certainly wasn't 1994's worst offender. Matching Forrest Gump for saccharine value would tax even Darabont's skills.",10
"Somehow, I missed this film the first go around. Very impressed.....I only hope that prisons have improved in the last 70 years....but I fear they have not. This is a cautionary tale for any person hell bent on going to prison. Rise up and do some good where you are standing. It is a long, bleak, lonely time in prison.",10
"***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** Imagine me as an old man with a beard sitting on the stoep (porch) waving my cane at people passing by.""How dare you call the Shawshank Redemption an unorginal prison fairytale! It is not supposed to be a run of the mill prison movie. Its not supposed to be The Birdman of Alcatraz! It's not supposed to be MIDNIGHT EXPRESS! It's not even supposed to be Stir Crazy, you wippersnappers! The prison is only the backdrop! It's about overcoming the odds when you are at your rope's end. This is a movie about hope and finding it in the darkest and dreariest of places.""This movie could easily have been set in Nazi Germany in opressed Germany, in a concentration camp, in a 19th century work house! It's about breaking free from things that oppress us needlessly! (Spoiler starts here) Andy is the only person in prison that doesn't belong there! If he had done something bad he would have accepted it, but he didn't, so he tunnels through a wall to freedom. (Spoiler ends here).""Sentimentalism can be bad in a movie if handled incorrectly, but Darabont uses it better than other Capra impersonators out there (even beating the Coens with their Hudsucker Proxy). And there is nothing wrong with sentimentality in The Shawshank Redemption. And I can't see what cliches you are talking about. Just because good things happen doesn't mean they cliches.""This is a meditative movie. It's also has a lot of little things to enjoy for repeat viewing. So get off your high-horse and enjoy this movie.""This is all I have to say.""Get back onto his chair and blows bubbles out of his pipe.",10
10/10 - Must Watch. The performances in this film are simply amazing. The story is tragic and memorable. The directing is one of the best I've ever seen. It's perfect.,9
"I loved the movie and it's concept. The storyline was outstanding.Morgan Freedman did an outstanding job as best supporting actor. And Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, did a remarkable job.And the rest of the cast did great also. The movie was just awesome.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!
Overall, The Shawshank Redemption not a movie, it's a emotion.",10
Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen. Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.,10
"It feels like I am watching a real thing happening in front of you. It doesn't seem to be acting at all. It is not surprising that this is a movie until the list of crew members at the end of the film comes out. The genius of the mind, the familiar business ability, the perseverance of perseverance, and the determination to bear the burden of humiliation eventually led to a perfect escape that lasted for 20 years. The hero finally regained his freedom, and the bad guys also suffered from their own consequences. It is better to say that the protagonist thought of the final ending from the beginning.",10
"This movie (The Shawshank Redemption) is not the best ever. What are people thinking about? Of course it is better than 1 star - but 10???? It is a nice movie, with a fine happy ending. But to make it number one in the world, is a bit too much. There can be only one number one - and that is without a doubt The Godfather.Please everyone, try to consider your votes again - I hate to see that things are not in the right perspective. If IMDb should be accepted as the world real Bibel for film lovers, The Shawshank Redemption can't be our top movie. A lot of other movies are far better. Among them; The Godfather part 2, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Fight Club, The Prestige, Once Upon a Time in The West - and many more. Please change your votes........",10
"When I heard that this movie bombed at the box office during its theatrical run, I was very surprised as this is simply an all time classic. Rarely is narration in a movie been done as well as this, Morgan Freeman simply becomes Ellis Redding whose depiction of a hardened con who has accepted that he may never get out and goes through his parole hearings not caring about the outcome. Tim Robbins becomes Andy Dufresne and his portrayal of a man who is really out of his depth and his element, and finding adjusting to life on the inside difficult, almost impossible. The changing relationship between the two characters from initial hostility to deep almost brother like friendship is captivating. Clancy Brown's depiction of the tyrannical Captain Baron Hadley is amazing and likewise Bob Gunton as the hypocritical bible bashing, Warden Norton. The other characters like wise are also well done, especially Brooks and sadistic inmate Boggs. The depiction is what you'd expect from a prison movie and while depicting a life of boring monotony and routine show occasionally punctuated by brief moments of excitement is still fascinating thanks to the soundtrack and of course Morgan Freeman's narration, and I don't want to spoil the ending but it climaxes perfectly with not a dry eye in sight, thanks to the pacing, and the dialogue can't be faulted. Now in regard to the differences from the book, these are for the most part minor and if anything enhance the story rather than hinder it, a rarity. In summary this is a must watch for all movie lovers.",10
Even I thought Albert Einstein's IQ is a child infront of Andy's IQ...,10
The cast as this movie is legendary if they had picked anyone else for any of the parks it would not be one of the best movies made🖤🎟🎬🎥🌟🌟🌟🌟💜💜💜💜💜💜,10
"This is one of the best movie ever made, it's a story about hope.I procrastinated for a few years thinking that this movie might just be a overrated one but boy was I wrong. This is an engaging good hearted film based on a novel by Stephen King.The story commences with a theme of murder mystery but slowly unfolds into a picture of friendship, faith & hope. We see a plethora of characters that gives /us different life of prisoners, officers their emotions & journey within journey. The climax is one of the best I've ever seen it's an eye opener and we'll surely think of that for a very long time.Highly recommend it, maybe the best movie I've ever seen.
10/10",8
Good movie but grade doesn't fit the reality that this movie is not the best of all time. It deserves 7 Top but I will give lower grade just to put it where it belongs hopefully.,10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are in a dynamic role in this film. I could not imagine a lot of innocent people inside a gigantic prison of history. When I saw Clancy Brown first time, looked so tough, he's big too. I also like Clancy's role, too. He should be a great fighter. What is good for Andy Dufrense (Robbins) is that he makes an unbelievable escape route to run away from prison, finally.",4
"...followed,very closely,behind by Stand By Me.The novella Rita Hayworth... is one of his best as well,so when I heard that it was being made into a film,i was worried at how it came out.All that worrying was for nothing.Superb performances(Sorry, but where was the Oscars for Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Frank Darabont etc),a script that sticks to the novella but doesn't get bogged down in over plotting(like Pet Semetary) and some brilliant direction make this one of the truly great films of the 1990's.Pity about The Green Mile (1999)...",10
"Never has in mind that a live inside a prison is better than outside world, and never has in mind that hope is something that we can have even in the darkest moment. I can relate to every assuming guilty people through this movie, because losing brook has made my heart ache. This movie has given me motivation like a bird flying through the cage. I am very grateful to myself that i have chosen this movie over avengers, or else ""i have never seen a shoe of a man"".
Sincerely, you dear friend",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a superb motion picture. The story is great. I love movies like this where you root for the underdog, in this case wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne, skillfully played by Tim Robbins. The cunning of Dufresne is amazing, and the movie throws in a nice moral lesson on the importance of friendship. Also the directing and cinematography are great.  Everyone should see this. bye.",10
I would recommend this film. It has a good plot and in the end all the small things you never noticed all add up. So overall it's a good film. It has a good meaning to it which a lot of films nowadays lack. However during the first hour of the film I found it quite boring. It was as if the film was leading to something and although things happened it just didn't interest as me as much. In saying that the film really does have a good meaning which is why I like it so much.Although I would recommend this film there are other films which have a similar meaning which I personally think are better.I gave it 7 out of 10 simply because this film is above the average film but it's not exceptional.,1
"I enjoyed this film because it shows the way I believe our Judicial system should be;tough, and stern. The two main characters,Red and Andy, form a friendship bond that carries them through the ordeal of prison life. They stick together and help one another.The great scene I enjoy, is when Red comes up for parole and the last time, they set him free. The officials may have thought He served his time enough, and He was older anyway.Red gave a great speech, how he regretted what he did and was very sorry.When he said he would ""talk some sense"" into that guy who committed that crime,I think that moved the officials to change their minds.Morgan Freeman is wonderful in this film and I love Robbins' performance,here.",10
"One of, if not, the best movies I have ever come across. A very heart warming and inspirational film that never ceases to put a smile on my face no matter how many times I see it. Fill with memorable scenes and dialog. Acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman alone make this movie a great gem. The story is focused in a prison, but the focus of the film is hope, patience, redemption ( as in the title), and friendship. The movie contains a lot of symbolism, but it identifies itself quite clearly. I urge you if you call yourself a film fanatic to go watch this movie if you have never seen it. It has some the best characters to it.",10

"Excellent, powerful drama about two mens' friendship and escape from Shawshank prison.  Robbins and Freeman excel in perfect roles.  Sharp script and touching subplots add to this enduring film.  Freeman's narration illuminates beauty and power of Stephen King short story upon which it is based.  Directed by Frank Darabont (""The Green Mile"").",10
"A movie is considered amazing when it not only entertains you but also teaches you something important about life. This movie taught me that Hope is the best thing you can possess in life. This is one of the most fantastically written and performed movies, I have come across. It is a true piece of Cinema.",9
"Fear makes you a prisoner, hope frees you, hope is a good thing, perhaps the best thing, and good things will never die.
When someone committed suicide, I almost couldn't help crying. People live in fear is really very bad, out of harmony with the environment, fear everything around them, it feels like an invisible hand, pinching his neck at any time, if can't find an exit, mental breakdown, the rest is only despair
I feel very gratified, even some lucky, Rhett was not defeated by this fear. I also want to thank Andy, who left a straw for Rhett in his life and death.
The Lord loves the world. In front of the supreme Lord, everyone has original sin, and we repent to ourselves. Never give up hope, save yourself, save your soul.",10

"It's so shocking that the male master escapes through the sewer. It has to be said that his obsession with freedom overcomes everything. Even if he stays in prison, because he keeps learning and doesn't break away from the outside world, he can face everything so calmly. Even in the small world of prison, he is the master himself.",10
"My beloved ""The Shawshank Redemption"" There are so many talks about the perfect storyline, but let's focus on the the great acting. More specifically tim robbins, the first scene of Andy and that look! That look was just so deep and influential,looking at the eyes of a man who is in the big grief of his loss,as he mentioned later how he was in love with her,also being condemned for a huge murder and the last but the most important one, being totally innocent in the means of physically killing someone!Those last scenes of the movie when he got outside after plenty of years were just mind-blowing.And the great Morgan freeman,he lived Red through the film. Honestly his acting is so deep,fresh and credible. His dialogues were just so deep and meaningful and the way he went through them made them even deeper.",10
"I consider a technically well made movie, good story with great actors, but nothing more. Use the melodic drama injustice, but not quite spectacular, as a masterpiece of cinema. I think a great movie for afternoon session, but not the level of movies that have the best score of all time. This I consider an injustice. This film has to have something else to be an excellent movie. I respect the majority opinion here, but I put my sincere considerations, here is a democratic space to put our feelings and emotions. Film is a passion, and I'm sure we'll be together to honest debate with many other films. I liked this movie, but without much enthusiasm, as in the comments here. For me, a movie only average ...",10
"Hope is a good thing as said by Andy and I hoped that I will like this movie again rewatching it after years. It still does , like s charm. No action , No VFX, No ott moments still in the 2020's this works like old wine. That moment when Andy breathes a sign of relief in the rain after escaping still gives you reason to live your life for. The climax too. After all these years it is surprising that the film didn't win a single Oscar award ,even though it stand against had equally great films ( eg- Forrest Gump ), but it doesn't matter now though ( but it also gives an idea on what a splendid year 1994 was for movies). What this has done in the future is history and it has emerged as one of the greatest movies ever made and ya it is still the highest rated movie on IMDb and I would still want to watch it again after few years to stay motivated in my life...",9
"This movie, based on a short stoy by Stehpen King, is easily one on the best movies made in the modern era of Hollywood.  It incorporates a touching story of friends and hope, top-notch acting, excellent directing and most important; a screenplay worthy of high marks.  With beautiful photography and a story that is best described as ""uplifting"". this is one of my favorite movies EVER.  The best line in the movie goes ""it all comes down to one thing; get busy living or get busy dyin'"".  A rating of 10 out of 10 was given.",10
"This movie was a little overrated, but it was still wonderful.  What can I say that hasn't already been said.  It was a lot like the Green Mile, only it has some more interesting plot twists and such.  It had a great ending. It deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, and I enjoyed it more than Forrest Gump (which, I think won that year), but I think Pulp Fiction should have won that year.",10
"The year is 1947 and ""tall glass of water with a silver spoon up his ass"" Andy Dufresne is sentenced to serve two back-to-back life sentences in Shawshank Penitentiary for the 'cold-blooded' murder of his wife and her lover. We are shown flashbacks to the events leading up to their slaying, but not enough for us to convict Andy along with the judge and this makes for an intriguing character watching the movie for the first time 'round. Inside the walls of Shawshank, Andy still claims his innocence, only to find he isn't alone. But it isn't long before he approaches go-to-guy Ellis 'Red' Redding for a rock hammer and Rita Hayworth poster, eventually becoming best buddies with him.The theme of the piece is freedom and what it means to the men inside. The elderly 'Brooks' Hatlen is what Darabont calls ""the spine of the story"", who walks the straight and narrow path upon his release from prison but whose institutionalisation holds him back from enjoying free life and participating in the outside world. Red is also ""an institutional man"" whose constant rejections from the parole board have led him to believe that hope is a bad thing. Whereas seemingly infinite oasis of hope Andy, who after being raped constantly by 'the Sisters' and being sent way down in the hole a buncha times, still maintains his spirit. ""Salvation lies within"", as the Warden says.However, there is also a physical journey Brooks, Red and Andy take. Prison represents Hell in this very symbolically Christian story, the halfway-house Brooks and Red go through, Purgatory, and Zihuatanejo, the ""warm place with no memory"" is of course, Heaven. Andy is even baptised after escaping the walls of the prison when he falls out of the sewage pipe into the water of the crick in the pouring rain. The most seemingly Christian man in the movie, Warden, is actually the Devil with sadistic Captain Hadley as his Beelzebub. Writer and director Frank Darabont uses posters of sex symbols Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch to mark the passage of time Andy serves (just under twenty years) inside, while Andy uses them to cover up his escape route. 'The Shawshank Redemption' may appear to be in colour at first, but it is very much a black-and-white old-school Capra story, with modern blood, profanity and references to sodomy. Bad guys are bad guys and good guys are good guys. The Hollywood way is a timeless thing. People climb out of sewers without a trace of turd on them and show no visible signs of ageing in twenty years.The movie has the same values of Capra, whom Darabont acknowledges as a major influence, and that isn't a bad thing when you stand it up against the largely nihilistic or simply stylistic movies of it's era, ergo all of QT's work, Scorsese's gangster pictures of that decade etc. The American film industry of the time's fondness for the downer ending, or lack of one was probably what drove the public out to the rental stores in the mid-nineties in search of this after the perhaps off-puttingly schmaltzy Gumpfest of this movie's year in the cinema failed to relate to many on a human level. 'Shawshank' has the necessary grit and real-life situations for a modern audience to get into it, but it also tells them what to think and feel with it's near constant narration and score like a movie from the forties might have. This is perhaps why it is such a firm favourite of the casual viewer, as it carries them along rather than allowing them to figure anything out or decide on their own ending. What the enormous popularity of the picture proves is that viewers would rather not be challenged but rather placated.",10
"I expected The Shawshank Redemption to obviously exceed to some level of greatness as it's the highest rated movie of all time. The movie had me and i believe most people hooked from the beginning as it starts with a cliffhanger and a very stressed and confused man drunk in his car. The movie really shows the audience how police brutality and prisons were in the 40's, and how they used to treat people. I wish i could say something bad about the movie as i feel every movie or show you watch should have at least one thing to point on, but i feel the director of The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont) added everything that the film needed and for most people who have watched the movie succeeded expectations. If you are thinking about watching this movie I would 100% recommend as it's a movie i feel everyone should see at least once in their life.",10

"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I was twelve when I first saw this movie in 1998. I was flipping through the channels on my TV when I was first introduced to the character of Andy Dufresne. I watched with amazement and was fully absorbed by the happenings and events that took place. When a commercial break came on, I was impatient for it to end so I could find out what would be next. The beginning of the movie has Andy being imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover. He says he didn't do it. And I believed he did, until the plot twister changed my whole perspective. Red is the man narrorating, and to me, is the main character about how is life is changed around over the twenty years he knows Andy. And if it's anything that made me cry, it was at the end where Red is finally free. This film started my compassion for movies with meaning behind them, and if you view this picture, be ready for a new look on life.In other words, DON'T pass this movie by. Enjoy!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is not only the greatest film of the last decade, but in time, this may become, in the eyes of moviegoers, the best movie ever made.  The story of wrongfully accussed banker Andy Dufresne, and his friendship formed with con Ellis Boyd Redding in Shawshank Prison, has become as universally acclaimed and loved as any other in recent history. This is the 'Casablanca' of it's time.  A near-perfect movie that can be watched hundreds of times and never lose it's impact.  Perhaps its the way the movie handles the timeless theme of hope, and the trials one man has to endure to be attain the proverbial redemption of the title.  Maybe it is because this movie is truth, simple truth, about the triumph of good over evil, the triumph of reason over madness, the triumph of hope over everything.",8

The movie deserve Oscar for all the category but sadly it didn't get even it is the best movie of the century, but it wins ppl heart anyway that is more than Oscar.",9
"I must say that this is the best prison films of all time. I couldn't believe that this film didn't win any Academy Awards. This film could have win at least one or two. Also, I thought that Tim Robbins could have earned an Oscar nomination. He gave a superb performance. But the one who was powerful in this film is Morgan Freeman. He gave one of the best performances that I have ever seen in film. It was heartwrenching. I like that tagline: Fear can make you prisoner, Hope can set you free. Frank Darabont did superb filmmaking in this film. By the way, I found out that Allen Greene, the person that Frank dedicated at the end, was the director's agent and his close personal friend. If you want to see a film that takes place in a prison or dramatic films, then see this film. You will never regret it. It is the best prison film since Midnight Express. SEE IT!",10
"I'd say this is the movie that got me into movies. It got me into more of my favorite movies such as Taxi Driver, Inception, Pulp Fiction, and so many other great movies. Morgan Freeman has to be my favorite actor in it, not to undermine Tim Robbins whose performance was compelling and beautiful. It does a great job of humanizing criminals and it has one of my favorite antagonists in any movie ever, except maybe the Joker in the Dark Knight or Candie from Django Unchained.",10
"Twenty years for freedom and hope. ""Shawshank redemption"" spiritual level of hard core, deep meaning and influence. A man's thirst for freedom is powerful. He can make a man chisel away at a wall. The good and evil in people's hearts are not increased or decreased by the loss of time or the change of environment.",10
Never met anyone who doesn't like this film and that's just testament to how good it really is,10
"First of all, this is a marvelous, uplifting film with wonderful performances from Robbins and Freeman, a superlative score from Newman, is by far the best King adaptation (although that's not saying a whole lot) and has many terrific and emotional scenes, but get real folks. This is not the best film of all time - not even close. It's not even the best of 1994 ('Pulp Fiction' gets my nod), let alone the best prison flick (I'll take 'Cool Hand Luke' thank you and, if you include POW films, 'The Bridge Over the River Kwai' and 'The Great Escape' are both much better). Just think folks. Better than 'Citizen Kane,' 'Casablanca,' 'Gone with the Wind,' 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Schindler's List' (which also could be considered in the prison category by the way)!? I'm not criticizing this movie - just the lack of perspective. It's definitely in the top 10 of the decade and probably in cine history's top 5%. That should be enough.",8
"I cannot deny two things:
1. Stephen King is the master of horror / suspense2. If the crowd decides to like something, no matter what it is, there no way no one can stop it.If you are irritated by the amount of votes of ""Shawshank redemption,"" perhaps you will find Akira Kurosawa´s ""Runaway train"" not so cliché prison film.",9
"Brooks is a heavy and sad piece in the movie. He was imprisoned for 50 years. As Red said, this long age completely institutionalized him, so when he was free again, he was at a loss. The old man stumbled out of prison for 50 years, enough to make a drastic change in the outside world. He was unfamiliar and panicked, but could no longer find his place, and eventually chose to end his life in advance.",9
"This is one of the Best movie i have seen in my life till date! It actually shows you how to live a goddamn life. There are many messages lying in this film and the best 2 are known to you all. It actually showed me that life is not what we think it is! Its about going down Hundred times and getting back Thousand times! Life is always should be considered as Fighting with the Storm(sometimes it may be Tornado!). But once the storm is over, you won't remember how you made it through, or how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, whether the storm is really over or not. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in! That's what this storm's all about! It makes you totally a different person! So always Keep your Hope constant and Get Busy Living the Goddamn Life on your own! :)",6
"It really is difficult to find anything at all negative to write about this absolute cinema classic. If there is just one point that comes to mind perhaps it would be the apparent lack of visitors to see the inmates, though it might well be argued they would probably add little to this near perfect story. There, at least I have thought of something!!
This movie dominates the mind in a way few others have ever achieved. The storyline unwinds in brilliant fashion, the playing by all the cast is beyond reproach, with Oscar-worthy performances throughout.
I can think of no other film that tells the penal servitude story the way this does, and frankly can only finish by pleading to everyone that they really must see this monumental movie at least once in their lives. Magnificent.",10
"I was told for years that this was a great movie. I always had thoughts about watching it. But then I saw Green Mile. I always credited them in the same category before watching them. Green Mile was okay and all, but it did not exceed my expectations. I did not have high hopes for this movie. Then I saw it.I was enthralled from the minute that Andy unwrapped the gun in his car. But then again, thats just me. The real action begins the minute Andy steps off the bus. The minute Hadley picks his first victim. And then it picks up the minute Andy gets his friends a couple beers each.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I can see why it ranks number one over all. The revenge scene near the end is awesome. Never mess with Andy Dufrense. Watch this movie any way you can.",10
"It's the most overrated movie of my life,not even one of the, it's ""the"".it has some good actors and dialogues and that's all this movie has to offer, its utterly boring,too long for such a stupid story, it deserves no more than 6* at all by no means.i have stopped taking movie recommendations from everyone who suggested me this movie",9
"Freeman's character is more compelling, giving him a natural grace and dignity. It's a really good movie",10
"i dont know what to see about this movie that hasn't already been said. as good as movie as forrest gump was, the only major award it should have won over shawshank was tom hanks as best actor. an argument can be made for zemeckis for director, but seeing as shawshank redemption is such a better movie, and most of the movie takes place in location, (shawshank prison) i think darabont is robbed not only for not winning the oscar, but not even scoring a nomination. and seeing as he would be the best director, i would think that if you're directed your film best it would logically be the best picture. tim robbins is also robbed of a nomination, and i think hanks just edges him for that trophy. the biggest travesty of all is that shawshank doesn't even win any of the oscars it was nominated for. if you havent seen this film recently, go pop it in the dvd or vcr and just sit back and revel in its magnificence.",7
"Wonderful acting, good writing and a fantastic story provide for a classic that has kept up surprisingly well throughout the ages.Well worth a watch even despite being an older movie.",5
"Loved the movie, watched it several times now and always see something new. Great human conflicts. Clever plot. Acting was superior. Catch myself thinking what it must be like to be in a prison every time I watch it. Could not do it. The movie draws you in and you can't help feeling like you a part of it. The interaction of the characters had so many levels of emotions tied to them. Can't imagine what people must feel when they are innocent and end up in prison Horrifying thought on so many levels. The ending was great, but I wanted to see more. wanted to know what their future was like. wanted to see it. I love the fact that the movie actually brought you to the reunion of the two main characters and how it played out.",9
"Morgan Freeman is fantastic in this film as he guides Tim Robbins through his 20+ years at Shawshank Prison. This movie takes you through many different emotions. Everything that takes place in the prison makes me definitely not want to ever go to prison! Tim Robbins gives a superb performance as Andy Dufrense an innocent man sent to a very vengeful prison. If you have never seen this film, you will be amazed by everything that happens. Great ending by the way.The warden played by Bob Gunton is the perfect 2-faced bible-toting, under the counter dealing bad-guy in a position of power over others. Somehow this movie summed up life over the last fifty or so years looking back on who was in power running the country and big business.",9
"Based on the Stephen King novella ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Of the many Stephen King stories that were made into movies, this is the truest adaptation. It was nominated and should have won best picture in 1993. The movie was cast perfectly with outstanding performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Clancy Brown.",9
"THE MOVIE IS GOOD BUT NOT UNIQUE. YOU CAN FIND A LOT OF THIS KIND. ITS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO PERFECTION LIKE THE GOOD,THE BAD AND THE UNGLY.",8
"This movie was the perfect example of those who have patience, and the will to move forward, and fight for what you believe in shall always prevail. Maybe not right then when you want it but it shall happen. Regardless of the plot he went and did what he had to and never once lost his wits and his will. The actors were amazing and one of my favorites in Morgan freeman once again did his thing in capturing the character, and just drawing you into the movie itself. It's Amazing how things from back then, still somewhat hasn't changed in this time era. Maybe someday our judicial system will change for the better who knows. Yet for right now we do with what we have and hope and pray it changes for the better. Awesome awesome movie that I have seen countless times.",10
Wow Its the best criminal prison drama movie I have ever seen,10
"Hope is a good thing probably best of all & good thing never dies ."" This line from this movie shows the actual truth what humanity need most . "" The Shawshank redemption "" is based upon legendary stephen king's novel which represents very truth of life never lose hope because it probably best of all . Great direction by frank darabondt , impeccable script , screenplay , towering performances by cast made this movie greatest movie ever made . Duffrian's relentless effort to get away from prison life stands him alone from others , life in prison is totally different one just have to confront his /her fear trauma , one has to tackle with them else life will be nothing less than hell , also keep your mind busy as mind itself can be most troubled thing in prison life if it remained unattended . Casting is another great thing about this movie , characters of Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman have been crafted by director so perfectly that they have become great source of inspiration for all. I personally belive this movie is life learning lesson , everyone must need to watch this movie and understand how difficult traumatic life could be ,one of the the scene where one of the inmate committed suicide when he was released from prison and allowed to live a common man life as it was tough for him to adjust with society like he has become accustomed to prison life , that harrowing reality will shock you how traumatic life could be . This great movie is absolutely an evershing gem of world cinema . Don't miss this great movie it's a life time experience of a kind you won't ever forget.",7
"The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an educated banker sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, Andy inspires his fellow inmates with his courage and humanity and has a profound effect on Red (Morgan Freeman), an older prisoner, who has given up hope.Unlike many films of the 90's, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has ""high concept"" plot premise and is somewhat episodic compared with the tight, linear narratives of closer structured pictures. This sense of freedom in the storytelling allows the film to consistently throw up genuine surprises, as the viewer isn't constantly on guard for clues and plot points. In hindsight, we tend to forget how successfully director Frank Darabont leads us to expect a very different resolution.""The Shawshank Redemption"" does things well that you might not expect. It has lengthy voice-overs (that actually work well) and it has a sappy predictable ending, but yet these elements work because they are not placed in the over-used, meaningless context that movies today place them in. The voice overs are also consistently used in such a way that distinct worlds are created. There's a real world inside the prison and the surreal outside world.These two distinct worlds are created help to place the viewer inside the halls of the prison, they are no longer watching a movie, but they are also feeling it.This is a movie that will remain a favorite of the people for many decades to come. 10/10",10
"I have seen this movie several times, and have noticed things I hadn't noticed on previous viewings. This is the story of a man convicted of killing his wife. I hate spoilers, so won't list anything, you just need to see this movie. I did have a couple of issues with things that happen in the movie which is why its only 8 stars/",10
This is a sad film. Its extremely good but its also black in the way that a brick wall in front of a motorway is dangerous. Until the last two minutes its an unrelenting depression. Bang! its sad (the sound of its dark feelings hitting my head.) I can't say anything about this movie. Its beyond good. It is FAULTLESS. Watch it! Then you try an review it.,9
"I have no idea, why this movie has received such a good rating. It´s an average prison movie without any highlights. Typical Hollywood stuff. There are hundreds of better movies around. The movie drags, the actors are average. It´s just this typical ""heartbreaking"" stuff and far away from other movies up on this list.",8
A film like this comes along every few decades. Its better than savage or amazing the only way to describe it is the greatest film EVER. Its all about a man called Andy Dufresne falsely accused of murder of his wife and her lover and is sent to shawshank prison where he is beaten by the guards and other prisoners. Eventually he makes a friend called Red and fits in with Red. Andy was a smart banker before prison and used his brains to help the other prisoners like solving the guards tax problems then the wardens. Andy finds a way to escape from the prison by digging a hole and using a poster of Rita Hayworth to cover the hole(That is why the short story is called Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption) Andy escapes but before escaping he told Red to look under a tree when he leaves. Red leaves and finds that Andy under a fake name living in Mexico. The two meet for the first time in years and shake hands. The Shawshank Redemption starts and ends Fascinating.,8
"It is the best movie i have ever seen.Watched it 5 years back and was mesmerized. Just can't stop myself watching it again and again whenever it airs on TV or get a chance to recommend it to someone. Usually i don't like the movies based on this theme. i just watched it as it appeared on the top and believe me it blew my mind as i finished watching it. The storytelling, screenplay, direction everything is just awesome and cannot be better. I have seen most of the IMDb's top movies. some remain on top some loose, but this one can't be dethroned. As I am watching this for 10th time(which i usually don't do, and neither do I write reviews :)), it came in my mind to give this masterpiece a tribute by posting the review. If you haven't seen it, go watch it as soon as possible. you will remember the masterpiece for years.",10
"As someone who loves great movies, I must say this is my first review only because this film deserves every accolade it has received and will receive throughout the years....it is a rare priceless gem, a shining example of film perfection...I don't think I will ever see such a great film ever again in my lifetime. Everything comes together flawlessly in the movie, the actors, the plot, the direction, the cinematography, all of it producing a film for the ages....if Stephen King never writes another word, he and director Frank Darabont have given the world an amazing gift in this film...A sincere thank you just doesn't seem enough but you have my undying gratitude for this movie.",10
"This may be decades behind. But after watching this for the 159th time on a censored station, is this the greatest movie ever, period, as well as the one movie you beg for just 5 more minutes of screen. The fade out from the oceanside was perfect. Yet Frank. Just show them playing chess on the boat. Not sure bout all the pieces. Who cares. We would cry with every chess move and surely every drink to freedom. But sure that's what happened anyway.",10
"Amazing film.
It is a poiganant story about hope and friend .
How friend looks like and what hope will let you to do.
Belive me you will see this film more than one and each time you will say amazing,grest film.",10
"I am surprised at how many people have not seen this movie. It's spectacular. I have two favorite movies. This is one of them. I have friends who have no interest in seeing Shawshank, but after I make them watch it, they all love it. No exceptions. I can't believe Forrest Gump won best picture in '94. The Oscars lick.",10
"I have watched this in my Teens, twenties, Thirties and this evening recently turned 47.I watched it alone, while my family, healthy and happy pottering around.As Someone who can't keep still I was anchored totally for its duration, like never before. And for the first time in my life, I felt like Andy, free, lucky and happy.I don't have a boat, but while glancing up from the End Credits, I see my family pottering away, still. I have a feeling of being truly happy and content.There's times in the all our lives we feel a little involuntarily confined.This movie is amazing, for the way I feel after watching it this evening, it's my favourite film of all time.Enjoy.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994/Frank Darabont) **** out of ****""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up DOES rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.""- Red (Morgan Freeman)This is the ultimate story of friendship. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young hot-shot banker who is railroaded for a double murder in 1947. He is then sent to Shawshank Prison, where he soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man 'who can get things'. The movie spans almost 20 years, and shows the growing friendship of these two men. Joining them is the old pro James Whitmore as Brooks, who does a great job as a man who ""lives in fear"". This is the best ""feel good"" movie of all time, and one of the best of the 90's. It is flawless in a departments. It is based on a short story by Stephen King, and is masterfully put onto the big screen. Freeman turns in his best performance, and has many great lines as the stories narrator. In fact, the film is well written and projects deep meanings of triumph and hope. Many critics have complained that the film is too long. Whomever truly believes this can not call themselves a film critic. The film is slowly paced to show the long growing friendship of Andy and Red. It's pacing is what makes it so real and excellent.SPOILERS: The ending is the best part of the film, and has probably the best scene in motion picture history: Andy's Escape. The film's music plays a big part in this scene, showing Andy's determination and endurance. You end up rooting for him all the way. Another great scene is when Andy talks to Red after he gets out of the ""hole"". Red reveals his weaknesses and fears, but Andy has hope.This film is a masterpiece of story telling, and should not be missed. Like I said in the beginning of the review, not only is the film flawless in all departments, it excels in every way. You will believe in hope.-30-",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a redemption story in which the main character committed no crime of which to be redeemed. Although the hopeful message resonates with audiences, The Shawshank Redemption is not the greatest movie ever made: Every character is a stereotype, the cinematography is bland, and the pace is slow.",10
"This film makes you feel like you ok spend 20 years with these characters, in a good way. I felt a real connection to each character. Every actor had a great performance. It's not perfect but it is really good.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a classically quiet film about the injustice served to one man and his consequent adaptive actions. Frank Darabont has shown true talent in the creation of this near-perfect modest film with most scenes showcasing deliberate quaint beauty. Emphasising the beauty of life through many mediums, some ethical, some not, this film really helps the viewer appreciate life and the little things. With a cast performing their roles perfectly, this uplifting and high-spirited film is a stand alone about every simple aspect of life and how it is approached. The Shawshank Redemption is a deserved classic.",10
"I've been thinking why is this movie The best movie for so many people, then I remembered it is like music, the best music is the ones you heard at 14. because you associate with memory and when your brain starts developing and your awareness of yourself and others come into being.this movie revitalized my love for classical and baroque music no doubt and introduced some themes. I find the main character somewhat unrealistic only because I personally cannot relate to him. If I was in his position I doubt I would have done what he did.It is good but I prefer Morgan Freeman's The Bucket List much more and a variety of prison movies(American History X) and TV series(Prison Break).",9
"The deepest feeling after the film is: talent, perseverance, is anyone in any situation to get free the best way.",10
"Fear makes you a prisoner, hoping to set you free. -""Shawshank redemption""",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is unbelievably well executed. It is filled with emotion, a gripping storyline, and likable (and unlikable) characters. The ending may bring you to tears. Everyone should watch this film to remind themselves of what a movie should aspire to be.",10
"This is the best movie I've ever watched!! It told a moving story very effectively. Former banker Andy Dusfresne is wrongly convicted for a double murder and sent to Shawshank Prison. The first few years are a struggle but he eventually carves out for a place for himself and benefits the other inmates in the process, winning favours through helping the guards and warden with financial planning and expanding the prison's meagre library. He becomes solid friends with Red, a black man who entered 20 years before and is highly resourceful. What resonates with the audience is Andy's clinging to hope. The saddest part was when the boy that Andy had been tutoring obtained a high school diploma, but shortly after, was shot dead under the warden's orders as he had knowledge that could prove Andy innocent. Following that, Red tells Andy that hope is a dangerous thing. Bur further events prove that hope is in fact a good thing (as Andy tells Red in a letter) - Andy escapes through a hole he dug in his cell wall (hidden behind a large poster of a hot woman) and escapes to Mexico using a false identity and cash that he'd procured while laundering money for the warden. Before leaving, he submits evidence incriminating the hypocritical warden. As the cross-stitching on the warden's office wall reads, judgment does indeed come! Red is released soon after and struggles to adapt to the outside the world. But for Andy's invitation to join him, Red would probably have gone down the path of Brooks, who committed suicide.The Shawshank Redemption combined a message of hope with wonderful storytelling and attention to detail. It's truly a masterpiece.",10
"You have to live this movie
I didn't know it after watching it 10 times but finely I got the feeling
Some masterpieces should be watched listened and read for 10000 times until they'd be comprehended completely
Long night of prison
You'll never get out
No hope
No fairytale
But there might be redemption",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is considered one of the greatest films of the 90. The story talks about hope, the story of director (Frank Darabont) and the act of (Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman).
The story is about( Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. )",10
"OH MY GOD!, this was so heartbreaking to watch, almost in tears... I loved this film with my soul, and every second of it was super worth it. This is just a 10/10, once more proud of saying Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors ever! And this movie is by far the best.",9
"Yes, Utter perfection on celluloid.Must see for anyone.",10
"I have seen this film over 25 times, it's the best film ever made. There is nothing bad about tit. Look forward to watching it another 25 times. Thank you frank darabont and everybody else that was a part of this absolute masterpiece. We should have a shawshank redemption day!!",10
"As a person who loves watching movies of different categories and genres, I could say that this movie could truly represent our planet earth in a right way to aliens (If they exist). With this, I would like to underline that this is a film that shows our humanity and the fact that a person could have patience of the highest level.
I would recommend to everyone to watch this amazing masterpiece, even if you are not a cinema lover or as interested in cinematography as I am.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is hands down the best movie of all time. I will type that again, Shawshank Redemption is the best movie.....EVER. Everything about this movie is amazing. This is Tim Robbins best work, Morgan Freeman is perfect as Red in every frame of the film and everybody else is great in their roles. Every time I see this film I love it just a little bit more and it still stands as one of the best examples of hope ever to be put on film. It also has one of the lines in film history, which I have quoted often in my life, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" So overall, a total Masterpiece. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5PyYKla1G8",8
"Certainly not a masterpiece. Lacks in many areas.
I can't count this movie even in my top 20 chart.
The Shawshank Redemption and ""The Big Lebowski"" are the most
overated movies in my opinion.",10
"Where I'm I going to start , well this magnificent work of art directed by the big Frank Darabont and co-writing bu the legendary Stephen king and started by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was just as perfect as it allows it to lead the 250 top IMDb table, yeah ,it had everything from directing ,writing and acting until good soundtracks and cinematography ,not to mention the unforeseen twisted ending which had me blocked for what it remained from the film . the shawshank redemption was overtaken in the 95th for the benefit of Forrest Gump who was truly a masterpiece and Pulp fiction who was also out of this world but still the shawshank deserved more at least for me ,I mean it is one of few who could led me into this state of admiration and worship even and for that it's and it will always be my all time favorite film .",9
"Shawshank redemption is a epic movie in the history of cinema. It can be watched infinite times. The friendship,hopes of redemption is put together nicely. The background are stunning. The places in the film are exceptionally marvelous which takes you to another world.No other film in the world has this much message. It should have won more than 7 oscars. hypocrisy of Oscar
Ultimately the best movie.",7
"In my subjective opinion, Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best movie and my personal favorite... But this movie, this movie is just soooo good... While it is not my favorite movie, it deserves the title of ""Best movie of all time""...It's never Boring, the characters are fun and relatable, and the motivations are just AMAZING!This movie is worth a watch, any time",10
"There are a lot of movies that tell us something important. But this movie is different from those. If we put all movies on one line,this one can't be put on it. We all should see this movie at least once in our lives.",10
"Oh man where to begin. This movie has it all. Easy to follow for both critics and normal viewers alike. This film has it all. The performances are amazing, especially Morgan Freeman. For God Sake he even narrates it. This film deserves the top spot on IMDb for sure. The story is great, and it really gives a great look at what prison can be like and how it can affect a man. It also has one of the most satisfying endings in film history. Stephen King may be a creepy guy but boy does his books make incredible movies. I recommend this movie to literally everyone (except small children) who are looking for an emotional, heart-warming, tear-jerking, amazingly created movie.",10
I rather enjoy the green mile but this is an amazing piece of classic cinema which I dont know why people hated on when it came out in '94 but morgan freeman was amazing,8
"This film is honestly phenomenal, after finishing this film I was honestly so impressed, I had the highest expectations for this film and they were completely exceeded. The writing in this film is exceptional, I appreciated the realism of this film, it didn't jump around the idea of prison and its harsh reality. As well as this, the approach this film took, 'Red' (Morgan Freeman), being the narrator, allows the audience to experience the storyline even more, due to Red not being able to see everything, and more of an observer. The characters of this film were excellent and made me emotionally attached to all of them, this film explored the effects of prison on a person's mental health and personality. Additionally 'The Shawshank Redemption' comments on the justice system in place in modern society, showing the audience that it can only do so much with the evidence provided and the defendant's budget for a lawyer, as a result sometimes making the wrong person to go to jail.The pacing of this film allows the audience to feel the monotony, the time served, and the painful countdown to their release. The cyclical structure used in this film, through Red's probation release interviews, is effective in showing change, presenting people to be able to change and completely transform into a new person. This film teaches lessons of allowing mistakes, showing it's not about preventing mistakes, it's about what a person does to learn from those mistakes, to improve themselves for the future. Furthermore this film teaches to embrace wherever life takes you, to make do with what you have, and to make solutions rather than problems. The story is misleading and constantly keeps the audience invested, all of the intricate details of the story that seem out of place are then revealed in the ending of the film in spectacular fashion, for example the posters (to me) seemed out of character for Dufresne, however this was excused as being in prison for 2 life sentences will inevitably lead to a form of depression at some point, so it became less suspicious. The ending to this film gave me goosebumps and it was an absoulutely amazing conclusion to this story, it created a pure form of escapism for me being so happy that justice was served and the characters, presumably, lived happily ever after, knowing all of the pain, time and work was all worth brought me happiness. The very last shot of the film being significant, a representation of their story being one of many, them being so small by the end of the shot, as well as the audience leaving them to live their lives in complete bliss.",9
"Well, more than two thousands comments and mostly positive why I need to write the comment for the simple reason I wants to pay a small homage to movie making and proving to the world that still every now and then Hollywood still come-up with rare gems. I watched this movie so many times and every time I sit through this movie from start to end which is quite rare these days to stick to a movie for more than 2 hours without feeling the patches of boredom or feeling the movie being bit long. I am still not sure what happen to Oscar which don't give best actor award to Morgan Freeman or best supporting actor award to Tim Robbins, well its really unfortunate. There is a saying about great movies, that great movies just made themselves and that's about it, you cant just make them again and again and among several of those great movies this movies will always stands. Frank Darabont will always be remember for his two outstanding work one is The Shawshank Redemption and another The Green Mile.",9
"Well-acted, well-directed, powerful and thought-provoking, The Shawshank Redemption encompasses all of the above, as it tells the incredibly inspiring story of friendship and hope. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine in their roles as inmates who develop a remarkable bond during their imprisonment, facing the struggles of prison life together and ultimately finding redemption. Although it focuses on a very familiar theme, The Shawshank Redemption stands out from the rest of the films in its genre, mainly due to the extremely intimate portrayal of its characters it has to offer. The film successfully uses its prison setting as a lens for society, and manages to present the audience with important life lessons throughout the storyline. Although not designed as a film of epic proportions, its nature does have an immense emotional impact on the viewer, which makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time.",7
"There's a reason why this is No 1 in IMDB Why it has taken me so long to see this film is a mystery with people saying ""How have you not seen The Shawshank Redemption"" I always thought it was just another film inside a prison so nothing special but after watching it I hold my hands up and admit I should have seen this sooner.The relationships that are built come close to even unbreakable especially between Andy and Red. The writing is well thought and it shows through the script.
The desire of control over inmates from Warden Norton to is nothing short of incredible.I have seen a lot of websites based on The Shawshank Redemption VS The Green Mile over which one will hit you hardest emotionally. But as hard to believe with The Green Mile was when making Michael Clarke Duncan a man with a child's mind and how well the director making it show as well as the writers. But how as much as this is seen as a to be a cornerstone as a drama class of film and how well it is also seen as at is easy to see why this film is a classic and in some people's mind is the better of the two. However as incredibly emotional this film is as a drama and how hard this film will hit you and will leave you heartbroken and emotionally scarred, The Shawshank takes the lead. admittedly not by a huge margin but not a close call either.Films based in prisons aren't not exactly my first choice of film and even then the ones I had seen before this minus The Green Mile are ones with over the top and unneeded sexism and are filmed to be aimed at teenagers. Shawshank is aimed to convey both minor and clear messages about a friendship between people either best friends or otherwise. Overall to call this film an absolute classic in all of films and one of the best films to watch doesn't quite give this film justice as to how good it actually is. In my opinion this isn't a film that you may need to see, this a film that you have to see.",9
"I will start my review off by saying that this film is very slow to start off. I'd say the first 30-45 minutes of it are very slow, and almost boring. BUT, that is about the only negative things I can say about this film. From that point on it is an absolute thrill ride. I would sit behind my computer and say to myself, ""Next scene I'll turn it off. Next scene I'll go do something."" And I never did. Something just kept me there, needing and prying to find out what would happen in the next second, and the one after that, and the one after that. The film seems to be building up exponentially to the ending climax, which delivers in phenomenal fashion. Not often do I get emotional about films, but this one almost did it. Absolute must see for anyone looking for a feel good film.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption doesn't deserve 10.. it goes beyond all ratings.. such movies come once in a lifetime.. and I can say, undoubtedly, that this is the best movie I've watched so far .. across all languages!! Makes u go deep down into ur soul.. makes u realize the true meaning of freedom.. makes u realize the importance of being hopeful!! It's 2019 and I'm definitely late in watching this movie.. but better late than never!! Truly beautiful..",9
"One of those movies that always seems to be on some channel and I always end up watching it. A movie almost entirely comprised of men enduring prison and corruption and surviving rape and attempted murder offers something surprising, hope.",10
"a very great one, with so many moments burned forever in my memory... this is a movie about hope and about staying yourself, even under such circumstances it perfectly mixes the best use of a narrator voice i have watched so far with beautiful and still very honest pictures and great dialogs, telling the story of a man thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit. despite all the pain he meets there, all the hopelessness those high gray walls suggest he manages to preserve his hope and humanity, even to do something good for the people around him. i couldn't imagine a better cast for it, especially liked Clancy Brown as a nasty, sadistic Captain, but all were great. this is one of the few movies i know being better than the books they are based on - in this case it's not that difficult in fact, with the novel being rather mediocre and a bit boring somehow. and for sure this is the best movie based on a Stephen King novel. watch it and tell me it could not touch you Andy Dufresne: (in letter to Red) ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""a very great one, with so many moments burned forever in my memory...this is a movie about hope and about staying yourself, even under such circumstancesit perfectly mixes the best use of a narrator voice i have watched so far with beautiful and still very honest pictures and great dialogs, telling the story of a man thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit. despite all the pain he meets there, all the hopelessness those high gray walls suggest he manages to preserve his hope and humanity, even to do something good for the people around him.i couldn't imagine a better cast for it, especially liked Clancy Brown as a nasty, sadistic Captain, but all were great.this is one of the few movies i know being better than the books they are based on - in this case it's not that difficult in fact, with the novel being rather mediocre and a bit boring somehow. and for sure this is the best movie based on a Stephen King novel.watch it and tell me it could not touch youAndy Dufresne: (in letter to Red) ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is nearly poetic, but misses slightly because of its straight-forward telling.  That isn't a flaw really.  It's just that considering some of the powerful human emotions and grandiose spritual scenes displayed, the film could have been legendary.  Still, this film is destined to be a classic and rightfully so.  Stephen King hasn't written another story that was better (Title ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" in the book ""Diffrent Seasons"" which also contains ""The Body"" which was made into another great movie, ""Stand By Me"" starring River Phoenix).  Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman are outstanding.  Drama rarely gets muchs better than this and the solitude of human existence is depressingly displayed here.  Wonderful, wonderful!Oh yeah, Morgan Freeman's explanation for being named ""Red"" is probably one of the purely humorous things you'll ever hear.",10
"This film appeals to anyone, thats why its #2 on IMDB. This film for some reason made only 28 million at the box-office. I love Forrest Gump I really do, but this is the best picture if the year. It has some sorta quality that is rare in films that instead of pulling you away, it draws you closer. The 30th time you watch this film, you will still be drawn in closer. The film is magical. Don't ever forget that.",10
"There is a sentence in Shawshank's redemption:""Don't forget,this world penetrates all high walls,it is deep in our hearts,that is hope.""There is no endless winter and no spring that cannot come.",10
"The movie is just excellent, I really liked the plot of the movie and Akshay Kumar's acting. I'm sure it will be a success, the sensational movie. Super Top!! I recommend!!",10
"This film is truly magnificent and if there is anyone out there who hasn't seen it they should get straight down to their local video shop and buy it because it is the sort of film that you will want to watch over and over again.  There is no acting in any other film that comes close to Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman.  I fail to see how anyone could fault any part of this film it is, in my opinion, perfect.  The plot line is great and there is no way you could guess what is coming next and the ending is completely unpredictable.",9
"I did not think this was a bad film I just think it's a bit overrated but everyone has there own opinion and that's fine. I thought the writing was amazing and it had some genuinely good shots and it was also very moving. This compared to Stephen kings other adaptations Stand By Me, The Shinning, Christine it just wasn't as good as those at least in my opinion. But I did like it and I do recommend it seeing as it's kinda a must watch for film lovers like myself.",10
"Small failures can't stop this movie from being grand, moving and very well made. In it's first, and elegants scenes, we see Andy Dufresne finding his wife and her lover dead, and then Andy being falsely Accused of murder and sentenced to prison. This first scenes although great, are not very important to the movie, because the movie does not turns around Andy's false accusation (We know that since the beginning), it's about what he learns and teaches inside the prison. Although Robbins's performance is not excellent, he gives the character an air of sadness, and in almost every scene of the picture, we can see through his expressions that he is always either angry because he is not supposed to be there, or upset because he can't find a way out of there. Despite the fact that this movie is not very original, and when I say that I'm remembering that it took a lot of elements from Don Siegel's ""Scape from Alcatraz"" (I mean, it can be coincidence, but don't you think that Brooks's raven is very is very similar in the story to the mouse of ""Scape from Alcatraz?), the movie covers it because it's always grabbing you on the screen , I mean, there wasn't a single moment in the whole movie that I thought was boring.Verdict: With a powerful moving story, charismatic characters (Especially Freeman's), this Excellent movie is a great study of agony and friendship.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is another Stephen King book based movie made my Frank Darabont. I have said earlier that when Darabont makes a movie based on a Stephen King book, it simply results in magic on screen, and The Shawshank Redemption is almost a perfect example of that. Despite receiving very positive reviews from critics, developing a cult following, this film failed to well at the Box Office and barely managed to recover it's costs.It's a shame really because this film deserves better, it is one of the best films of the 90s and an excellent film, with a very deep and engaging plot. Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on Prison Life and follows the life of two prisoners who become close friends. Darabont also made another movie based on Prison Life, The Green Mile, also based on a Stephen King book. However the former is a more realistic portrayal of prison life, it shows the harsh life of prisons even back in the 1940s-60s and the hostile environment, prison life is portrayed more accurately.The Plot is simply fantastic, after first 5 minutes I was just hooked, and the plot is the main reason I kept on re-watching this movie, however I did find myself struggling on the 4th viewing because the movie really starts to drag a lot at several points, and if you have watched those slow progressing scenes before they will be hard to sit through again. The movie does not try to completely serious at times, it also has it's amusing moments and some nice heart warming moments, the ending was also well done, although a dialogue exchange between Red and Dufaine would have been nice.However the plot is not really perfect, there are several unexplained things in the movie, how did Andy manage to frame the Warden or Hadley for Tommy's murder, and wouldn't revealing the Warden's illegal earnings also get Andy (who pretends to be Randall Stephens)in trouble. Also the supposed twist, that Andy didn't do it seemed unnecessary because it went nowhere, if Andy had in fact committed the murder and got his redemption, it would have added to the plot in my personal opinion. I am not going to criticize King's idea or the writers' ideas behind the story but I felt like the twist of of psychotic murderer was unnecessary. Also the films progresses years really fast, at least showing you the year on a blank screen would have cleared the confusion because even in my 4th viewing I was confused at several points, that which year it actually was, Freeman's narrating was helpful but it still lead to confusion about which year it actually is.The acting is also good, Morgan Freeman steals the show with his performance Red ""Ellis Redding"", he also narrates many parts of the film and does it excellently. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown act so well and really make you despise them. Even Adam Sandler plays the cool laid back prisoner very well. However Tim Robbin's is decent at best as Andy Dufaine, it is understandable he was a depressed character but his smirk, blank and confused facial expressions throughout the film are just tiresome, he really seems robotic, there are actors who could have done better honestly, nothing against Robbins, he can act well no doubt, he did good in Jacob's Ladder but here he doesn't stand out, not saying he is bad at all but his performance could have been better, as he was the lead it would have added more to the film. The music is nice it fits the movie and many scenes very well. And the direction is also done very well, the portrayal of prison life is very accurate and realistic. The film's message about hope and friendship is also mesmerizing.The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated gem, an excellent film with an in-depth that deserved much more acclaim and commercial success at its time of release. However it is not perfect, has it's share of mistakes and is simply not the greatest movie ever made as IMDb top 250 lists it.Overall: 9/10",10
"Shawshank Redemption is truly an inspirational film--a work of art. What makes this film so special (asside from the excellent acting from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) is the message of hope, even in your darkest hours. Robbins plays a man sent to jail for a crime he did not commit--the murder of his wife and her lover. He is found guilty, and sent to Shawshank Penitentiary. He meets Freeman, who has spent most of his life in Shawshank for a crime he committed when he was a young, dumb kid. Freeman feels that Robbins wouldn't last past his first night in prison. But after being repeatedly sodomized by ""the sisters"" and manipulated by the warden, Robbins remains resilient and hopeful. He gains Freeman's respect as well as his friendship. The men go through three decades of unhappiness as the pinup on Robbin's wall changes from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Racquel Welsch. Each one hiding a secret that grows bigger, with time. Something that Robbins doesn't even confide in his best friend Freeman.After one final betrayal from the warden, we find out what those posters were hiding...The gateway to Robbins' freedom. I'll spoil no more for you...but recommend you watch this film yourself. It's quite inspiring and uplifting.9/10",9
"I was wondered while seeing the top rated imdb movies list that what is so special about this movie which makes it stand at the top #1 rated movie,but after watching it I will definitely say that this movie has each and every right to be in no.1 spot what a pure classic cult film,the best it's a guide to the the entire society and ppl hatts of to the whole team.!!!!!",10
"Rather than just enjoy movies, critics like to play ""The Greatest Film"" game.  A few years back, it was rare that a contemporary film was picked as greatest.  ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Le Grand Illusion,"" ""The Gold Rush"" and other pre-1950 films usually got the nod well into the 1980's.Then, for some reason, most likely the Internet opening up a voice for the average person to rate film, contemporary films started getting in. ""Schindler's List"" was one that comes to mind.  ""Shawshank Redemption"" is another.While picking the same old, stale films year after year doesn't seem to be logical, picking newer ones has a certain risk.  Many films amaze and beguile audiences when they come out because they are geared to what currently sells.  As years passed, the flaws become apparent and they drop out of sight, while timeless films initially received lukewarmly, or even critically, such as ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""The General,"" or ""Intolerance"" soar.  Will ""The Shawshank Redemption"" drop into obscurity, too?  I don't think so. Why?  One can try to explain.Two possible reasons are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  I don't know if either are underrated actors or not, but I rarely hear people remark how completely they transform themselves from role to role.  This is certainly the case here. The two performances, and the chemistry between the two men is the core of the film and reinforces one of its primary messages: never let anyone make you lose hope.  The fact the setting, prison, is alien to most filmgoer's experience, doesn't matter.  ""Shawshank"" could never be considered a ""prison"" film.  It contains a story as archetypal as ""The Odyssey,"" a long journey, through many dangers, that ends with the traveler (this time, two travelers) seen to a safe shore (literally!).Another great strength of ""Shawshank"" is how it operates on different levels.  Like Jon Avnet's ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" it has its most obvious message--about not losing hope and surviving--set highest.  But as ""Tomatoes"" had a gay subtext that could be acknowledged or ignored, so does ""Shawshank,"" that prison is a dehumanizing experience that ends up ruining people for life rather than just letting them pay their debts to society and move on.Given this country's conservative bent, it is somewhat bizarre that a film that carries this message is so adored.  All I can say is the other aspects of the film allow one to ignore it and still enjoy it, which is probably fitting since films where the message is the most important thing, such as those of the '50's and '60's, now show their age badly. 
In the final analysis, though, regardless of what elements we pick at, we ultimately can't say why ""Shawshank"" is so great.  We just know it is by how we feel and how others feel.Two final examples of the latter.    The moment in Andy's escape when he stands in the sewage lagoon outside the prison and holds his arms up in jubilation as the rain pours on him is always a part of trailers and coming attractions.  Indeed it was part one of the film's original ads.  Why should the filmmakers give away the ending?  Because there is nothing to give away.  One can see the film 100 times knowing Andy will escape and still want to see it, because it isn't about an escape plot.  It's about Andy and Red's journey and what they teach each other.The second example is that the Lifetime Channel, which generally shows either classic ""Chick Flicks"" like ""Thelma and Louise,"" or made for TV things about unfaithful or homicidal husbands, showed this as their feature presentation one evening and this is a film that really has no women in it at all.Of course, one can argue a ""Chick Flick"" is really just a film that values exploration of deep human feelings and relationships more than car chases and explosions.  If that is the case, then ""Shawshank"" is the greatest Chick Flick of them all.And I think the Greatest Film Game never fit more than here.",10
"I saw this movie for the first time a year ago. In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked #2 in the top 250. That was very weird for me because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. So I decided to go and rent it immediately. After watching the movie I was positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top 250 and the wake-up call!",10
Awesome movie 👍. Must watch movie. Acting is superb. How this movie underperformed at box office i don't understand.,10
"There's a reason this movie has been among the top 3 movies of all time for nearly 20+ years on IMDB.New movies come and go, but The Shawshank Redemption continues to be the highest rated movie around the world - and that's because it's a story of redemption, friendship and the reality of society told in a way that cuts across all cultures/beliefs.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it now. It's set in an older time, so the movie never really shows its age even though at the time of writing this the movie is nearly 30 years old.It's brilliantly acted, very emotional in ways that don't rely on cheap pandering and the music is brilliant. Might be the only movie that I've rated a 10.",10
"The best movie I have ever seen, every detail and every dialogue comes down to the heart, every line is classic! Knowledge alters your fate! One after another! Those close to Zhu are close to those who are black! Water can carry a boat and it can overturn!",9
One of the greatest films of all time. It absolutely has aged like fine wine. Never gets old. There's not a whole lot of movies that are on par with the excellence of Shawshank Redemption.,10
"I never thought one's perspective of life would affect me immensely

Acting- Everybody was good 5/5
Story- our protagonist is a Bank employee who is accused of killing his wife and her lover His life in Prison is the main plot film This is not normal film ,it will make you cry ,laugh and of course Sad

Tl:Dr- A must watch , watch it now or regret it laterTip-Dont watch trailer or any other spoilers of the film just watch movie",9
"I admit it, not being a fan of prison movies and being puzzled by the strange title, at first glance this film wasn't very appealing to me, but it ranks #1 on IMDb and that made me curious. I also admit that at first I was disappointed, the beginning seemed like another Hollywood cliché: man falsely convicted for murder, and it all looked like yet another fight-for-your-proper-rights movie. But after the first half hour I started realising that this is not a prison movie, neither is it a movie about hope or friendship. The background story is irrelevant for the main point of the film and could be exchanged with any other story where someone finds himself in a place of desperation. What is the true beauty of this movie is that it comprises the wisdom of thousands of years of human history, starting with the philosophical school of the ancient Greek and Roman Stoics and Cynisists and leading to the modern work of psychologists like Viktor Frankl. The film even plainly states the message in one scene, where Andy says that the one thing they cant take away from you is the freedom of thought and the freedom to chose your attitude. The first night in prison, Andy does not utter a syllable, although everybody expects him to break down as the apparent wimp he seems to be. Andy truly lives Stoic principles, never loosing it, always ahead of everybody's games. Because he is focused, not trying to change the things he cannot change, like the sadism of the wards or the fact that he most probably never will get parole, but step by step changing the things he can, while being observant of the little tweaks and holes he can exploit to his own advantage. At the end of the movie you realise that he had a plan from day one, and with endurance and focus managed to pull through. Also he never lets go of his guiding principles, which makes him incredibly strong in such a harsh environment. Andy does not simply hope to get released one day, he does everything in his power to regain freedom, and through this attitude creates a leverage so strong that he is even able to crush his enemies in the end. At the end also Red gets it, instead of trying to manipulate the committee into giving him parole by telling them what he thinks they want to hear, he speaks of the only thing he had the power to change, his attitude towards life, and promptly gets released. The topic alone would be sufficient to propel this movie into the top ten of the best films ever made, but it is further enhanced through a captivating story and narrative, wonderful photography, and a superb acting performance of practically every actor involved. Morgan Freeman sticks out for me, because I admittedly have a weak spot for him, but that does not diminish the contribution of the rest of the cast. I guess it will always remain debatable which movie is ""the best"", I think one should not taint the extraordinary contribution of this movie to film history with such petty discussions. Without the slightest doubt this is one of - if not the - best movie(s) I've ever seen.",10
"I'm not a fan of violent prison movies and I certainly don't watch them twice. Shawshank Redemption is the first exception to that rule. I have to admit, that I hated the few violence scenes and the shooting, but in this movie it was necessary to convey the message of hope. Although I think that this is a wonderful, touching movie, I think it's also a fairy tale. Everything that happens to the main character is an exception, rather than a rule which weakens the movie. Other than that, it's a marvelous story about friendship, survival and hope. Watch and see for yourself how a person survives hell on earth.",7
"Let me try. As a former Cop injured on the job in 1998 it's sometimes easy to despair. For many of us It's almost as if, we cannot see the blessings in our life unless they are taken from us or we lose them. This movie is about Hope. That's what makes this movie so special. there is a deep lesson in this film and like a work of abstract art, it's what you chose to take from it that makes it whatever it is. For me it's the message that no matter what, it isn't over till it's over. And to quote the film. Get busy living or get busy dying. That's a message. I'm going to try to live it out. Also the entire cast are incredible in their roles.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is such a powerful example of how people can overcome any hardship, and it gives fantastic insight on the value of time and how its never too late to live. Encapsulated in the line ""Get busy livin, or get busy dyin."" With powerful performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this is a once in a lifetime film expirience",10
Finally watched this movie and it certainly lives up to the hype. Fantastic movie with some of the best acting that you will see. The two leads are really fantastic.,10
I Thought To Myself At First When I First viewed this movie it wasn't at all going to be any worser than most movies i've seen. But I was wrong. It's the best adapted movie of all time and I think I ought say it's the best movie I've ever seen since The Dark Knight. I haven't seen The Godfather Francise Yet but don't really want to now that I've seen The Shawshank Redemption the very best movie and the top of my favorite movie lists. It's powerful and jaw-dropping and can get very emotional at times and the best thing about this film is Tim Robins the best actor of all time and Morgan Freeman clearly the main character of the film. The bad guys are the captain of the guards Mr Hatley I remember and Norton the Worton the biggest assholes I've seen in a movie that can drive you insane. And also Brookes and the guy with the beard around his cheeks can't remember his name they were good too. Best Movie of all time period 10/10,10
"It is a great movie which received 7 Academy award nominations but lost to eventual winner Forrest Gump and ranked 1# on IMDb.So there was enough curiosity to watch this one.It is a very intelligent film in terms of story telling.The director deserves kudos for extracting such fine performances from his lead pair,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman who received Academy award nominations for their respective roles. Now the main question is does it deserve the top spot on IMDb.Well,the immediate answer is NO.The Godfather may be superior to The Shawshank Redemption by all means but it manages to hold its own and is complete as a film.Shawshank is a treat for the viewers.Do watch it for its gripping story well told.",9
"There's a reason it carries a 9.3(currently lol) on IMDB. This movie is almost perfect to me. A shame really, it ran into the buzsaw of Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction for Oscars. Because this movie is a masterpiece straight up. Also, the director(Frank Darabont. Look him up) doesn't ever get nearly enough credit. Much like this awesome film.",10
"This wasn't the first prison movie I've seen. The ones I had seen before this consisted of gangs of criminals brutally murdering each other. Or it involved drug dealers who ran the prison, without the slightest sign of any law force slowing them down.This movie has those elements, but doesn't exploit them as many prison movies often do. There is no epic fight or riot scene in the end. That's what I enjoy about this movie. It's not about deranged dealers, psychotic killers, or blood thirsty rapist. There normal people (more or less) living in this world that many will never have to witness. (Be thankful for that.) I'm not really sure if this is a spoiler or not because it doesn't change much in the story, but Tim Robbins plays a man falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover. It was a misstep to make him innocent, as it would of made his character more 'real' to have made a mistake in his life that he deeply regrets, as Red has. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, is the actors best role to date, and he's had many great roles in his career. You sympathize with this character greatly and you actually come to care for his fate much more than you do Andy's (Robbins).Overall, I think this a wonderful film that is very well written (based off a great short story by the master of horror, Stephen King), well directed, perfectly acted, with a satisfying ending (though I can see how some can call it a typical 'Hollywood'ending).That being said, is classifying it number one on IMDb justice? No. I'd be more than happy with it in the top 100, but the fact is there are better films out there, some which aren't even in the top 250. So I give it a final score 8/10, I think I'm being fair when I say that.",10
"I have seen over 5000 films in the last 30 or so years. and as an amateur film critic, I am among the thousands (maybe millions) of movie buffs who also recognise that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one film that should be rated higher by film critics and be given more appreciation. It is superb!! entertainment!!  However! to be ranked higher than The Godfather,Citizen Kane,The Seven Samarai,Raging bull,etc, What gives?  If anybody can share with me their reasons for saying that this is THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME?...over some of the films that I just mentioned, please explain. Am I missing something??",1
"This film has got to go down in history as one of the best films made. Heart warming story. Enticing characters and beautiful friendship.It features Morgan freeman who is a legend within himself.All round great film. I would recommend you to watch it, I tell you too.",10
"Review #1 of ""My Top ten Favorite Movies"" Reviews I'm not going to go through a whole review, since there are plenty of reviews detailing why this is the greatest movie of all time. I'm just gonna give a quote:""The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen because of its ability to capture raw emotion."" I'm also going to elaborate on the three biggest reasons people dislike this movie.1. It's too slow.The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion.Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing ""Kumbaya""? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.3. This is not realistic.Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10, and everything higher.",10
"Gun in your hand, all evidence point you and you are declared a murderer but within you know you have not actually committed it. Law see evidence and you, Andy is behind bars of Shawshank, a prison. Your all freedom is within the bars now. An intelligent banker, Andy goes through all trouble in Shawshank. But you are unusual, you will think on how you can be free again, whereas your other mates think of living or dying in prison. A good man Andy the convicted starts his journey in jail, writing to government for fund to improve library in jail. Brings a different transformation in jail by educating uneducated. Tiredlessly writing to US Govt for more fund, impressing the warden of jail by filing tax return, advising on taxation, expenses and even children education. Helps the jail Warden and Jailor make millions by creating a false person with id in case FBI or other interrogates the money stuff. There he meets his friend Red. Red is a changed man now in jail but still get rejected by the jail authority due to political reasons. New prisoner keep coming to jail. Andy spent 19 years. One night Andy, the banker comes to know from a young prisoner that another man actually murdered his wife for whom he is on life imprisonment. Andy, the banker earlier now a prisoner appeals to Warden of jail for a trial. Warden is a corrupted person who made millions due to Andy who advised him on taxation to all money related stuff inside jail. Warden murders the young boy in fear for that the young boy will tell the truth that Andy is innocent and Andy would get freed. Warden locks Andy in a small cage as punishment. After 2 months almost living in small cage inside the jail, Andy decides whether to live life or die life in jail. That night was a dark one. It was storm and Andy got rope. Red had doubt whether Andy would suicide. The next day Warden and Jailor all together were greatly surprised to find no one in Andy's cell. How did he run from the jail? He used that imaginary person name outside whom he created while filing taxation of the jail. Andy transferred money to that imaginary person account and became that person in real after escape from Shawshank jail. Warden could not save himself since the papers were taken by Andy before his escape from Shawshank. Warden could not hide his corruption and shoot himself when caught by American police. Red later got released because he suffered what he did by spending, learning discipline in jail for about 30 years. You spend 30 to 40 years and come out of prison you find the world has changed. Some prisoners even commit suicide who later cannot take up to busy world outside. Andy tells Red if he would be freed someday he must visit a place where Andy and his wife made love. Those were Andy's best times with his love. Red travels to Texas in search of that village a place near Oak tree, finds cash money and tickets. Then Red travels to the place Andy mentioned he would be if he is free from jail .... somewhere in Mexico. Red remember the place name and finally travels to find Andy with the new name and identity looking after boats in an island.One must watch this movie to get hold onto every scene of this movie. Must watch!!! Don't you wait!",10
