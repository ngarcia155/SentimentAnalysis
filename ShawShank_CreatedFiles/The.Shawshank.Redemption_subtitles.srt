1
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,502
<i>Mr. Dufresne, describe...</i>

2
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:11,048
{\an8}...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,388
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:22,059
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:27,064
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:30,985
{\an8}-What was your response?
-I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,363
{\an8}"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:37,908
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,578
If they say so.

10
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:43,622
{\an8}I really don't remember. I was upset.

11
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,334
{\an8}What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:49,253
{\an8}She packed a bag.

13
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:53,591
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:58,346
{\an8}<i>Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...</i>

15
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:01,682
{\an8}<i>...whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.</i>

16
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,186
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,606
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:13,194
{\an8}Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:13,778 --> 00:03:15,279
{\an8}I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:16,989
<i>...and waited.</i>

21
00:03:17,198 --> 00:03:18,866
<i>With what intention?</i>

22
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,910
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

23
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,496
{\an8}<i>I was confused...</i>

24
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,955
{\an8}<i>...drunk.</i>

25
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,583
{\an8}<i>I think...</i>

26
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,960
<i>...mostly I wanted to scare them.</i>

27
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,506
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,800
No, I was sobering up.

29
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:39,678
{\an8}I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:42,848
{\an8}Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,142
{\an8}I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,355
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,149
{\an8}...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,485
{\an8}...riddled with .38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,032
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,951
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,329
{\an8}Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,581
{\an8}...before the murders took place.

39
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,000
{\an8}That's very convenient.

40
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,877
It's the truth.

41
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:16,841
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:21,137
{\an8}...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:24,765
{\an8}...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,852
And that also...

45
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,730
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,151
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:39,989
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:01,218
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.</i>

49
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:05,264
<i>We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.</i>

50
00:05:05,473 --> 00:05:08,350
<i>Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.</i>

51
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,520
{\an8}<i>A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.</i>

52
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,272
{\an8}<i>And most of all...</i>

53
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:16,567
{\an8}<i>...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...</i>

54
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,777
<i>...lying dead in each other's arms.</i>

55
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,573
{\an8}<i>They had sinned.</i>

56
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,327
{\an8}<i>But was their crime so great...</i>

57
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,787
{\an8}<i>...as to merit a death sentence?</i>

58
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,290
While you think about that...

59
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,543
...think about this:

60
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,131
{\an8}A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,052
{\an8}I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,055
{\an8}That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,264
No.

64
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,433
This was revenge...

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,270
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,856
<i>Four bullets per victim.</i>

67
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,317
<i>Not six shots fired, but eight.</i>

68
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:02,446
<i>That means that he fired
the gun empty...</i>

69
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:05,449
{\an8}<i>...and then stopped to reload...</i>

70
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:08,285
{\an8}<i>...so that he could shoot
each of them again.</i>

71
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:11,080
<i>An extra bullet per lover...</i>

72
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,624
<i>...right in the head.</i>

73
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:21,924
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,468
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:29,139
{\an8}By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,644
{\an8}...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,522
...one for each of your victims. So be it!

78
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:02,840
Sit.

79
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,180
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,351
-Yes, sir.
-You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:17,354
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,482
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,987
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,576
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,745
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:08:09,073 --> 00:08:11,867
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

87
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,244
Same old shit, different day.

88
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,372
Yeah, I know how you feel.

89
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,582
I'm up for rejection next week.

90
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,877
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

91
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:23,379
It happens.

92
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:25,005
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

93
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,509
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

94
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,718
-Four!
-Five!

95
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:34,264
<i>There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.</i>

96
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,266
<i>I'm the guy who can get it for you.</i>

97
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,603
<i>Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...</i>

98
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:43,232
<i>...a bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.</i>

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,567
<i>Damn near anything within reason.</i>

100
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,488
<i>Yes, sir.
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.</i>

101
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,369
<i>So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...</i>

102
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,123
<i>...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...</i>

103
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:01,625
<i>...I told him, "No problem."</i>

104
00:09:21,145 --> 00:09:25,315
<i>Officers
to main gate. Officers to main gate.</i>

105
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,527
<i>Secure main gate.</i>

106
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:45,669
<i>Andy came to Shawshank Prison...</i>

107
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,757
<i>...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.</i>

108
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,178
<i>On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.</i>

109
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,388
<i>Good work for a man so young.</i>

110
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,270
Hey, Red.

111
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,391
You speak English, butt-steak?

112
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,477
You follow this officer.

113
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,494
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

114
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,330
Hey, fish! Come over here!

115
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,980
Taking bets today, Red?

116
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,065
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

117
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,942
Smokes. Put me down for two.

118
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,069
All right, who's your horse?

119
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,029
That little sack of shit.

120
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:40,617
-Eighth. Eighth from the front. He'll be first.
-Oh, bullshit! I'll take that action.

121
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,328
-Yeah, me too.
-You're out some smokes, son.

122
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,289
If you're so smart, you call it.

123
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,584
I'll take the chubby fat-ass there.

124
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,378
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

125
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,339
Fresh Fish!

126
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,300
Fresh fish today!

127
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,510
We're reeling them in!

128
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,848
<i>I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.</i>

129
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,310
<i>Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.</i>

130
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,770
<i>That was my first impression of the man.</i>

131
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:10,397
What do you say?

132
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,901
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

133
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,236
That guy? Never happen.

134
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,697
-Ten cigarettes.
-That's a rich bet.

135
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:20,991
Who's going to prove me wrong?

136
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,993
Heywood? Jigger?

137
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,578
Skeets?

138
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,121
Floyd!

139
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,124
Four brave souls.

140
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,085
<i>Return to your
cellblocks for evening count.</i>

141
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,589
<i>All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.</i>

142
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,612
Turn to the right! Eyes front.

143
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,294
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

144
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:16,588
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

145
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:19,007
You are convicted felons.

146
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,301
That's why they've sent you to me.

147
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,261
Rule number one:

148
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,972
No blasphemy.

149
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,892
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

150
00:13:29,101 --> 00:13:30,310
The other rules...

151
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,814
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

152
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,232
When do we eat?

153
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:45,951
You eat when we say you eat.

154
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:49,413
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

155
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,457
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

156
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,711
On your feet.

157
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,671
I believe in two things:

158
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,340
Discipline and the Bible.

159
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:02,926
Here, you'll receive both.

160
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,846
Put your trust in the Lord.

161
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,682
Your ass belongs to me.

162
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,436
Welcome to Shawshank.

163
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,942
Unhook them.

164
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,782
Turn around.

165
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,041
That's enough.

166
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,960
Move to the end of the cage.

167
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,464
Turn around. Delouse him.

168
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,884
Turn around.

169
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,431
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

170
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,974
Next man up!

171
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,979
To the right. Right. Right. Right.

172
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,773
Left. Left.

173
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,985
<i>The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.</i>

174
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,530
<i>They march you in
naked as the day you were born...</i>

175
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:09,534
<i>...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.</i>

176
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,621
<i>And when they put you in that cell...</i>

177
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,165
<i>...and those bars slam home...</i>

178
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,834
<i>...that's when you know it's for real.</i>

179
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,421
<i>Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.</i>

180
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:26,009
<i>Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.</i>

181
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:30,514
<i>Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.</i>

182
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,767
<i>Somebody always breaks down crying.</i>

183
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,936
<i>Happens every time.</i>

184
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,647
<i>The only question is...</i>

185
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,607
<i>...who's it going to be?</i>

186
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,945
<i>It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.</i>

187
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,698
<i>I had my money on Andy Dufresne.</i>

188
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,376
Lights out!

189
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,232
<i>I remember my first night.</i>

190
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,986
<i>Seems like a long time ago.</i>

191
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,824
Hey, fish.

192
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,494
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

193
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,997
What are you, scared of the dark?

194
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,043
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

195
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:46,631
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.
Oh, yes!

196
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,596
Poke your ass out, give me a first look!

197
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,847
Shh! Keep it down.

198
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,267
<i>The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.</i>

199
00:16:57,601 --> 00:17:00,520
<i>And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.</i>

200
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,523
Hey, Fat Ass.

201
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,359
Fat Ass!

202
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,279
Talk to me, boy.

203
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,657
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

204
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,827
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

205
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,954
This place ain't so bad.

206
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,623
Tell you what...

207
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,960
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

208
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,547
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

209
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,716
...love to make your acquaintance.

210
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,428
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

211
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:34,721
God!

212
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,806
I don't belong here!

213
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,809
-We have a winner!
-I want to go home!

214
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,771
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

215
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,277
<i>Fresh fish!
Fresh fish! Fresh fish!</i>

216
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,655
I don't belong here.

217
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,242
I want to go home!

218
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,452
I want my mother!

219
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,788
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

220
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,253
What the Christ is this horseshit?

221
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,546
He blasphemed.
I'll tell the warden.

222
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,175
-You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!
-You gotta let me out!

223
00:18:12,384 --> 00:18:15,804
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

224
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,015
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

225
00:18:19,516 --> 00:18:20,558
Not me!

226
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,103
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

227
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:25,355
You will shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

228
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,566
-Shut up, man. Shut up!
-There's been a mistake.

229
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:31,987
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

230
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,488
Open that cell.

231
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:36,950
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

232
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,459
Son of a bitch!

233
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,717
Captain, take it easy!

234
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,367
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

235
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,996
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

236
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,832
Every last motherfucker in here.

237
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:32,922
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

238
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,900
<i>His first night in the joint,
Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.</i>

239
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:55,111
<i>He never made a sound.</i>

240
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,712
Tier 3 north, clear count!

241
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,757
-Tier 2 north, clear.
-Tier 2 south, clear.

242
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:19,010
-Tier 3 south, clear.
-Tier 1 north, clear.

243
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,639
-Tier 1 south, clear.
-Tier 4 south, clear.

244
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:24,808
Prepare to roll out.

245
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:29,896
Roll out!

246
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,994
Are you going to eat that?

247
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,913
I hadn't planned on it.

248
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:31,207
Do you mind?

249
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,217
That's nice and ripe.

250
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,023
Jake says thank you.

251
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,693
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

252
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,490
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

253
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,409
Oh, no, no! Here he comes.

254
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:11,206
Morning, fellas.

255
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,374
Fine morning, isn't it?

256
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,919
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

257
00:22:16,211 --> 00:22:18,421
Come on, send them down.
I want them all lined up...

258
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,257
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

259
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:23,593
Yeah, look at that.

260
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,263
-I can't stand this guy.
-Oh, Lord!

261
00:22:27,931 --> 00:22:30,433
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

262
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,976
Smell my ass!

263
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,853
After he smells mine.

264
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,316
Gee, Red, that's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

265
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,361
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

266
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,572
I believe I owe that boy a great big
sloppy kiss when I see him.

267
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:48,952
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

268
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,787
Hey, Tyrell.

269
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,122
You pull infirmary duty this week?

270
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,667
How's that horse of mine doing anyway?

271
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,210
Dead.

272
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,255
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

273
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,632
Doc had gone home for the night.

274
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,426
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

275
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,096
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

276
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:15,687
What was his name?

277
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,316
What'd you say?

278
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:24,654
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

279
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:28,074
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

280
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:32,203
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

281
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,308
Hey.

282
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,269
Anybody come at you yet?

283
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:00,231
Anybody get to you yet?

284
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,444
Hey, we all need friends in here.

285
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,404
I could be a friend to you.

286
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,117
Hey.

287
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,040
Hard to get.

288
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,627
I like that.

289
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,803
<i>Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.</i>

290
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,097
<i>I guess he had a lot on his mind...</i>

291
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:36,392
<i>...trying to adapt
to life on the inside.</i>

292
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:40,313
<i>Wasn't until a month went by
that he finally opened his mouth...</i>

293
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:42,899
<i>...to say more than two words
to somebody.</i>

294
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,652
<i>As it turned out...</i>

295
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,987
<i>...that somebody was me.</i>

296
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:54,786
<i>Officers Russell
and Berwell, report to duty officer.</i>

297
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,579
<i>Russell and Berwell, report to...</i>

298
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,539
I'm Andy Dufresne.

299
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,501
Wife-killing banker.

300
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,088
Why'd you do it?

301
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,590
I didn't, since you ask.

302
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,009
You're going to fit right in.

303
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,929
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

304
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:16,766
-What you in here for?
-Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

305
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,355
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

306
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,150
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

307
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:27,819
What do you think?

308
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,280
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

309
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:35,201
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

310
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,455
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

311
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:41,624
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

312
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,252
-A what?
-A rock hammer.

313
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,296
-What is it and why?
-What do you care?

314
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,342
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

315
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,970
But then a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

316
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,973
Fair enough.

317
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,017
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

318
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,562
-Looks like a miniature pickax.
-Pickax?

319
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,981
-For rocks.
-Rocks.

320
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:07,817
Quartz?

321
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,403
Quartz.

322
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:15,199
And some mica, shale...

323
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:17,702
...limestone.

324
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:19,078
So?

325
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:21,831
So I'm a rock hound.

326
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:25,376
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

327
00:26:25,668 --> 00:26:28,755
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

328
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,841
No, sir. No, I have no enemies here.

329
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:34,343
No? Wait a while.

330
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,555
Word gets around.

331
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:40,725
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

332
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,895
Especially Bogs.

333
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:48,357
Don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

334
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,984
Neither are they.

335
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:53,654
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

336
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,538
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

337
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:06,292
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

338
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:09,253
-Thanks for the advice.
-Well, that's free.

339
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,547
You understand my concern.

340
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:15,092
If there's any trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer, okay?

341
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:19,347
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

342
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,891
Did I miss something? What's so funny?

343
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:25,019
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

344
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,065
What's an item like this usually go for?

345
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:31,776
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

346
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,737
My normal markup's 20 percent.

347
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:37,323
But this is a specialty item.

348
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:41,994
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

349
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,538
Ten it is.

350
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:47,291
Waste of money, if you ask me.

351
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,876
Why's that?

352
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:53,297
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

353
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,884
They find it, you're going to lose it.

354
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,178
If they do catch you with it,
you don't know me.

355
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,597
You mention my name,
we never do business again.

356
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:05,226
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

357
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,603
I understand.

358
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,940
Thank you, Mr...

359
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,149
Red.

360
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,193
-Name's Red.
-Red.

361
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:17,280
Why do they call you that?

362
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,035
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

363
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,088
<i>I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.</i>

364
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:37,383
<i>He had a quiet way about him...</i>

365
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:41,888
<i>...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.</i>

366
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,681
<i>He strolled...</i>

367
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:48,102
<i>...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.</i>

368
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:52,982
<i>Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.</i>

369
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:57,153
<i>Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...</i>

370
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:59,655
<i>...I liked Andy from the start.</i>

371
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,994
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

372
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:10,833
Move it! Come on, move it!

373
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:16,339
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

374
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,977
Keep it moving.

375
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,024
Red.

376
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:55,962
<i>Andy was right.</i>

377
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,422
<i>I finally got the joke.</i>

378
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,133
<i>It would take a man about 600 years...</i>

379
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:03,803
<i>...to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.</i>

380
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,017
-Book?
-Not today.

381
00:30:16,065 --> 00:30:18,067
-Book?
-No.

382
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,946
Hey, Brooksie.

383
00:30:24,407 --> 00:30:26,575
Delivery for Dufresne.

384
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,751
-Book?
-Pass.

385
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:38,879
Book?

386
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:45,845
Dufresne, here's your book.

387
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,101
Thanks.

388
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:02,069
Dufresne, we're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

389
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,941
This will blind you.

390
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:43,694
Honey, hush.

391
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,209
That's it. You fight!

392
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,877
Better that way.

393
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:11,222
<i>I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight...</i>

394
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,432
<i>...and the Sisters let him be.</i>

395
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,851
<i>I wish I could tell you that...</i>

396
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,021
<i>...but prison is no fairy-tale world.</i>

397
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,108
<i>He never said who did it.</i>

398
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:23,943
<i>But we all knew.</i>

399
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,283
<i>Things went on like that for a while.</i>

400
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,203
<i>Prison life consists of routine...</i>

401
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,413
<i>...and then more routine.</i>

402
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:42,461
<i>Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.</i>

403
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:45,756
<i>The Sisters kept at him.</i>

404
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,050
<i>Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.</i>

405
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,760
<i>Sometimes not.</i>

406
00:32:50,928 --> 00:32:53,097
<i>And that's how it went for Andy.</i>

407
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:55,432
<i>That was his routine.</i>

408
00:32:56,267 --> 00:32:59,728
<i>I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.</i>

409
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:03,566
<i>And I also believe
if things had gone on that way...</i>

410
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,360
<i>...this place would have
got the best of him.</i>

411
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,905
<i>But then, in the spring of 1949...</i>

412
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:12,032
<i>...the powers that be decided that:</i>

413
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:15,578
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

414
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,956
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

415
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:21,125
As you know...

416
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,421
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

417
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:28,048
<i>It was outdoor detail...</i>

418
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:32,720
<i>...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.</i>

419
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,263
Stay in line there.

420
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,641
<i>More than 100 men
volunteered for the job.</i>

421
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,940
"Wallace E. Unger.

422
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,776
Ellis Redding."

423
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:49,570
<i>Wouldn't you know it?</i>

424
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:53,282
<i>Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.</i>

425
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:55,492
"Andrew Dufresne."

426
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,829
<i>It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.</i>

427
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,790
<i>I made my usual 20 percent, of course.</i>

428
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:05,461
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

429
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,254
I say, "Yeah?"

430
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:11,133
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

431
00:34:11,342 --> 00:34:15,262
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-I'm not. He was an asshole.

432
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,640
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

433
00:34:17,848 --> 00:34:20,142
So anyway, this lawyer fellow says to me:

434
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:24,480
"Your brother died a rich man."
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

435
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:27,024
-A million bucks?
-Yeah.

436
00:34:27,316 --> 00:34:31,820
-Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
-You going to see any of that?

437
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:35,199
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

438
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,159
-Dollars?
-Yep.

439
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:40,329
Holy shit, that's great!
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

440
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:41,830
Isn't it?

441
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,959
Dumb-shit, what do you think
the government is gonna do to me?

442
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,503
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

443
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,630
Poor Byron.

444
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:53,676
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

445
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,178
Some people really got it awful.

446
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,805
Andy, are you nuts?

447
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,890
Keep your eyes on your mop, man! Andy.

448
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:03,060
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up--

449
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:06,063
Yeah, yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

450
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:08,440
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

451
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:12,403
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

452
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:16,323
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

453
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,659
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

454
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,288
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

455
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,039
Andy. Andy. Andy.

456
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,710
-Getting himself killed.
-Keep tarring.

457
00:35:27,918 --> 00:35:30,462
Some brother. Shit!

458
00:35:30,963 --> 00:35:32,006
Hey!

459
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:36,802
Mr. Hadley...

460
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,054
...do you trust your wife?

461
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,141
Oh, that's funny.

462
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:45,352
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

463
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,856
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

464
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:53,402
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

465
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:54,695
He'll push him off!

466
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,739
Because if you trust her, you can keep...

467
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,324
...that 35,000.

468
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:01,234
-What did you say?
-Thirty-five thousand.

469
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:03,120
-Thirty-five thousand.
-All of it.

470
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:04,647
-All of it?
-Every penny.

471
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,707
You better start making sense.

472
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,251
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

473
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:13,339
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

474
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,924
-Bullshit. Tax-free?
-Tax-free.

475
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:18,093
IRS can't touch one cent.

476
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:20,929
You're that smart banker
what killed his wife, aren't you?

477
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,558
Why should I believe a smart banker?
So I can end up in here with you?

478
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,603
It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

479
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:31,857
Actually, I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

480
00:36:32,066 --> 00:36:35,736
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

481
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:39,323
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set up the tax-free gift for you.

482
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,116
That'll cost you.
A lawyer, for example.

483
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,577
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

484
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:47,498
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

485
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,792
You get the forms,
I'll prepare them for you...

486
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,752
...nearly free of charge.

487
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,298
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

488
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,635
"Coworkers." That's rich, ain't it?

489
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:02,137
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

490
00:37:02,346 --> 00:37:05,808
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

491
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,267
...sir.

492
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:13,148
What are you jimmies staring at?

493
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,942
Let's go! Work!

494
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,370
<i>And that's how it came to pass...</i>

495
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,248
<i>...that on the second-to-last
day of the job...</i>

496
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:34,002
<i>...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...</i>

497
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,339
<i>...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...</i>

498
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:43,011
<i>...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...</i>

499
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,515
<i>...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.</i>

500
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:49,143
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

501
00:37:50,227 --> 00:37:54,815
<i>The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.</i>

502
00:37:55,941 --> 00:38:00,404
<i>We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.</i>

503
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:04,199
<i>Hell, we could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.</i>

504
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:07,244
<i>We were the lords of all creation.</i>

505
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,413
<i>As for Andy...</i>

506
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:12,291
<i>...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...</i>

507
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:15,002
<i>...a strange little smile on his face...</i>

508
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,421
<i>...watching us drink his beer.</i>

509
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:26,889
Hey. Want a cold one, Andy?

510
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,517
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

511
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,566
<i>You could argue he'd done it
to curry a favor with the guards.</i>

512
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:42,070
<i>Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.</i>

513
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,864
<i>Me?</i>

514
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,867
<i>I think he did it
just to feel normal again...</i>

515
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:49,536
<i>...if only for a short while.</i>

516
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,248
King me.

517
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,753
-Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
-What?

518
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,713
Civilized. Strategic.

519
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,383
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

520
00:39:03,634 --> 00:39:05,427
Let me teach you someday.

521
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:07,930
Sure.

522
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,140
We could get a board together.

523
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,435
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

524
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,648
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

525
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:21,151
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

526
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:23,153
I think it'll take years.

527
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:25,906
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

528
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:28,075
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

529
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,118
Pebbles, mostly.

530
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:37,251
Andy, we're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

531
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,670
Yeah, I guess.

532
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:41,838
Can I ask you something?

533
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,758
Why'd you do it?

534
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:47,553
I'm innocent, Red.

535
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:49,805
Just like everybody else here.

536
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:55,686
What are you in for?

537
00:39:58,397 --> 00:40:00,566
Murder. Same as you.

538
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:01,942
Innocent?

539
00:40:04,653 --> 00:40:07,030
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

540
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,920
<i>Perimeter check.
North wall.</i>

541
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:07,883
<i>Where's the canary?</i>

542
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,384
<i>How did you know?</i>

543
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,887
<i>-How did I know what?
-So you don't know.</i>

544
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,221
<i>Come.</i>

545
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:17,851
<i>This is where the canary is, Johnny.</i>

546
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,857
<i>Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?</i>

547
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,737
<i>That's quite a...</i>

548
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,365
<i>...surprise.</i>

549
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:37,079
-Red?
-Wait, wait.

550
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:39,081
Here she comes.

551
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:42,250
This is the part I really like,
when she does that shit with her hair.

552
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,170
Oh, yeah, I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

553
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,255
<i>Gilda, are you decent?</i>

554
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,424
<i>Me?</i>

555
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,927
-Oh!
-Oh.

556
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,887
God, I love it.

557
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:02,062
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

558
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:06,775
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

559
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,111
-Rita Hayworth.
-What?

560
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:11,071
Can you get her?

561
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,826
<i>So this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you.</i>

562
00:42:17,077 --> 00:42:19,371
-Take a few weeks.
-Weeks?

563
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:23,959
Yeah, I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

564
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,877
But I'll get her.

565
00:42:26,086 --> 00:42:27,421
Relax.

566
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,590
Thanks.

567
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:33,260
<i>It was.
You should've seen his face.</i>

568
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:34,428
Sit down.

569
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,762
<i>Did you tell him what I'm...?</i>

570
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,180
Down in front.

571
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,517
<i>-I wanted to save that as a surprise.
-Hang on to your hat.</i>

572
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,978
<i>Gilda is my wife.</i>

573
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,946
-Take a walk!
-I got to change the reel!

574
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,157
I said fuck off!

575
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,664
Ain't you going to scream?

576
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,876
Let's get this over with.

577
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,008
He broke my fucking nose!

578
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:23,518
Now...

579
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,188
...I'm going to open my fly...

580
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:29,191
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

581
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,944
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

582
00:43:33,153 --> 00:43:35,280
I think ye ought to have
something to show for it.

583
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:37,369
Anything you put it in my mouth,
you'll lose it.

584
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:40,160
No, you don't understand.

585
00:43:40,494 --> 00:43:43,538
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this steel in your ear.

586
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:47,209
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

587
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,336
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

588
00:43:50,796 --> 00:43:53,048
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

589
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:56,301
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

590
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,886
...with a crowbar.

591
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,390
Where do you get this shit?

592
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:03,975
I read it.

593
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,063
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

594
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,024
Honey.

595
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,486
You shouldn't!

596
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,075
<i>Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.</i>

597
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,410
<i>And neither did his friends.</i>

598
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:26,665
<i>What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.</i>

599
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,835
<i>Andy spent a month in the infirmary.</i>

600
00:44:30,627 --> 00:44:33,171
<i>Bogs spent a week in the hole.</i>

601
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:38,760
Time's up, Bogs.

602
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,266
It's your world, boss.

603
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,313
<i>Return to
your cellblocks for evening count.</i>

604
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:53,191
<i>All prisoners report for lockdown.</i>

605
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:09,124
What?

606
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:24,306
-Where's he going?
-Grab his ankles.

607
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:31,396
No! No! Help me!

608
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,652
<i>Two things never happened
again after that.</i>

609
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:41,072
<i>The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.</i>

610
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,409
<i>And Bogs never walked again.</i>

611
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:49,080
<i>They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.</i>

612
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,791
<i>To my knowledge,
he lived out the rest of his days...</i>

613
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,085
<i>...drinking his food through a straw.</i>

614
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:59,174
Andy could use a nice "welcome back"
when he gets out of the infirmary.

615
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,510
Sounds good to us.

616
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:05,263
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

617
00:46:06,014 --> 00:46:08,266
The man likes to play chess.

618
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:10,685
Let's get him some rocks.

619
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,552
Guys!

620
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,388
I got one.

621
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,056
I got one. Look!

622
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:54,062
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

623
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:56,147
What are you, a fucking geologist?

624
00:46:56,356 --> 00:46:58,066
He's right. It ain't.

625
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:01,194
-What the hell is it then?
-It's a horse apple.

626
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,572
-Bullshit!
-No, horseshit.

627
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,241
Petrified.

628
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,748
Oh, Jesus.

629
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,418
Damn!

630
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:20,964
<i>Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.</i>

631
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,174
<i>And by the weekend
he was due back...</i>

632
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:27,095
<i>...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.</i>

633
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:30,432
<i>Also got a big shipment in that week.</i>

634
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:31,808
<i>Cigarettes...</i>

635
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,059
<i>...chewing gum...</i>

636
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:34,728
<i>...sipping whiskey...</i>

637
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:38,314
<i>...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.</i>

638
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:41,276
<i>And, of course, the most important item:</i>

639
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,196
<i>Rita Hayworth herself.</i>

640
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:22,108
-Okay, look alive!
-Open all tiers.

641
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,569
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

642
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:27,489
Heads up. They're tossing the cells!

643
00:48:29,074 --> 00:48:30,575
119.

644
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,079
123.

645
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:45,340
On your feet.

646
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,511
Face the wall.

647
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,547
Turn around and face the warden.

648
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:34,222
Pleased to see you reading this.

649
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:37,475
Any favorite passages?

650
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:40,728
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

651
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:43,148
...when the master
of the house cometh."

652
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:46,442
Mark 13:35.

653
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,070
I've always liked that one.

654
00:49:49,988 --> 00:49:51,656
But I prefer:

655
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:53,992
"I am the light of the world.

656
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:57,745
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

657
00:49:57,954 --> 00:50:00,582
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

658
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:02,917
I hear you're good with numbers.

659
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:04,085
How nice.

660
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:07,255
Man should have a skill.

661
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:10,842
Wanna explain this?

662
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:16,097
It's called a rock blanket.
For shaping and polishing rocks.

663
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,433
A little hobby of mine.

664
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:30,737
It's pretty clean.

665
00:50:30,987 --> 00:50:34,115
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

666
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:40,455
I can't say I approve of this.

667
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:43,541
But I suppose...

668
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:47,629
...exceptions can be made.

669
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,307
Lock them up!

670
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:03,811
I almost forgot.

671
00:51:04,229 --> 00:51:06,397
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

672
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,067
Salvation lies within.

673
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,318
Yes, sir.

674
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,412
<i>Tossing cells was just an excuse.</i>

675
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:23,164
<i>Truth is...</i>

676
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,833
<i>...Norton wanted to size Andy up.</i>

677
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:41,849
My wife made that in church group.

678
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,812
Very nice, sir.

679
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:48,856
You enjoy working the laundry?

680
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,193
No, sir. Not especially.

681
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:54,988
Perhaps we can find something more...

682
00:51:55,238 --> 00:51:57,699
...befitting a man of your education.

683
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,250
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

684
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:11,879
Andy. I thought I heard you out here.

685
00:52:12,547 --> 00:52:14,090
I've been reassigned to you.

686
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,718
I know, they told me.

687
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:19,595
Ain't that a kick in the head?

688
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:22,098
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

689
00:52:22,307 --> 00:52:23,474
Come on.

690
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,602
Well, here she is.

691
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,813
The Shawshank Prison Library.

692
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,482
<i>National Geographics...</i>

693
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,194
<i>...Reader's Digest</i> condensed books...

694
00:52:35,403 --> 00:52:36,988
...and Louis L'Amour.

695
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:39,407
<i>Look</i> magazine.

696
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:42,076
Erle Stanley Gardners.

697
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:45,788
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

698
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,666
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

699
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,753
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

700
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:55,548
-Any questions?
-Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

701
00:52:55,757 --> 00:53:00,762
Oh... I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

702
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:04,265
And have you ever had an assistant?

703
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,934
No. Not much to it, really.

704
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:08,936
Why me? Why now?

705
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:10,646
I don't know.

706
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:13,900
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

707
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,943
Dufresne!

708
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,455
That's him. That's the one.

709
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:36,255
I'm Dekins.

710
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:38,299
I was...

711
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:42,804
...thinking about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

712
00:53:45,098 --> 00:53:48,184
Oh. I see.

713
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:51,896
Well, um...

714
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:56,275
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

715
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:02,448
Brooks, do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

716
00:54:13,793 --> 00:54:15,086
Thanks.

717
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:16,838
So...

718
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,341
Mr. Dekins...

719
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,261
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

720
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:26,472
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

721
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:27,723
He didn't say that!

722
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,560
As God as my witness!

723
00:54:30,852 --> 00:54:32,562
Dekins just blinked for a second...

724
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:35,898
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

725
00:54:36,357 --> 00:54:38,693
-My ass!
-Shook his hand.

726
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,737
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

727
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:46,200
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

728
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:49,036
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

729
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:50,872
Making a few friends, huh, Andy?

730
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:53,833
I wouldn't say "friends."

731
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:57,879
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

732
00:54:58,045 --> 00:55:00,381
It's a wonderful pet to have.

733
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,383
Got you out of the laundry, though.

734
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:04,844
It might do more than that.

735
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,763
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

736
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,558
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

737
00:55:11,309 --> 00:55:15,271
-Right.
-How do you expect to do that? I mean...

738
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,441
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

739
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,401
I'll ask the warden for funds.

740
00:55:21,861 --> 00:55:26,115
Son, son, son, six wardens have been
through here in my tenure, and I've learned...

741
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,743
...one immutable, universal truth:

742
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,204
Not one of them born whose asshole...

743
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:35,416
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

744
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:39,212
-The budget's stretched thin as it is.
-I see.

745
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,840
Perhaps I could write the state senate
and request funds directly from them.

746
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:47,136
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

747
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:49,764
More walls, more bars, more guards.

748
00:55:49,972 --> 00:55:52,642
Still, I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

749
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:55,603
-They can't ignore me forever.
-Sure can.

750
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,523
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

751
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:01,442
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

752
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,905
<i>So Andy started writing
a letter a week...</i>

753
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,698
<i>...just like he said.</i>

754
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:14,497
<i>And, just like Norton said...</i>

755
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,165
<i>...Andy got no answers.</i>

756
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:29,303
<i>The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.</i>

757
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,890
<i>Year after that, he did them all...</i>

758
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,059
<i>...including the warden's.</i>

759
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:40,273
<i>Year after that,
they rescheduled the intramural season...</i>

760
00:56:40,481 --> 00:56:42,900
<i>...to coincide with tax season.</i>

761
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:48,948
<i>The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.</i>

762
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:52,952
So Moresby Prison issued you a gun,
but you actually paid for it.

763
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,870
Damn right. The holster too.

764
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,540
See, that's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

765
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:00,793
<i>Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.</i>

766
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:06,007
<i>In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.</i>

767
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:08,718
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

768
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:13,764
<i>Got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year, and that was fine.</i>

769
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:18,185
<i>And still, he kept sending those letters.</i>

770
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:24,775
Red. Red. Andy.

771
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:25,985
It's Brooks.

772
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:28,613
Watch the door.

773
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,197
Please, Brooks.

774
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,241
-Calm the fuck down.
-Stay back!

775
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,827
-Stay back, goddamn it!
-What's going on?

776
00:57:34,994 --> 00:57:38,039
You tell me. One second he's fine,
then out come the knife.

777
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,082
Brooks. We can talk about this, right?

778
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:44,086
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

779
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,088
What's he done to you?

780
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:47,965
It's what they done!

781
00:57:48,466 --> 00:57:49,717
I got no choice.

782
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,511
Brooks, you won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

783
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,181
-Right, Heywood?
-Sure. I know that.

784
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,726
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

785
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:00,895
-Right, guys?
-Yes.

786
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:03,564
So put the knife down.
Brooks, look at me.

787
00:58:03,731 --> 00:58:07,735
Put the knife down. Brooks.

788
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:10,071
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

789
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:13,157
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

790
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:15,534
It's the only--

791
00:58:15,743 --> 00:58:17,787
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

792
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,414
Come on, this is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

793
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22,750
Put it--Put it down.

794
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:33,010
Hey. Hey. Take it easy.

795
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,262
You'll be all right.

796
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,890
Him? What about me?

797
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,476
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

798
00:58:40,685 --> 00:58:42,603
You've had worse from shaving.

799
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,522
What did you do to set him off?

800
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:47,316
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

801
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,611
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

802
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,741
I just don't understand
what happened in there, that's all.

803
00:58:55,908 --> 00:58:58,744
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

804
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,830
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

805
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,791
-Heard he had you shitting in your pants.
-Fuck you.

806
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:05,251
Knock it off.

807
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,628
Brooks ain't no bug.

808
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:09,630
He's just--

809
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,259
He's just institutionalized.

810
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,554
"Institutionalized," my ass.

811
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:20,766
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

812
00:59:20,975 --> 00:59:22,685
This is all he knows.

813
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,187
In here, he's an important man...

814
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,480
...an educated man.

815
00:59:27,314 --> 00:59:29,233
Outside, he's nothing.

816
00:59:30,109 --> 00:59:33,612
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

817
00:59:33,821 --> 00:59:36,824
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

818
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:38,826
You know what I'm trying to say?

819
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,996
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

820
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:45,499
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

821
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,502
But I tell you these walls are funny.

822
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,756
First you hate them.

823
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:55,509
Then you get used to them.

824
00:59:57,428 --> 00:59:59,430
Enough time passes...

825
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,099
...you get so you depend on them.

826
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,311
That's "institutionalized."

827
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,774
-Shit. I could never get like that.
-Oh, yeah?

828
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:13,152
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

829
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,945
Goddamn right.

830
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,450
They send you here for life...

831
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:22,453
...that's exactly what they take.

832
01:00:24,205 --> 01:00:26,207
Part that counts, anyway.

833
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:36,717
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

834
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,553
You go on now.

835
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,306
You're free.

836
01:00:43,557 --> 01:00:45,142
You're free.

837
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:03,994
Bye. Joe?

838
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,830
Good luck, Brooksie.

839
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:10,209
Take care of yourself, Brooks.

840
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,286
<i>Dear fellas:</i>

841
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:49,790
<i>I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.</i>

842
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,752
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

843
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:58,465
<i>I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...</i>

844
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:01,552
<i>...but now they're everywhere.</i>

845
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:09,518
<i>The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.</i>

846
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:29,121
<i>The parole board
got me into this halfway house...</i>

847
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:31,081
<i>...called "The Brewer"...</i>

848
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,458
<i>...and a job...</i>

849
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,628
<i>...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.</i>

850
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,590
<i>It's hard work and I try to keep up...</i>

851
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:42,176
<i>...but my hands hurt most of the time.</i>

852
01:02:42,468 --> 01:02:47,348
Make sure your man double-bags.
Last time, the bottom near came out.

853
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,267
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

854
01:02:50,476 --> 01:02:51,852
Yes, sir. Surely will.

855
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:55,564
<i>I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.</i>

856
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:02,863
<i>Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.</i>

857
01:03:03,322 --> 01:03:04,823
<i>I keep thinking...</i>

858
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:08,369
<i>...Jake might just show up
and say hello.</i>

859
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,996
<i>But he never does.</i>

860
01:03:12,206 --> 01:03:17,044
<i>I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.</i>

861
01:03:20,673 --> 01:03:23,384
<i>I have trouble sleeping at night.</i>

862
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,971
<i>I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.</i>

863
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:29,473
<i>I wake up scared.</i>

864
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:33,894
<i>Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.</i>

865
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:40,317
<i>Maybe I should get me a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.</i>

866
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:44,947
<i>I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.</i>

867
01:03:46,615 --> 01:03:50,619
<i>I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.</i>

868
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,579
<i>I don't like it here.</i>

869
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:56,792
<i>I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...</i>

870
01:03:57,626 --> 01:03:59,294
<i>...not to stay.</i>

871
01:04:10,222 --> 01:04:12,766
<i>I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...</i>

872
01:04:12,975 --> 01:04:16,478
<i>...not for an old crook like me.</i>

873
01:05:18,957 --> 01:05:23,212
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

874
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:28,092
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

875
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,636
No hard feelings. Brooks."

876
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:43,065
He should have died in here.

877
01:05:48,612 --> 01:05:50,052
What the fuck have you done?

878
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:52,866
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

879
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:02,167
-What's all this?
-You tell me. They're addressed to you.

880
01:06:03,418 --> 01:06:04,753
Take it.

881
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:14,805
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

882
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:17,891
In response to your repeated inquiries...

883
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,396
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

884
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:24,982
This is $200.

885
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:29,194
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

886
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,947
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

887
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:36,285
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

888
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:38,370
Please stop sending us letters."

889
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:41,206
I want all this cleared out
before the warden gets back.

890
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:42,583
Yes, sir.

891
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:48,046
Good for you, Andy.

892
01:06:50,841 --> 01:06:52,259
Wow.

893
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:55,262
It only took six years.

894
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:59,600
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

895
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:03,103
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

896
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:05,814
...like he said.
I've got to pinch a loaf.

897
01:07:06,023 --> 01:07:07,482
When I come back...

898
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,443
...this is all gone, all right?

899
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,618
Do you hear that?

900
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:11,815
Dufresne! Dufresne!

901
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,567
Andy, let me out!

902
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:25,412
<i>I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.</i>

903
01:09:25,704 --> 01:09:27,914
<i>Truth is, I don't want to know.</i>

904
01:09:28,123 --> 01:09:30,625
<i>Some things are best left unsaid.</i>

905
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,923
<i>I like to think it was something
so beautiful...</i>

906
01:09:37,132 --> 01:09:39,259
<i>...it can't be expressed in words...</i>

907
01:09:39,468 --> 01:09:42,387
<i>...and makes your heart ache
because of it.</i>

908
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:46,558
<i>I tell you, those voices soared...</i>

909
01:09:46,808 --> 01:09:51,104
<i>...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.</i>

910
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:54,691
<i>It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...</i>

911
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,652
<i>...and made those walls dissolve away.</i>

912
01:09:58,111 --> 01:10:00,280
<i>And for the briefest of moments...</i>

913
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:03,492
<i>...every last man at Shawshank felt free.</i>

914
01:10:06,078 --> 01:10:08,747
<i>It pissed the warden off
something awful.</i>

915
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,041
Open the door.

916
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,712
Open it up!

917
01:10:17,005 --> 01:10:19,758
Dufresne, open this door!

918
01:10:21,093 --> 01:10:22,302
Turn that off!

919
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:31,812
I am warning you. Turn that off!

920
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:47,577
Dufresne.

921
01:10:49,538 --> 01:10:51,081
You're mine now.

922
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,758
<i>Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.</i>

923
01:11:01,967 --> 01:11:03,552
On your feet.

924
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,139
-Hey, look who's here.
-Maestro!

925
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:08,515
Hey.

926
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,561
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

927
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:15,689
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

928
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:19,025
-Was it worth two weeks?
-Easiest time I ever did.

929
01:11:19,234 --> 01:11:21,570
No such thing as easy time in the hole.

930
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,447
A week in the hole is like a year.

931
01:11:23,655 --> 01:11:26,950
-Damn straight.
-I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

932
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:30,120
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

933
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:33,915
It was in here.

934
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,001
In here.

935
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,212
That's the beauty of music. They...

936
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:41,756
...can't get that from you.

937
01:11:45,302 --> 01:11:47,679
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

938
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:52,601
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

939
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,353
Lost interest in it, though.

940
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,147
Didn't make much sense in here.

941
01:11:57,481 --> 01:11:59,483
Here's where it makes
the most sense.

942
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:02,068
You need it so you don't forget.

943
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:03,945
Forget?

944
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:07,324
Forget that there are...

945
01:12:07,532 --> 01:12:08,950
...places...

946
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:13,288
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

947
01:12:14,289 --> 01:12:15,790
There's something...

948
01:12:16,124 --> 01:12:17,542
...inside...

949
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:19,753
...that they can't get to...

950
01:12:19,961 --> 01:12:21,379
...that they can't touch.

951
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:23,298
That's yours.

952
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,426
What are you talking about?

953
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:28,720
Hope.

954
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:31,097
Hope.

955
01:12:33,058 --> 01:12:35,060
Let me tell you something, my friend.

956
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:38,146
Hope is a dangerous thing.

957
01:12:39,314 --> 01:12:41,650
Hope can drive a man insane.

958
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,528
It's got no use on the inside.

959
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,947
You'd better get used to that idea.

960
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:50,951
Like Brooks did?

961
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,310
Sit down.

962
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:25,944
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

963
01:13:27,112 --> 01:13:29,155
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

964
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:30,615
Oh, yes, sir.

965
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:33,201
Without a doubt.

966
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:36,788
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

967
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,709
No danger to society here.

968
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:42,794
God's honest truth.

969
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,465
Absolutely rehabilitated.

970
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:58,768
Thirty years.

971
01:14:00,729 --> 01:14:02,647
Jesus, when you say it like that...

972
01:14:03,523 --> 01:14:05,317
You wonder where it went.

973
01:14:07,736 --> 01:14:09,904
I wonder where 10 years went.

974
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:15,910
Here.

975
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:19,080
A little parole-rejection present.

976
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,042
Go ahead and open it.

977
01:14:23,168 --> 01:14:25,211
Went through one of your competitors.

978
01:14:25,378 --> 01:14:28,548
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

979
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:40,060
It's very pretty, Andy.

980
01:14:41,770 --> 01:14:42,979
Thank you.

981
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,025
You going to play it?

982
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:52,864
No.

983
01:14:56,451 --> 01:14:57,869
Not right now.

984
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:16,638
Roll in!

985
01:15:52,841 --> 01:15:54,092
Lights out!

986
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:30,837
<i>Andy was as good as his word.</i>

987
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:33,965
<i>He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.</i>

988
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:40,138
<i>In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...</i>

989
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,516
<i>...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.</i>

990
01:16:43,683 --> 01:16:48,021
<i>Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...</i>

991
01:16:48,188 --> 01:16:50,106
<i>...just to shut him up.</i>

992
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:53,318
<i>And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.</i>

993
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:56,446
<i>He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.</i>

994
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,407
<i>He bought remaindered books
by the pound...</i>

995
01:16:59,908 --> 01:17:01,451
<i>"Treasure Island."</i>

996
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,328
Robert Louis---

997
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:04,537
Stevenson.

998
01:17:04,746 --> 01:17:06,164
Fiction, adventure.

999
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:09,751
What's next?

1000
01:17:09,918 --> 01:17:13,004
I got here Auto Repair...

1001
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:14,881
...and Soap Carving.

1002
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:18,343
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

1003
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:20,386
<i>"Count of Monte Crisco."</i>

1004
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:23,181
That's "Cristo," you dumb-shit.

1005
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:25,266
By Alexandree...

1006
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,018
...Dum-ass.

1007
01:17:27,352 --> 01:17:28,394
Dumb-ass.

1008
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:31,731
Dumb-ass?

1009
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:37,946
-Dumas. Know what that's about?
-Huh.

1010
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:40,907
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

1011
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:44,953
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

1012
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:49,916
<i>The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.</i>

1013
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,252
<i>By the year Kennedy was shot...</i>

1014
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:57,006
<i>...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...</i>

1015
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:00,426
<i>...into the best prison library
in New England...</i>

1016
01:18:01,094 --> 01:18:04,055
<i>...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.</i>

1017
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,356
<i>That was also when Warden Norton...</i>

1018
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:16,484
<i>...instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.</i>

1019
01:18:16,943 --> 01:18:19,028
<i>You may remember reading about it.</i>

1020
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:22,365
<i>It made the papers and got
his picture in</i> Look <i>magazine.</i>

1021
01:18:22,574 --> 01:18:23,908
It's no free ride...

1022
01:18:24,075 --> 01:18:27,287
...but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

1023
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,998
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

1024
01:18:30,331 --> 01:18:32,876
Our inmates, properly supervised...

1025
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,712
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

1026
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,007
...performing all manner
of public service.

1027
01:18:39,173 --> 01:18:41,968
These men can learn the value
of an honest day's labor...

1028
01:18:42,176 --> 01:18:45,972
...while providing a valuable service
to the community...

1029
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:50,894
...and at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

1030
01:18:51,311 --> 01:18:53,646
<i>Of course he didn't tell the press...</i>

1031
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:57,317
<i>...that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.</i>

1032
01:18:57,525 --> 01:19:00,570
<i>There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.</i>

1033
01:19:00,778 --> 01:19:03,281
<i>Men, materials, you name it.</i>

1034
01:19:03,615 --> 01:19:06,492
<i>And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!</i>

1035
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:09,245
-You'll put me out of business.
-Ned.

1036
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:13,875
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1037
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:17,420
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1038
01:19:17,629 --> 01:19:22,967
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed. Sam.

1039
01:19:23,968 --> 01:19:25,511
We go back a long way, Sam.

1040
01:19:26,804 --> 01:19:31,726
I need this new highway contract.
I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1041
01:19:32,644 --> 01:19:34,437
You have some of this fine pie...

1042
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:38,024
...my missus made especially for you.
You think about that.

1043
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,993
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1044
01:19:49,202 --> 01:19:52,288
It seems to me I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1045
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:57,335
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1046
01:19:58,419 --> 01:20:00,588
<i>And behind every shady deal...</i>

1047
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:03,549
<i>...behind every dollar earned...</i>

1048
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:06,886
<i>...there was Andy, keeping the books.</i>

1049
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,554
Two deposits.

1050
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:12,934
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1051
01:20:43,131 --> 01:20:47,468
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1052
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,847
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1053
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:53,016
-Yes, sir.
-How do I look?

1054
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:56,561
-Very nice.
-Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1055
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:58,271
-Governor will be there.
-Hmm.

1056
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:01,149
You want the rest of this?

1057
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:04,444
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1058
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:06,988
Thank you, sir.

1059
01:21:09,824 --> 01:21:13,077
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1060
01:21:13,286 --> 01:21:18,124
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1061
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:20,668
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1062
01:21:20,877 --> 01:21:24,714
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1063
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:26,674
That's where I come in.

1064
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,594
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1065
01:21:29,802 --> 01:21:32,638
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1066
01:21:32,972 --> 01:21:36,476
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1067
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:39,645
-Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
-Cleaner.

1068
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:43,858
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1069
01:21:46,194 --> 01:21:50,531
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1070
01:21:50,823 --> 01:21:53,493
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1071
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:56,746
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1072
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:58,956
Now anybody gets curious--

1073
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,542
FBI, IRS, whatever--

1074
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:03,294
--it'll lead to somebody.

1075
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:07,340
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1076
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:12,720
All right, who?

1077
01:22:12,887 --> 01:22:14,514
Randall Stevens.

1078
01:22:15,014 --> 01:22:16,015
Who?

1079
01:22:16,182 --> 01:22:18,184
The "silent" silent partner.

1080
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:21,479
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1081
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:23,856
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1082
01:22:24,023 --> 01:22:26,901
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1083
01:22:27,527 --> 01:22:28,736
But who is he?

1084
01:22:28,945 --> 01:22:32,907
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1085
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,201
I conjured him...

1086
01:22:35,368 --> 01:22:36,744
...out of thin air.

1087
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:40,289
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1088
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:45,711
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

1089
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,048
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1090
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:52,385
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1091
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,346
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1092
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:57,682
...driver's license, Social Security number.

1093
01:22:57,932 --> 01:22:58,933
You're shitting me.

1094
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:02,520
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1095
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:04,438
...a figment of my imagination.

1096
01:23:04,647 --> 01:23:06,649
Well, I'll be damned!

1097
01:23:07,984 --> 01:23:09,735
Did I say you were good?

1098
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:11,737
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1099
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,198
The funny thing is...

1100
01:23:14,407 --> 01:23:18,494
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1101
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:21,247
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1102
01:23:30,089 --> 01:23:31,424
Ever bother you?

1103
01:23:32,842 --> 01:23:35,928
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1104
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:38,181
A fine line, maybe...

1105
01:23:38,764 --> 01:23:40,808
...but I also built that library...

1106
01:23:41,017 --> 01:23:44,061
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1107
01:23:44,270 --> 01:23:46,480
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1108
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,900
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1109
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:50,568
Money instead of sheets.

1110
01:23:50,943 --> 01:23:53,487
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1111
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:13,424
<i>Tommy Williams came
to Shawshank in 1965...</i>

1112
01:24:13,633 --> 01:24:15,885
<i>...on a two-year stretch for B and E.</i>

1113
01:24:16,135 --> 01:24:18,471
<i>That's breaking and entering to you.</i>

1114
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:22,975
<i>Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.</i>

1115
01:24:23,392 --> 01:24:24,685
<i>Young punk.</i>

1116
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,520
<i>Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...</i>

1117
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,272
<i>...cocky as hell.</i>

1118
01:24:28,481 --> 01:24:30,858
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1119
01:24:31,108 --> 01:24:32,860
Making me look bad.

1120
01:24:33,069 --> 01:24:34,862
<i>We liked him immediately.</i>

1121
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:38,824
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1122
01:24:39,158 --> 01:24:42,787
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1123
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,373
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1124
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:50,044
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1125
01:24:50,253 --> 01:24:54,048
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I sure did.

1126
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:57,718
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1127
01:25:02,181 --> 01:25:04,850
Hey, you done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1128
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:08,980
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1129
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:11,190
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1130
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:13,150
Not like here.

1131
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:15,069
Sounds like you done time all over.

1132
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,905
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13.

1133
01:25:18,114 --> 01:25:20,324
You name it, chances are I've been there.

1134
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:23,202
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1135
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:26,205
What I mean is...

1136
01:25:26,539 --> 01:25:29,500
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1137
01:25:30,209 --> 01:25:33,421
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1138
01:25:33,838 --> 01:25:35,423
What are you in for?

1139
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:36,716
Me?

1140
01:25:39,135 --> 01:25:40,803
A lawyer fucked me.

1141
01:25:44,724 --> 01:25:47,685
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1142
01:25:55,568 --> 01:25:59,989
<i>As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.</i>

1143
01:26:00,573 --> 01:26:02,700
<i>Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...</i>

1144
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,411
<i>...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.</i>

1145
01:26:05,703 --> 01:26:07,079
<i>Whatever it was...</i>

1146
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,832
<i>...something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.</i>

1147
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:16,547
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1148
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:19,258
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1149
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:22,845
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1150
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:26,766
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1151
01:26:28,476 --> 01:26:30,311
-You mean that?
-Yeah.

1152
01:26:31,979 --> 01:26:33,439
You really mean that?

1153
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:35,816
Yes, sir, I do.

1154
01:26:36,025 --> 01:26:37,985
Good. Because if we do this...

1155
01:26:38,194 --> 01:26:42,156
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1156
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,200
Thing is, see...

1157
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:46,994
...I don't read so good.

1158
01:26:48,162 --> 01:26:49,288
"Well."

1159
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:53,000
You don't read...

1160
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,794
...so well.

1161
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,631
We'll get to that.

1162
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:05,179
<i>So Andy took Tommy
under his wing.</i>

1163
01:27:05,388 --> 01:27:08,015
<i>Started walking him through his ABC's.</i>

1164
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:12,353
<i>Tommy took to it pretty well too.</i>

1165
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:15,398
<i>Boy found brains he never knew he had.</i>

1166
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:21,153
<i>Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.</i>

1167
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:23,030
<i>He really liked the kid.</i>

1168
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:26,826
<i>Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.</i>

1169
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:29,578
<i>But that wasn't the only reason.</i>

1170
01:27:30,287 --> 01:27:32,498
<i>Prison time is slow time.</i>

1171
01:27:32,957 --> 01:27:35,543
<i>So you do what you can to keep going.</i>

1172
01:27:35,876 --> 01:27:37,962
<i>Some fellas collect stamps.</i>

1173
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,840
<i>Others build matchstick houses.</i>

1174
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:44,093
<i>Andy built a library.</i>

1175
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,512
<i>Now he needed a new project.</i>

1176
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:48,889
<i>Tommy was it.</i>

1177
01:27:49,515 --> 01:27:53,519
<i>It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.</i>

1178
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:57,314
<i>The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.</i>

1179
01:27:58,190 --> 01:27:59,483
<i>In prison...</i>

1180
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:03,487
<i>...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.</i>

1181
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:09,118
<i>By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...</i>

1182
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:11,537
<i>...it was lovely Raquel.</i>

1183
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,096
Time.

1184
01:28:35,144 --> 01:28:36,395
Well?

1185
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:39,899
Well, it's for shit.

1186
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:43,235
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1187
01:28:43,402 --> 01:28:44,904
It's probably not that bad.

1188
01:28:45,112 --> 01:28:49,366
Yeah, I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1189
01:28:49,575 --> 01:28:51,285
Let's see how the score comes out.

1190
01:28:51,494 --> 01:28:54,455
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1191
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:57,750
Two points, right there!

1192
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:59,543
There's your goddamn score!

1193
01:28:59,752 --> 01:29:03,464
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1194
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,050
Fuck this place!

1195
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:07,426
Fuck it!

1196
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:27,821
I feel bad.

1197
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:29,240
I let him down.

1198
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,158
That's crap, kid.

1199
01:29:31,367 --> 01:29:32,701
He's proud of you.

1200
01:29:33,035 --> 01:29:35,913
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1201
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,665
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1202
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:41,001
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1203
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,462
What's he in here for anyway?

1204
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:44,755
Murder.

1205
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:49,009
-The hell, you say.
-Hmm.

1206
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,054
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1207
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:57,393
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1208
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:06,777
What?

1209
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:10,322
About four years ago...

1210
01:30:10,573 --> 01:30:13,826
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1211
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:15,619
I stole a car.

1212
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:17,997
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1213
01:30:18,664 --> 01:30:20,874
About six months left to go...

1214
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:23,085
...I get a new cellmate in.

1215
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,421
Elmo Blatch.

1216
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,464
Big, twitchy fucker.

1217
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,844
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1218
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:34,763
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1219
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:37,308
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1220
01:30:37,516 --> 01:30:42,438
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1221
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:48,152
Talked all the time too.
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1222
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,987
Places he'd been in...

1223
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:53,365
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1224
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:55,784
Even people he killed.

1225
01:30:57,036 --> 01:30:59,830
People who "gave him shit."

1226
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,041
That's how he put it.

1227
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:06,712
So one night, like a joke...

1228
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:11,300
...I say to him,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1229
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:12,676
So he says:

1230
01:31:12,843 --> 01:31:16,805
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1231
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:21,393
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1232
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:25,481
So I pick out this guy...

1233
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:27,941
...go in one night...

1234
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:29,902
...and do his place.

1235
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:32,655
He wakes up...

1236
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,157
...and gives me shit.

1237
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:37,910
So I killed him.

1238
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:42,498
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1239
01:31:43,916 --> 01:31:46,168
And that's the best part.

1240
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:49,296
She's fucking this prick, see...

1241
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:52,591
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1242
01:31:53,175 --> 01:31:55,761
Some hotshot banker.

1243
01:31:57,179 --> 01:31:59,682
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1244
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:15,030
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1245
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,784
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1246
01:32:19,535 --> 01:32:20,536
Sir?

1247
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:26,333
Well, it's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1248
01:32:26,959 --> 01:32:30,879
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1249
01:32:31,088 --> 01:32:33,257
He's young, not terribly bright.

1250
01:32:33,799 --> 01:32:37,219
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1251
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:39,179
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1252
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:44,143
Well, let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1253
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:49,022
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1254
01:32:49,231 --> 01:32:51,942
Oh, and by the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1255
01:32:52,151 --> 01:32:55,028
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1256
01:32:55,154 --> 01:32:57,614
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1257
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:59,783
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1258
01:32:59,992 --> 01:33:04,580
They'd have his last known address,
names of relatives. It's a chance, isn't it?

1259
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:08,667
How can you be so obtuse?

1260
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:10,836
What?

1261
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:13,547
What did you call me?

1262
01:33:13,756 --> 01:33:15,507
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1263
01:33:15,841 --> 01:33:17,342
You're forgetting yourself.

1264
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,637
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1265
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:23,599
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1266
01:33:23,807 --> 01:33:26,518
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1267
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:29,313
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1268
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,107
Sir, if I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1269
01:33:32,733 --> 01:33:35,694
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1270
01:33:36,737 --> 01:33:40,532
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1271
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:42,367
Not in this office...

1272
01:33:42,576 --> 01:33:44,536
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1273
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:47,456
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1274
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,209
-Solitary. A month.
-Yes, sir.

1275
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:53,170
-What's the matter with you?
-Get him out of here.

1276
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,924
This is my chance to get out!
It's my life! Don't you understand?!

1277
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:59,218
Get him out!

1278
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,930
A month in the hole.

1279
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,849
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1280
01:34:06,058 --> 01:34:07,351
It's all my fault.

1281
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,144
Oh, bullshit.

1282
01:34:09,812 --> 01:34:12,523
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1283
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:15,108
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1284
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:17,361
I mean, for real innocent?

1285
01:34:17,569 --> 01:34:18,904
It looks that way.

1286
01:34:19,321 --> 01:34:21,240
Sweet Jesus.

1287
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:23,325
How long has he been here now?

1288
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:26,995
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1289
01:34:27,246 --> 01:34:29,832
-Williams, Thomas.
-Yeah, over here.

1290
01:34:35,671 --> 01:34:36,839
What you got?

1291
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:38,799
Board of Education.

1292
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,551
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1293
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:44,721
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1294
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:47,099
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1295
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,435
Hey, Skeet, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1296
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,604
Floyd, come on.

1297
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,942
Hey, Red.

1298
01:34:58,026 --> 01:35:00,445
Will you throw that away, please?

1299
01:35:06,034 --> 01:35:07,786
Well, shit.

1300
01:35:20,465 --> 01:35:23,260
The kid passed. C-plus average.

1301
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,554
Thought you'd like to know.

1302
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,238
Warden wants to talk.

1303
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:58,045
Out here?

1304
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:00,505
That's what the man said.

1305
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:20,067
-Warden?
-Tommy?

1306
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:31,703
Tommy, I'm asking you to keep
this conversation just between us.

1307
01:36:33,205 --> 01:36:35,457
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1308
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:55,978
We got a situation here.

1309
01:36:56,853 --> 01:36:58,939
I think you can appreciate that.

1310
01:36:59,147 --> 01:37:00,399
Yes, sir.

1311
01:37:00,649 --> 01:37:02,067
I sure can.

1312
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:06,363
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1313
01:37:07,823 --> 01:37:10,409
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1314
01:37:12,661 --> 01:37:14,496
The right thing to do...

1315
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:19,918
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1316
01:37:20,919 --> 01:37:22,337
Do you understand?

1317
01:37:24,631 --> 01:37:26,258
I need your help, son.

1318
01:37:27,676 --> 01:37:29,845
If I'm going to move on this...

1319
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:33,348
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1320
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:35,142
I have to know...

1321
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:37,978
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1322
01:37:38,186 --> 01:37:39,312
Yes, sir.

1323
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:40,772
Absolutely.

1324
01:37:41,273 --> 01:37:44,276
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1325
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:46,445
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1326
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:49,322
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1327
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:51,324
Just give me that chance.

1328
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,955
That's what I thought.

1329
01:38:44,002 --> 01:38:45,921
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1330
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:48,715
Terrible thing.

1331
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:51,802
A man that young...

1332
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:54,721
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1333
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,766
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1334
01:38:58,517 --> 01:39:00,018
Truly, it did.

1335
01:39:03,021 --> 01:39:05,440
We just have to put it behind us.

1336
01:39:07,109 --> 01:39:08,360
Move on.

1337
01:39:09,945 --> 01:39:11,446
I'm done.

1338
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:14,366
Everything stops.

1339
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,703
Get someone else to run your scams.

1340
01:39:19,955 --> 01:39:21,790
Nothing stops.

1341
01:39:23,125 --> 01:39:24,501
Nothing.

1342
01:39:27,712 --> 01:39:30,799
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1343
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:33,552
No more protection from the guards.

1344
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:38,640
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1345
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:42,477
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1346
01:39:43,895 --> 01:39:45,397
And the library?

1347
01:39:46,064 --> 01:39:47,065
Gone.

1348
01:39:47,649 --> 01:39:50,235
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1349
01:39:50,694 --> 01:39:53,363
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1350
01:39:53,572 --> 01:39:55,699
They'll see the flames for miles.

1351
01:39:55,907 --> 01:39:58,743
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1352
01:39:59,995 --> 01:40:02,998
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1353
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,587
Or am I being obtuse?

1354
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:23,018
Give him another month
to think about it.

1355
01:41:09,773 --> 01:41:12,817
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1356
01:41:13,652 --> 01:41:15,487
Like a closed book.

1357
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:18,323
Complained about it all the time.

1358
01:41:19,241 --> 01:41:20,825
She was beautiful.

1359
01:41:23,203 --> 01:41:25,038
God, I loved her.

1360
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:30,669
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1361
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:35,090
I killed her, Red.

1362
01:41:36,967 --> 01:41:38,760
I didn't pull the trigger...

1363
01:41:40,178 --> 01:41:41,930
...but I drove her away.

1364
01:41:43,431 --> 01:41:46,142
That's why she died, because of me...

1365
01:41:46,309 --> 01:41:47,686
...the way I am.

1366
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:58,530
That don't make you a murderer.

1367
01:42:01,908 --> 01:42:03,702
Bad husband, maybe.

1368
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:10,583
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1369
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:12,127
No, I didn't.

1370
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:14,462
Somebody else did.

1371
01:42:15,714 --> 01:42:17,799
And I wound up in here.

1372
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,886
Bad luck, I guess.

1373
01:42:24,764 --> 01:42:28,518
-Yeah.
-It floats around.

1374
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:31,771
It's got to land on somebody.

1375
01:42:32,689 --> 01:42:34,566
It was my turn, that's all.

1376
01:42:35,275 --> 01:42:38,069
I was in the path of the tornado.

1377
01:42:43,992 --> 01:42:47,954
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1378
01:42:52,292 --> 01:42:54,002
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1379
01:42:55,253 --> 01:42:56,671
Me?

1380
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:00,592
Yeah.

1381
01:43:01,593 --> 01:43:03,887
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1382
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:08,183
...and two or three marbles rolling
around upstairs, they'll let me out.

1383
01:43:09,267 --> 01:43:10,935
I tell you where I'd go.

1384
01:43:12,395 --> 01:43:14,105
Zihuatanejo.

1385
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:16,107
Say what?

1386
01:43:16,441 --> 01:43:18,276
Zihuatanejo.

1387
01:43:19,194 --> 01:43:20,862
It's in Mexico.

1388
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:24,366
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1389
01:43:25,492 --> 01:43:28,286
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1390
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:32,123
-No.
-They say it has no memory.

1391
01:43:34,084 --> 01:43:36,753
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1392
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,882
A warm place with no memory.

1393
01:43:44,135 --> 01:43:46,054
Open up a little hotel...

1394
01:43:47,764 --> 01:43:49,265
...right on the beach.

1395
01:43:49,849 --> 01:43:52,060
Buy some worthless old boat...

1396
01:43:52,602 --> 01:43:54,229
...and fix it up new.

1397
01:43:56,981 --> 01:43:58,191
Take my guests out...

1398
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:00,402
...charter fishing.

1399
01:44:04,239 --> 01:44:05,990
Zihuatanejo.

1400
01:44:09,494 --> 01:44:13,373
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1401
01:44:19,921 --> 01:44:22,757
I don't think I could make it
on the outside, Andy.

1402
01:44:29,431 --> 01:44:31,516
I been in here most of my life.

1403
01:44:32,934 --> 01:44:34,686
I'm an institutional man now.

1404
01:44:35,603 --> 01:44:37,355
Just like Brooks was.

1405
01:44:37,981 --> 01:44:40,525
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1406
01:44:41,067 --> 01:44:42,694
I don't think so.

1407
01:44:46,531 --> 01:44:50,452
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1408
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:53,746
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1409
01:44:53,955 --> 01:44:56,207
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1410
01:44:58,334 --> 01:44:59,961
Pacific Ocean?

1411
01:45:00,378 --> 01:45:01,588
Shit.

1412
01:45:01,963 --> 01:45:04,174
Scare me to death, something that big.

1413
01:45:04,382 --> 01:45:05,675
Not me.

1414
01:45:06,885 --> 01:45:09,637
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1415
01:45:11,389 --> 01:45:14,601
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1416
01:45:15,643 --> 01:45:17,145
That hotel, that boat...

1417
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:21,149
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1418
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:28,490
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1419
01:45:28,698 --> 01:45:30,742
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1420
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:33,620
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1421
01:45:33,828 --> 01:45:35,413
...and that's the way it is.

1422
01:45:35,747 --> 01:45:38,583
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1423
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:42,462
It's down there and I'm in here.

1424
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:47,759
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1425
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:52,180
Get busy living...

1426
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,600
...or get busy dying.

1427
01:45:59,229 --> 01:46:00,939
Andy.

1428
01:46:04,025 --> 01:46:05,693
Red?

1429
01:46:07,695 --> 01:46:10,448
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1430
01:46:10,615 --> 01:46:12,909
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1431
01:46:14,786 --> 01:46:18,623
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1432
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:23,253
-A lot of hayfields up there.
-One in particular.

1433
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:27,382
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1434
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:30,468
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1435
01:46:31,386 --> 01:46:33,888
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1436
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,392
We went there for a picnic...

1437
01:46:37,809 --> 01:46:39,894
...and made love under that oak...

1438
01:46:40,562 --> 01:46:42,814
...and I asked and she said yes.

1439
01:46:46,818 --> 01:46:48,653
Promise me, Red.

1440
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:51,114
If you ever get out...

1441
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:52,824
...find that spot.

1442
01:46:53,992 --> 01:46:58,830
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1443
01:46:59,956 --> 01:47:03,001
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1444
01:47:05,670 --> 01:47:08,339
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1445
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,341
What, Andy?

1446
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:12,510
What's buried under there?

1447
01:47:14,095 --> 01:47:15,972
You'll have to pry it up...

1448
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:17,432
...to see.

1449
01:47:23,438 --> 01:47:25,273
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1450
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,692
He's talking funny.

1451
01:47:28,776 --> 01:47:30,486
I'm really worried about him.

1452
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:32,322
Let's keep an eye on him.

1453
01:47:32,530 --> 01:47:35,783
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1454
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:38,369
Oh, Lord.

1455
01:47:39,704 --> 01:47:41,289
What?

1456
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:44,792
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1457
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:47,086
He asked me for a length of rope.

1458
01:47:47,295 --> 01:47:50,006
-Rope?
-Six feet long.

1459
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:51,591
And you gave it to him.

1460
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:54,260
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1461
01:47:54,469 --> 01:47:56,054
Jesus! Heywood.

1462
01:47:56,638 --> 01:47:58,598
How was I supposed to know?

1463
01:47:58,806 --> 01:48:00,391
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1464
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:04,312
No. Andy would never do that.

1465
01:48:04,896 --> 01:48:06,356
Never.

1466
01:48:08,066 --> 01:48:09,400
I don't know.

1467
01:48:12,236 --> 01:48:14,238
Every man has his breaking point.

1468
01:48:16,574 --> 01:48:18,868
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1469
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:20,912
Just about finished, sir.

1470
01:48:38,054 --> 01:48:39,681
Three deposits tonight.

1471
01:48:47,647 --> 01:48:49,565
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1472
01:48:49,774 --> 01:48:51,401
And shine my shoes.

1473
01:48:51,609 --> 01:48:54,529
-I want them looking like mirrors.
-Yes, sir.

1474
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:01,494
It's good having you back, Andy.

1475
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:04,288
Place wasn't the same without you.

1476
01:49:51,169 --> 01:49:52,545
Lights out!

1477
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:27,622
<i>I've had some long nights
in the stir.</i>

1478
01:50:28,164 --> 01:50:30,833
<i>Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...</i>

1479
01:50:31,042 --> 01:50:33,711
<i>...time can draw out like a blade.</i>

1480
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:42,053
<i>That was the longest night of my life.</i>

1481
01:50:57,902 --> 01:50:59,070
Give me a count!

1482
01:51:03,574 --> 01:51:06,410
Tier 3 south, clear!

1483
01:51:09,539 --> 01:51:12,708
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1484
01:51:12,917 --> 01:51:13,960
Dufresne!

1485
01:51:14,502 --> 01:51:16,921
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1486
01:51:20,091 --> 01:51:23,469
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1487
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:34,897
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1488
01:51:35,106 --> 01:51:38,401
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1489
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:39,944
You hear me?

1490
01:51:46,033 --> 01:51:48,119
Oh, my Holy God.

1491
01:52:05,136 --> 01:52:07,680
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1492
01:52:08,139 --> 01:52:10,683
-Start with that friend of his.
-Who?

1493
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:12,268
Him.

1494
01:52:13,269 --> 01:52:14,812
Open 237.

1495
01:52:18,316 --> 01:52:21,986
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1496
01:52:22,862 --> 01:52:25,448
-Don't say that to me again.
-But, sir, he wasn't.

1497
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:29,160
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

1498
01:52:29,827 --> 01:52:31,412
Is that what you're saying?

1499
01:52:31,579 --> 01:52:34,081
-Am I blind, Haig?
-No, sir!

1500
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:37,501
What about you. You blind?

1501
01:52:38,002 --> 01:52:40,338
-Tell me what this is.
-Last night's count.

1502
01:52:40,504 --> 01:52:44,050
Uh-huh. You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1503
01:52:44,258 --> 01:52:45,593
"Dufresne."

1504
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:50,014
He was in his cell at lights out.

1505
01:52:50,181 --> 01:52:53,100
Stands to reason he'd still be here
in the morning.

1506
01:52:53,434 --> 01:52:55,061
I want him found.

1507
01:52:55,269 --> 01:52:58,731
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1508
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:00,191
Yes, sir.

1509
01:53:01,192 --> 01:53:04,987
Let's go. Move your butts. Move it!

1510
01:53:06,864 --> 01:53:07,865
Stand.

1511
01:53:09,283 --> 01:53:10,701
Well?

1512
01:53:13,788 --> 01:53:14,830
Well, what?

1513
01:53:14,997 --> 01:53:18,459
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1514
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,045
He must have said something.

1515
01:53:21,754 --> 01:53:24,674
No, sir, warden. Not a word.

1516
01:53:26,467 --> 01:53:29,053
Lord, it's a miracle!

1517
01:53:29,637 --> 01:53:32,223
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1518
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:34,058
Nothing left...

1519
01:53:34,892 --> 01:53:37,603
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1520
01:53:37,812 --> 01:53:40,564
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1521
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:42,066
Maybe she knows.

1522
01:53:42,233 --> 01:53:45,444
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1523
01:53:45,778 --> 01:53:48,239
Oh, guess not.

1524
01:53:48,781 --> 01:53:50,992
Why should she be any different?

1525
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:53,744
This is a conspiracy.

1526
01:53:54,370 --> 01:53:56,080
That's what this is.

1527
01:53:56,789 --> 01:54:00,543
One big, damn conspiracy!

1528
01:54:00,793 --> 01:54:02,795
And everyone's in on it!

1529
01:54:03,421 --> 01:54:04,588
Including her!

1530
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:41,333
<i>In 1966...</i>

1531
01:54:41,542 --> 01:54:43,961
<i>...Andy Dufresne escaped...</i>

1532
01:54:44,128 --> 01:54:45,713
<i>...from Shawshank Prison.</i>

1533
01:54:47,965 --> 01:54:50,509
<i>All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes...</i>

1534
01:54:51,135 --> 01:54:52,678
<i>...a bar of soap...</i>

1535
01:54:52,887 --> 01:54:54,472
<i>...and an old rock hammer...</i>

1536
01:54:54,638 --> 01:54:57,141
<i>...damn near worn down to the nub.</i>

1537
01:55:01,645 --> 01:55:06,400
<i>I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.</i>

1538
01:55:07,026 --> 01:55:09,653
<i>Old Andy did it in less than 20.</i>

1539
01:55:27,963 --> 01:55:30,257
<i>Oh, Andy loved geology.</i>

1540
01:55:31,008 --> 01:55:34,178
<i>I imagine it appealed to
his meticulous nature.</i>

1541
01:55:34,595 --> 01:55:36,430
<i>An ice age here...</i>

1542
01:55:36,847 --> 01:55:39,350
<i>...million years
of mountain-building there.</i>

1543
01:55:40,351 --> 01:55:43,187
<i>Geology is the study
of pressure and time.</i>

1544
01:55:44,021 --> 01:55:46,023
<i>That's all it takes, really.</i>

1545
01:55:46,774 --> 01:55:48,067
<i>Pressure...</i>

1546
01:55:48,526 --> 01:55:50,027
<i>...and time.</i>

1547
01:55:51,112 --> 01:55:53,197
<i>That and a big goddamn poster.</i>

1548
01:55:56,992 --> 01:55:58,160
<i>Like I said...</i>

1549
01:55:58,661 --> 01:56:02,665
<i>...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.</i>

1550
01:56:05,459 --> 01:56:10,256
<i>Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...</i>

1551
01:56:10,798 --> 01:56:12,716
<i>...a handful at a time.</i>

1552
01:56:14,051 --> 01:56:16,095
<i>I guess after Tommy was killed...</i>

1553
01:56:16,303 --> 01:56:19,265
<i>...Andy decided
he'd been here just about long enough.</i>

1554
01:56:19,473 --> 01:56:22,059
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1555
01:56:22,768 --> 01:56:24,812
I'm just about finished, sir.

1556
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:48,210
Three deposits tonight.

1557
01:56:55,509 --> 01:56:57,803
<i>Andy did like he was told.</i>

1558
01:56:58,012 --> 01:57:01,515
<i>Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.</i>

1559
01:57:05,186 --> 01:57:07,479
<i>The guards simply didn't notice.</i>

1560
01:57:07,771 --> 01:57:09,273
<i>Neither did I.</i>

1561
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:10,983
<i>I mean, seriously...</i>

1562
01:57:11,192 --> 01:57:14,195
<i>...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?</i>

1563
01:59:17,735 --> 01:59:20,904
<i>Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...</i>

1564
01:59:21,155 --> 01:59:24,491
<i>...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.</i>

1565
01:59:25,492 --> 01:59:27,828
<i>Or maybe I just don't want to.</i>

1566
01:59:32,249 --> 01:59:34,585
<i>Five hundred yards.</i>

1567
01:59:35,085 --> 01:59:38,172
<i>That's the length
of five football fields.</i>

1568
01:59:38,797 --> 01:59:41,383
<i>Just shy of half a mile.</i>

1569
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:41,193
<i>The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret...</i>

1570
02:00:41,485 --> 02:00:44,321
<i>...a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...</i>

1571
02:00:44,571 --> 02:00:47,157
<i>...strolled into
the Maine National Bank.</i>

1572
02:00:47,741 --> 02:00:50,911
<i>Until that moment, he didn't exist.</i>

1573
02:00:51,495 --> 02:00:53,831
<i>-Except on paper.</i>
-May I help you?

1574
02:00:54,248 --> 02:00:56,166
<i>He had all the proper ID--</i>

1575
02:00:56,375 --> 02:01:00,087
<i>Driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card--</i>

1576
02:01:00,504 --> 02:01:03,048
<i>--and the signature
was a spot-on match.</i>

1577
02:01:03,257 --> 02:01:06,343
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1578
02:01:06,552 --> 02:01:08,303
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1579
02:01:09,096 --> 02:01:10,681
Thank you.

1580
02:01:10,848 --> 02:01:12,015
I'm sure I will.

1581
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:16,270
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1582
02:01:16,478 --> 02:01:17,479
Please.

1583
02:01:18,021 --> 02:01:20,524
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1584
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:22,568
I'd be happy to.

1585
02:01:24,027 --> 02:01:25,362
Good day, sir.

1586
02:01:26,321 --> 02:01:30,742
<i>Mr. Stevens visited nearly
a dozen banks in the Portland area.</i>

1587
02:01:31,201 --> 02:01:32,828
<i>All told, he blew town...</i>

1588
02:01:33,036 --> 02:01:37,875
<i>...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.</i>

1589
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:41,336
<i>Severance pay for 19 years.</i>

1590
02:01:48,552 --> 02:01:50,762
Good morning,
<i>Portland Daily Bugle.</i>

1591
02:02:43,607 --> 02:02:46,568
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1592
02:02:46,818 --> 02:02:51,281
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1593
02:02:51,698 --> 02:02:56,161
<i>I wasn't there to see it, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a little girl...</i>

1594
02:02:56,370 --> 02:02:57,871
<i>...when they took him away.</i>

1595
02:03:03,752 --> 02:03:07,130
<i>Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.</i>

1596
02:03:23,105 --> 02:03:24,481
Samuel Norton.

1597
02:03:24,648 --> 02:03:26,650
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Open up.

1598
02:03:30,279 --> 02:03:33,282
Norton. Open the door.

1599
02:03:33,448 --> 02:03:34,700
I'm not sure which key.

1600
02:03:37,494 --> 02:03:39,413
Norton!

1601
02:03:44,835 --> 02:03:46,795
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1602
02:03:58,307 --> 02:04:01,768
<i>I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...</i>

1603
02:04:01,977 --> 02:04:03,562
<i>...other than that bullet...</i>

1604
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:08,191
<i>...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.</i>

1605
02:04:10,694 --> 02:04:14,197
<i>Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...</i>

1606
02:04:14,448 --> 02:04:16,533
<i>...I got a postcard in the mail.</i>

1607
02:04:17,993 --> 02:04:20,829
<i>It was blank, but the postmark said...</i>

1608
02:04:21,038 --> 02:04:23,165
<i>...Fort Hancock, Texas.</i>

1609
02:04:23,707 --> 02:04:25,042
<i>Fort Hancock...</i>

1610
02:04:25,334 --> 02:04:27,044
<i>...right on the border.</i>

1611
02:04:27,461 --> 02:04:29,463
<i>That's where Andy crossed.</i>

1612
02:04:30,047 --> 02:04:34,176
<i>When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...</i>

1613
02:04:34,509 --> 02:04:36,720
<i>...it always makes me laugh.</i>

1614
02:04:38,555 --> 02:04:40,140
<i>Andy Dufresne...</i>

1615
02:04:40,515 --> 02:04:42,559
<i>...who crawled through
a river of shit...</i>

1616
02:04:42,726 --> 02:04:45,145
<i>...and came out clean
on the other side.</i>

1617
02:04:45,979 --> 02:04:47,356
<i>Andy Dufresne...</i>

1618
02:04:48,148 --> 02:04:49,733
<i>...headed for the Pacific.</i>

1619
02:04:52,736 --> 02:04:54,905
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1620
02:04:55,072 --> 02:04:58,909
He says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1621
02:04:59,076 --> 02:05:01,953
<i>Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.</i>

1622
02:05:02,621 --> 02:05:04,331
<i>I swear, the stuff he pulled...</i>

1623
02:05:04,539 --> 02:05:07,501
"My friends could use a couple of beers."

1624
02:05:07,834 --> 02:05:09,503
And he got it!

1625
02:05:10,754 --> 02:05:13,131
<i>Sometimes it makes me sad,
though...</i>

1626
02:05:13,423 --> 02:05:14,841
<i>...Andy being gone.</i>

1627
02:05:15,550 --> 02:05:19,680
<i>I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.</i>

1628
02:05:20,138 --> 02:05:22,224
<i>Their feathers are just too bright.</i>

1629
02:05:23,934 --> 02:05:25,644
<i>And when they fly away...</i>

1630
02:05:26,103 --> 02:05:30,482
<i>...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.</i>

1631
02:05:31,566 --> 02:05:32,818
<i>But still...</i>

1632
02:05:33,276 --> 02:05:37,614
<i>...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.</i>

1633
02:05:41,827 --> 02:05:44,204
<i>I guess I just miss my friend.</i>

1634
02:06:08,645 --> 02:06:09,813
Please sit down.

1635
02:06:15,652 --> 02:06:17,237
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1636
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:21,032
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1637
02:06:21,825 --> 02:06:23,994
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1638
02:06:25,829 --> 02:06:27,414
Rehabilitated?

1639
02:06:29,458 --> 02:06:31,334
Well, now, let me see.

1640
02:06:32,335 --> 02:06:34,671
I don't have any idea what that means.

1641
02:06:36,798 --> 02:06:39,050
It means you're ready
to rejoin society--

1642
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:41,970
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1643
02:06:44,139 --> 02:06:46,141
To me it's just a made-up word.

1644
02:06:47,476 --> 02:06:49,811
A politician's word so that...

1645
02:06:50,228 --> 02:06:53,774
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1646
02:06:54,232 --> 02:06:55,859
...and have a job.

1647
02:06:57,819 --> 02:06:59,905
What do you really want to know?

1648
02:07:00,697 --> 02:07:02,657
Am I sorry for what I did?

1649
02:07:03,074 --> 02:07:04,367
Well, are you?

1650
02:07:06,161 --> 02:07:08,997
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1651
02:07:10,373 --> 02:07:13,835
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1652
02:07:17,297 --> 02:07:19,883
I look back on the way I was then...

1653
02:07:22,010 --> 02:07:23,345
...a young...

1654
02:07:24,262 --> 02:07:27,766
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1655
02:07:30,769 --> 02:07:32,479
I want to talk to him.

1656
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:36,900
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1657
02:07:37,609 --> 02:07:39,569
Tell him the way things are.

1658
02:07:41,655 --> 02:07:43,073
But I can't.

1659
02:07:45,283 --> 02:07:47,285
That kid's long gone...

1660
02:07:48,495 --> 02:07:51,248
...and this old man is all that's left.

1661
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:54,125
I got to live with that.

1662
02:07:55,502 --> 02:07:57,212
Rehabilitated?

1663
02:07:57,587 --> 02:07:59,422
It's just a bullshit word.

1664
02:08:00,340 --> 02:08:05,095
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1665
02:08:06,346 --> 02:08:08,598
Because to tell you the truth...

1666
02:08:08,932 --> 02:08:10,934
...I don't give a shit.

1667
02:09:37,479 --> 02:09:38,855
Here you go, miss.

1668
02:09:41,816 --> 02:09:42,859
Restroom break, boss?

1669
02:09:48,657 --> 02:09:53,203
You don't need to ask me every time you
need to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1670
02:09:54,204 --> 02:09:55,830
Yes, sir.

1671
02:10:06,216 --> 02:10:09,302
<i>Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.</i>

1672
02:10:10,136 --> 02:10:13,139
<i>I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.</i>

1673
02:10:16,643 --> 02:10:18,812
<i>There's a harsh truth to face.</i>

1674
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:23,400
<i>No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.</i>

1675
02:10:31,241 --> 02:10:34,953
<i>All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...</i>

1676
02:10:35,745 --> 02:10:38,248
<i>...so maybe they'd send me back.</i>

1677
02:10:43,420 --> 02:10:45,880
<i>Terrible thing, to live in fear.</i>

1678
02:10:46,756 --> 02:10:48,425
<i>Brooks Hatlen knew it.</i>

1679
02:10:48,633 --> 02:10:50,593
<i>Knew it all too well.</i>

1680
02:10:52,178 --> 02:10:55,598
<i>All I want is to be back
where things make sense.</i>

1681
02:10:56,016 --> 02:10:58,768
<i>Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.</i>

1682
02:11:00,770 --> 02:11:03,106
<i>Only one thing stops me.</i>

1683
02:11:04,566 --> 02:11:06,943
<i>A promise I made to Andy.</i>

1684
02:11:27,464 --> 02:11:28,798
There it is.

1685
02:11:39,225 --> 02:11:40,894
Much obliged, sir.

1686
02:15:20,196 --> 02:15:21,489
<i>Dear Red:</i>

1687
02:15:21,698 --> 02:15:24,200
<i>If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...</i>

1688
02:15:24,367 --> 02:15:28,538
<i>...and if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.</i>

1689
02:15:28,705 --> 02:15:31,207
<i>You remember the name
of the town, don't you?</i>

1690
02:15:33,501 --> 02:15:35,003
Zihuatanejo.

1691
02:15:36,629 --> 02:15:40,216
<i>I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.</i>

1692
02:15:40,717 --> 02:15:44,262
<i>I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.</i>

1693
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:46,472
<i>Remember, Red...</i>

1694
02:15:46,806 --> 02:15:48,891
<i>...hope is a good thing...</i>

1695
02:15:49,100 --> 02:15:51,102
<i>...maybe the best of things.</i>

1696
02:15:51,311 --> 02:15:53,479
<i>And no good thing ever dies.</i>

1697
02:15:54,022 --> 02:15:56,899
<i>I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...</i>

1698
02:15:57,066 --> 02:15:58,818
<i>...and finds you well.</i>

1699
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:00,570
<i>Your friend...</i>

1700
02:16:00,737 --> 02:16:01,904
<i>...Andy.</i>

1701
02:16:35,772 --> 02:16:37,482
<i>"Get busy living...</i>

1702
02:16:37,690 --> 02:16:39,609
<i>...or get busy dying."</i>

1703
02:16:42,278 --> 02:16:44,447
<i>That's goddamn right.</i>

1704
02:16:49,702 --> 02:16:51,829
<i>For the second time in my life...</i>

1705
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:54,624
<i>...I'm guilty of committing a crime.</i>

1706
02:16:55,708 --> 02:16:57,627
<i>Parole violation.</i>

1707
02:16:58,294 --> 02:17:01,964
<i>Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.</i>

1708
02:17:02,632 --> 02:17:04,675
<i>Not for an old crook like me.</i>

1709
02:17:04,884 --> 02:17:06,928
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

02:17:10,598 --> 02:17:15,311
<i>I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.</i>

1711
02:17:15,770 --> 02:17:19,107
<i>I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.</i>

1712
02:17:19,315 --> 02:17:21,818
<i>A free man at the start
of a long journey...</i>

1713
02:17:21,984 --> 02:17:24,612
<i>...whose conclusion is uncertain.</i>

1714
02:17:27,615 --> 02:17:30,284
<i>I hope I can make it across the border.</i>

1715
02:17:31,786 --> 02:17:34,831
<i>I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.</i>

1716
02:17:36,666 --> 02:17:40,753
<i>I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.</i>

1717
02:17:42,588 --> 02:17:43,798
<i>I hope.</i>
