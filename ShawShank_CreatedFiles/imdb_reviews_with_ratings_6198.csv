Review,Rating
"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.",10
"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.

How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.

Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.

But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",10
"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",10
The best movie in history and the best ending in any entertainment business,10
"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",10
"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.

This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.

King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.

What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",10
"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.

Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",10
"Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!",10
"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!",10
"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",9
"There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you simply watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart.",10
"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.

The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.

By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.

While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.

With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.

With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.

This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.

This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!",10

--------------The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!--------------

If you have never seen SHAWSHANK, this review is aimed, primarily, at you. I suppose there must be some of you out there!... What is quite difficult to fathom is that anyone with any REAL interest in Cinema could have managed to avoid seeing it for the 20+ years since its release!

In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote In every area of human activity, there is always that ""2%""! SHAWSHANK is no exception. Precisely 2% of voters rated SHAWSHANK 1 Star! ....I invite you to check!

In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White ""BRO-mance"" Yet, uniquely, Morgan Freeman's character, ""Red"", is anything but the ""predestined to an untimely end"" sidekick!... The entire film is literally narrated from Red's perspective. If anything, Red's ""Main-Man"" prison status gives him a bit of a dominant role in their relationship. But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS!

I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw-dropping...but in a negative sense: Opening Weekend-A starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U. S.! Overall...1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in!

My initial interest was piqued by a theatrical trailer, but I had to go by myself!!! My wife, who is a rather avid moviegoer, said...""H-m-m-m-m, a prison drama?....What's the Title?"" After hearing it, she responded, ""The SHAW- What? No, Thanks!... I PASS!"" Well, needless to say, after a first viewing, my awe was complete and unmitigated...so I insisted on dragging her along just days later, for my second viewing. My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites and have seen it numerous times! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife not going to see it in 1994!

I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's! Wonder what the Academy's members take on this would be today? Just look at the 7 categories where it was nominated!... Each one is exquisitely superb! Not a single Golden Statuette...WOW!!!!!!!

As far as Suspension of Disbelief is concerned, in the self-contained and totally insulated prison environment, it isn't much of a stretch to imagine an Old-Testament thumping warden anointing himself with almost god-like powers! Stranger things have happened, yes? In one odd twist, when one thinks of Illegal Immigration, Mexico, or Central America, to the USA, invariably, is the route that comes to mind...not the opposite, right!?!?!?

Despite having seen SHAWSHANK at least 15 times, it never ceases to mesmerize me. My only real critique: I think Andy would have to have been a magician to do what he did at the end, at least, so seamlessly!!! Can't go into any more detail without treading into SP**LER territory, so you'll just have to figure it out for yourself! SHAWSHANK is truly a film for the ages!

10********** STARS.... ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA!

Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!",10
"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor  Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!",10
"This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.",10
"It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.",10
"Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.

When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.

The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.

I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion.

The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.

Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.",10
"not for a reason. but for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. a film who reminds more than presents. values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. short - a film who must see !",10
"This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison. This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph. Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me. Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity. It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie. It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about. And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art. This is what movies were meant to be.",10
"Superbly played film set in 1946 , a bright young New England banker is convicted of the slayings of his spouse and her lover and sentenced to life at a strict State Prison . Introspective and quite Andy (Tim Robbins) gradually befriends inmates and over the next 2 decades wins the trust of prisoners and wardens but in his heart he still yearns for freedom . There he forms a peculiar friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison fixer , he experiences the brutality of prison life with a sadistic head guard (Clancy Brown), and is also mistreated and raped ; however , he adapts himself and offers financial advice to the guards and the selfish governor (Bob Gunton) , all in a shot 19 years. As two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding peace and redemption through acts of common help , friendship and decency . But when the proof of Andy's innocence is ripped away by those who need his services ,we learn that all is not quite what it seems at this State Penitentary , provoking a few susprises in the last two reels .

This is a very good and serious prison movie with thrills , emotion , exciting scenes , colour-blind relationships , hardnut camaraderie , gang opression , and violent disavowal of any homosexual implications . Prison buffs will find a lot of incidents to relish and the great spiritual resolution takes some swallowing and unexpected surprises . Adapted from the novella ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank redemption¨ ; the twist here is the upright starring is exceptionally bright , as his ability with accountancy leads to his handling the finances of everyone , from the humblest guard to the prison boss . Wonderful spectacle in watching time-passer while changing the bombshell actresses of the history : Rita Hayworth , Marilyn Monroe , Raquel Welch . US prison films have been making solid fares for more than sixty years and apart from slowness of pace in the second half , this one is well up to prison standards . This Frank Darabont's theatrical debut turns out to be a throwback rendition to the kind of literate , thought-provoking prison drama Hollywood used to make , such as : I am a fugitive from a chain gang , Birdman of Alcatraz and Escape from Alcatraz .

Tim Robbins plays magnificently Andy , an inmate finding solace and eventual redemption , Tim provides his usual talent for playing ambiguous roles , as his notable skills are put to good use. Along with Robbins' best screen acting there are various Oscar-worthy supporting characters with special mention for Morgan Freeman as the good fixer who brings his ordinary grace to what could have been a thankless role , the veteran James Withmore as the crow-keeping librarian , the sympathetic newcomer inmate Gil Bellows ,William Sadler , Mark Rolston and the ruthless guardian Clancy Brown and , of course , the egoistic and nasty governor excellently played by Bob Gunton .

It contains a colorful and evocative cinematography by Roger Deakins . And an enjoyable and really feeling musical score by Thomas Newman . In his engrossing direction debut ,Darabont avoids boring by fleeing most prison movie cliches . It results to be a pleasure of discovering a first-time filmmaker with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience , giving sensitive scenes , and brave enough to let roles details accumulate without recourse the excessively maudlin and over-sentimentality. It is a true masterpiece , being marvelously acted and perfectly paced.",8
"This is the sole film in the world that is over 2 hours and yet I wanted another 2. The story, the acting, the sense of justice, the acting, the triumph of good but not in a linear manner, the acting and certainly the authentic feel of the era make this a justified masterpiece.

Hollywood has lost the ability to make good films nowadays.

Keep churning out the stand up comic Thor, Hollywood.",10
"It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's ""a man who knows how to get things."" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format.",10
"The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was. What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a ""prison movie"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat! All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast! I promise you that you won't be sorry!!!",10
"Like many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés and stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens; and upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers, rapists and the like.

Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its magnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.

Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while. ""When your're feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!"" Raising my vote from 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.)",10
"*******MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**********

The story begins with the court case of Andy dufresne for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover (the first few minutes at the start captivate you from the beginning)Andy is wrongly convicted and sent to Shawshank maximum security prison set with a double life sentence.Andy finds a new companion called Red(Morgan Freeman) the man who can get things for anyone in the prison for the right price.

As a person that can get things or has been known to locate things from time to time for somebody Red doesn't find it particularly odd that andy asks him if he can get him Rita Hayworth in 1949.Of course he accepts.

The line that defines this great piece of cinema is ""get busy living or get busy dying"".This movie is without a doubt one of my favourites and remember always- FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE!",10
"What would you do, if the world came down on you, wrongly sentenced for a crime, that will take all your life's time; you're quite gentle and quite shy, don't feel the need to shout or cry, so you take it on the chin, accept the view, and settle in.

Then distractions take their toll, incarceration's in control, prison guards dealing in pain, fellow cons who can't refrain; new friends help, you're not alone, surrounded by these walls of stone, movie pinups play their part, to lift spirits and keep good heart.

Soon the governor fills his tills, make's the most of all your skills, he's an unforgiving kind, but there's money to be mined; you disperse what you collect, keeping covered all aspects, knowing channels have been primed, and overwhelmingly begrimed.

Perpetually entertaining stuff.",10
This for me and many other people is the greatest movie of all time it has amazing directing it has amazing acting by Tim Robinson and Morgan freeman whoever says that they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again overall the greatest movie of all time.,10
The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling. The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it. Breathtaking!,10
"I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life",10
"At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.",10
I have never watched a better movie than this before,9
"This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. ""One of the best movies ever"", my best friend said, ""My favorite movie in the whole wide world"", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.",9
"Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.

But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.

The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of ""Red"" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.

Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.

Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.

Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.

There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jailhouse. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.

On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended.",10
"""Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM""

Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""

My Rating - 10/10",10
"i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.",10
"One of the best movies ever made. Simple as that. Top 20 ever, and top 3 of the 90s. The ending is just so powerful.",10
"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie. Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen. Others are action junkies. Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle. For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.

At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people. That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly. It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray. But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done. And THAT is filmmaking at its finest. Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled.",10
"WHAT. A. MOVIE

It is just so well acted. You believe it all and want more of every single character!

Clever, moralistic and entertaining.

Hollywood has done very few consequential movies since (V For Vendetta, Captain Fantastic and perhaps Watchmen..) so grab this one if you have not watched it.",10
"I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time. That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out. Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased. There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank. Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this. Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance. If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.",9
"The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (""Shawshank"" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.

The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.

There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Brubaker"" and the more recent ""The Last Castle"". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, ""The Green Mile"", based, like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.

The word ""prison"", from the French ""pris"" (""taken""), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as ""penitentiary"" or ""reformatory"" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.

Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the ""fixer"" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.

The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted ""The Godfather"" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. ""Shawshank"" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his ""rickshaw"" film was going) and ""redemption"", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word ""redemption"" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10",9
"Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)",10
"Over the years many IMDb users have wondered why ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was ranked so high, and many ""wished"" that in time it would sink to a lower, more appropriate slot. Many analyses missed the mark. Following is my take on the real reason it is ranked so high, and why it will never sink much, if any. And I hope it never does.

This film deals with several ""hot"" buttons in us. A cheating spouse. A husband wrongly convicted and sent to prison. Corrupt law enforcement. A prison where inmates get maimed or killed. A smart inmate who plots a brilliant escape. The corrupt warden getting his just reward. Two friends being re-united with a good life ahead of them. Combined with a good script and good cinematography. What's not to like about this story?

I have seen this movie a number of times. Each time I get something new out of it that I either didn't see before, or had not made a mental connection to. I recently (year 2014) upgraded my personal copy from DVD to Blu-Ray and both the picture and sound are better.

This film continues to spark the occasional argument of whether it really should be rated on IMDb as the top film of all time. I don't know exactly where ""Shawshank Redemption"" should rank on the all-time list. That is akin to comparing home run hitters or golfers from different centuries. The games are quite different, as is true in cinema. I gave this film a ""10"", and on my list it is in one of the best movies of all time, along with a number of others. At the same time, I recognize that everyone else has their own opinion. I don't really see any value in trying to decide a rank order for all time. Each film should be appreciated for what it has to offer, no more, and no less.

And this one offers a lot.",10
"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) **** Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton,Clancy Brown, William Sadler, James Whitmore, Gil Bellows. Excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" with falsely accused of murdering his wife Robbins facing hard time in a corrupt prison and a solid friend (Freeman in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance of stoicism). Great acting and above the preconceived ""prison film"" genre that also breaks away from the cliché of the human spirit yet enables its elements. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Screenplay Adaptation and Director.",10
"This film is easily in my top three favorite films. I return to it time and time again, still captivated! Bravo to everyone involved in this timeless production.",10
"Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever.

The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is ""Red,"" a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate who's made ""connections"" so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; he's under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is ""Andy,"" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is ""Warden Norton"" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, ""Shawshank"" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.

A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. ""Red,"" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.

In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: ""....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason...."" Most viewers will agree.",10
"The classic can be recalled repeatedly. Andy is full of yearning for life and freedom. To get out of prison is a new life for him; and red, who has been used to prison life, has become numb. To get out of prison is death for him.",9
"So worth seeing in the theater thanks to fathom events and 25th anniversary plus Stephen King turned 72 recently! I admit I've been on the fence about enjoying Shawshank Redemption for a while but seeing it in the theater and re watching after not seeing it for a long time, I cried, I laughed, felt sympathy, and was very immersed.

Truly remarkable and well deserving of every good opinion even after I was on the fence about it, I love the movie a lot now; Tim Robbins embodied such a glorious character! Frank Darabont made such a crafty, dark and heart wrenching experience! Fathom events is excellent, I am glad I paid over $13 dollars to see such drama perfected film.",9
"If you like hopeful, surprising, never-seen-before characters, you will enjoy this amusing story of a family of prisoners victimized by the system and a Bible thumping pig.

Robbins and Freeman, and everybody else, gives perfect performances for their characters. Their actions and body languages are perfect for this story and movie.",10
"In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it.

The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.

Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont.

SPOILER ALERT!

As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing ""Fat @$$"" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his ""Rehabilitated?"" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls ""500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,"", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.

END OF SPOILERS!

I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it. Movies like 'The Shawshank Redemption' only come along once every decade, if that. Unforgettable.

10/10.",10
"This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.

Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.

The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.

Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.

The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.

It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.

Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.

Here is a DVD every home should have.

This Is Such A Classic And One Of My Favorite Movies Always Loved Watching This Movie,7
"The emotions, the plot, originality, everything tied together so well at the end - normally I criticise the way movies end, but this ending was phenomenal, not cliche at all. The brutality of the prison was well portrayed, and made me feel sorry for the characters.

All the characters were believable and had depth, and none of the scenes were dramatic, but there was tension throughout the film. I'm going to stop fangirling now, but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather!!",9
"I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!

Why? This was my question.

The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).

The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.

The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.

Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.

Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts.",9
"I was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying ""Wow"". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.

If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside, sit down, and enjoy the journey!",10
"Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a well educated banker, is wrongfully convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison at Shawshank Penitentiary. This movie follows his life as it falls apart and he succumbs to living as an inmate surrounded by hardened criminals and a strict bible thumping warden with his henchmen prison guards.

Saw this movie years ago and was absolutely stunned. This film is a genuine masterpiece and probably the greatest movie ever made. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and just steal the show as convicts turned best friends. The movie is perfectly paced with very real characters and emotions that are all captivating. The prison itself is very authentic and the set pieces are very realistic which captured the prison environment better than any other prison set film except for maybe Escape From Alcatraz. Even as a hard drama this movie is never slow or boring or dry it is simply just that good.",10
"This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likeable or in the case of the pigs so detestable.",10
"It's difficult to review a movie made 25 years ago and say there has been nothing better since, but it is true. The storytelling and the production and the acting and the morality and the good guys and the bad guys and the hope it conveys..., But seeing this in 2021 (again) I have to say the praise is justified.

There is just something about Shawshank Redemption.

Want to know something amazing? Look at the director's credits. Not into cashing in, is he?",9
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema! The Best Hollywood Film Of All-Time! A Masterpiece! A cult classic! A legendary Epic! A Film that you moves you, leaves you stunned!

Performances: Tim Robbins is astounding, his careers finest after Mystic River. Morgan Freeman is masterful, his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby. Others are excellent.

'The Shawshank Redemption' is cinema at its very best. My salute to this flick! A true Masterpiece! I just love this film! The most powerful film of all-time.",10
"This film will stand the test of time And it will remain one of the best films ever made

Please do not remake this gem It must be left alone..

Superb",7
"Quite deserving of such acclaim, the acting is superb, the storyline captivating, and the cinematography quite beautiful. The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold. Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly. And let's be honest, how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad?",8
"I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption"" from the book ""Different Seasons"" more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.

It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome.",9
"You have already watched this, right? It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I'm seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don't as a rule. Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.",9
"I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a ""Rocky""-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.

I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).

If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.

I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.

I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it.",10
"It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.

I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.

Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.

Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.

9/10",8
Don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10.,7
"The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA.

A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails.

The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.

The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.

Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 10/10",10
Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone.,9
"Storyline is really good so it's a story from Stephen King's book, how can be bad? But that's not enough to be the top rated movie of all time.

But people are confused about something. That thing is this movie is not the best movie of all time, it is the highest rated movie. That makes it doesn't matter your age or gender or what genre you like, you'll like this movie. Yes, it can be your favorite movie but objectively I won't trust your opinion on movies that much.

The movie has really good acting and screenplay and these are the most important things in a movie. Also Costume Design and Set Decoration is really good. But this movie average quality of Cinematography, Scores and Sound Effects. Okey maybe that scores or cinematography is not bad but we are talking about the top rated movie of all time. The Green Mile is directed by same person, Frank Darabont. And that movie has amazing Screenplay, Film Editing, Acting Cinematography, Makeups, Costumes, Art Direction and Set Decoration. All of them are really good, just scores are average. But as I sad in this movie we don't have amazing Cinematography, Film Editing, Original Scores...",10
"Three words: Oh. My. God.

How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.

This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.

I mean, for gods sake, its so damn good it takes your breath away! i seriously could not speak after it! it instantly took every other film i had seen under its shadow, and that's saying something, as i have seen some pretty excellent films.

There's not a single actor or actress in this movie who is crap!!! standouts are Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins, and the dude who plays brooks.

I could say 1239643609260246704272628xinfinity more things good about this movie, but unfortunately I haven't got that much space, and my fingers would get sore.

An absolute must see for everyone, and I'm positive that ill never see another movie better than this, and this will stay at #1 on my list forever.",10
"There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story.

Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film.

On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.

This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.",10
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).

Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.

If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.",10
"If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.

However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.

But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.

"Superb movie.

Based on a Stephen King short story, the story of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), sent to prison for murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he is befriended by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) who helps him survive the harsh prison life.

A beautiful, moving story. Characters are steadily and solidly developed, and you feel an empathy for the main characters. Direction by Frank Darabont is subtle, and perfect. Pacing is spot- on.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in the lead roles. Freeman got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his efforts.

Well deserving of all the praise heaped upon it. Just a pity it didn't garner any Oscars, losing out, in the most part, to a far inferior movie, Forrest Gump.",7
"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.",10
"What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's a prison movie, yes, but it is so much more than that. First, let me divvy out kudos to those who deserve it: Stephen King for writing this magnum opus, Frank Darabont for his stellar directing, Tim Robbins for the job he did and, of course, Morgan Freeman for knocking the ball out of the park one this movie.

This was a movie that could be loved and felt by men and women alike. It was about losses and gains, hope and despondence, injustice and rectitude, and definitely about friendship. Prison just happened to be the backdrop of this film but it could have easily been anyplace. The prison setting played a critical role and was interwoven into the overall story but it wasn't the story. The story was so much more and the movie did so well in pulling you in and making you care. You couldn't help but loathe the warden and his right-hand-man. You couldn't help but like Andy and Red. You couldn't help but want the happy ending.

Absolutely, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It didn't get the awards it deserved, but like the Utah Jazz in the late 90's playing the Bulls, Shawshank Redemption faced tough competition. Although, it is getting its recognition here and it deserves the high praise.",8
"Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called ""The Shawshank Redemption."" It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the ""Sisters"" who enjoy torturing what they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis ""Red"" Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. ****",7
"As I said in the summary, there are too many reviews for this movie and it's among the best movies of all time. So, why I wanted to review it? Because this movie touched me so deeply and I found it so great and powerful that I have to say my opinion at all costs. This is out of my system, now I can go to the review.

THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a masterpiece and only a idiot wouldn't watch it (or hate it). Everything in this movie is perfect: the dialogue is clever and well written, with many great lines (included also in the narration by Morgan Freeman), the cinematography is great, the soundtrack is among the best that were ever heard in 1990s movies, and the performances are very strong and heartfelt. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give their best performances in their careers. Robbins is hard to empathize with at the beginning, but more the movie goes on more you come to like him. Freeman also narrates the movie, and here is suave, easy to empathize with and likeable (as in all his other movies). And also the supporting players in the movie are good, including James Whitmore in one of his final roles as Brooks Hatlen.

My favourite scene apart the tear-jerking ending? The scene of the inmates listening to the Mozart aria through the speakers. So, you don't have to like prison dramas for liking this movie. Yes it's depressing and sad in points - but is also perfectly and cleverly written and acted, and deserves all the praises that received. A movie that has to be seen at least once, and if you don't love it I suggest you to go to a psychiatrist!",10
"It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time.

Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning.

It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks.

Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple ""prison drama"", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free.

"I will never forget the first time I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film ""with the poster"" was.

Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone ""The Godfather"" from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly.

This is the strength of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.

In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence.

And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is ""Get busy living or get busy dying"". Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is ""The Shawshank Redemption""

In the same vein than ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Shawshank"" is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : ""Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose."" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.",10
"Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...

Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why?

I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the ""hell on earth"" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...

Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that ""Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him."" Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...

Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!

The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip ""The Letter Duet"" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro"" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: ""Music makes you free!""

The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any ""corrupted decency."" Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.

To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony..."" I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: ""Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible!"" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed?",8
"A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont. . . Who? Starring Tim Robbins. . . Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck? I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie. Now the only questions I have to ask are: Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie? and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar? Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan. Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'. Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow. Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach. . . Perfect.",10
"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.

TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as ""the only guilty man in Shawshank."" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape.

Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.

It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.",9
"My top film. Hope is good, and it never dies. 🌲🌲🌲",10
"I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far I'm concerned it's mine to give, if I want to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I don't). I am just sick of people telling me that a movie can't be great because it was story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven movies, I certainly liked this one. So here's another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.",7
"After ten years, I watched this movie again. I wanted to see whether my thoughts will change or not, because ten years ago I did not understand why this movie is at the top. Still, I think it should not be even in top 50 movies, because nothing is special. Years are passing just like a moment, I could not feel his pain or hope. In one scene, he wants something than bum it is happening. Again, for one scene his situation is so bad, than guess what happens? After just 30 seconds, he is good. So you never go top or down during this movie. My suggestion is it is better to watch this movie without the number 1 expectations. The best coutes: ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged."" - Red",10
"Truly a masterpiece of cinema. I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by. Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film. How did it not win oscars galore. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story. A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints. I LOVE THIS FILM!",7
"A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly ""stares-off-into-the-distance"" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack.",10
"When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!

be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic",10
"""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best thing.""said Andy.

I've been told a couple of times this movie is a must-watch before I die. A movie with almost all actors, and in a prison, is a bit masculine to me. Yet I occasionally read it on Wikipedia and also saw that in Netflix by chance, I gave it a go.

On the ground of some personal experience I could feel how Andy feels. This movie is about persisting faith of oneself and of life, even for those serving lifetime sentence.

""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'"" is the best quote. If you are in search of a powerhouse movie, this would be the choice.

I am from Hong Kong, I would also recommend ""The Greed of a Man"" (a Hong Kong drama) and ""Itaewon Class""( a South Korea drama). The male lead achieved their lifetime goal spending long enough time like Andy. We all know they are fictions, but so what? Just learn the message.",10
"Almost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring popularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its poor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark setting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all have hope, and we all feel imprisoned – whether it's by a dead-end job, a loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body – and it's only the hope that things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do precious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The Shawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while simultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses it to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if unlikely friends – at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope of any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw he later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind bars. By the end of the film both have changed – and both are released.

The film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic guard, the corrupt warden – fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were mostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way lately – the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of survival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's familiarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're faced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent prisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around looking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other prisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with few unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a society that has effectively discarded them.

The irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars – as Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a criminal – while those ostensibly representing justice and law are violent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance, when it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films that engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one engineered here by Dufresne – another reason for its phenomenal popularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden (although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves their come-uppance.

Darabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit while the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's a shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the beach looks exactly like what it is – a tacked on ending to keep the men in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of purpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure",10
"Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate ""Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either! Perfect ending as well.",8
"You could describe ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in a number of ways; engrossing drama, riveting character study, top-shelf prison movie. But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.

And that cast is impeccable.

9/10",8
"a film about freedom. not only because the story has as scene a prison. but for the force and grace and precise of creation freedom of actors and director, ideas and dialogs, whole script and special emotions of viewer. it is a rare film because it represents more than brilliant acting or smart script. it is a homage for basic values and eulogy to friendship. it is representation of a form of revolution who can be considered fruit of a different religious perception. it seems be perfect. and this is key to be more than a good/interesting film but an extraordinary cinema lesson. Red, Rita Hayworth poster and Andy Dufresne. that is all. at first sigh.",10
"Based on ratings by users, I can see why this film is rated number 1 on IMDb.

A film about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who claims he was falsely imprisoned. He decides to adjust to life while incarcerated, and befriends a number of his fellow inmates, including Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman). Andy establishes respect among his cohorts and even the prison guards by doing a number of things in improving life in the prison, including expanding a library and helping people do taxes. The men's friendships grow over the years as try to find, as the IMDb plot puts it, ""solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" This movie is on the longer side, being over two hours long. However, the many elements in this film do not drag, making this movie an intriguing and exciting feature. The plot and subplots were solid, blending together well, and the cast of characters gave a strong, dramatic and memorable performance. There were action, humor, drama, tragedy and hope all mixed in, providing you a very entertaining film.

There are far too many aspects of this film to be mentioned all at once in this review. Therefore, you will have to see and follow this movie for yourself to appreciate it. It is certainly worthy of its seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture (Forrest Gump won that year). A must-see for anybody.

Grade A",10
"Greetings from Lithuania.

It is very hard to call ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) a masterpiece, but it is a definitely one of the most inspiring and beautifully crafted picture off all time. That said, i won't going into details, as plot and everything about this movie is so well known. To simply put, this is a story of two men in prison sentenced to life time and their journey to redemption.

Seeing this movie ~ 5 times in my life i can say that when some time passes, you kinda feel a need to re-watch it again, because this movie is like a journey itself, with characters drawn so sharply that we do care about them and the outcome is one of the most powerful and hope inspiring there is. I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.

Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn't mainstream action at all. Good things never get old, and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one the fainest examples.",10
"Decent entertainment, somewhat memorable. Why this is seen as such an incredible, sensational work of art is beyond me... I feel like this is one of the few crime-thriller-prison-action related films that met my expectations, as in, was A Good Film, but that alone doesn't make it a classic.",10
"This is it, I have always been so careful on not getting carried away while watching great films and calling it the best. I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.

But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film.

This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them.

This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling. Of having found the best film, being a huge film lover. 10/10 - the only time I ever did or would do this on IMDb or elsewhere.",3
"I am not black, not a crook, not a prisoner, not a Christian retarded warden and not from that period and yet i identify with these guys, their plight and their times.

The story is entertaining, the characters interesting and the plot development anticipatory and fascinating.

Makes me forget for 2 hours that I live in a period of remakes, sequels, gender switches, DCU, MCU and... GAG.",10
"When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie",9
"I had never heard about this film before. It was just one day while I was searching my local DVD store this year that I found a brand new, special two-disc collector's edition. The title attracted me, and as I browsed the internet before buying the disc, I was blown away by the response the film had got. I instantly brought the DVD, but sadly couldn't watch it for long. Today, I finally decided to watch it, and by the time it ended, all I had was the happiness of watching a heart wrenching drama and a smile on my face.

THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is truly a timeless masterpiece. It's a very old film, but no matter how many times you watch it, you're gonna love it. This is a very emotional and inspiring prison drama which is worth watching by one and all despite of its content rating. Not only has the film been written and directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, it also has stellar performances coming from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Believe me, the two make the best buddies I've ever seen in a film till date.

SR is a pure drama with some crime element thrown in. But it doesn't fail to impress and entertain you, and even surprises you before the time it ends. It makes sure that you get inspired and moved by the message it delivers with perfection. Another great thing: it has no romance to hinder the story. It's a heartwarming, effective and unforgettable character drama which makes you unable to get from your seat till the very end.

Some think it's overrated, but honestly, it isn't. After all, this is a film which anyone who likes movies, especially dramas, can very easily appreciate. I just liked to see Tim and Morgan in a frame, because whenever they come together, there's something wonderful going to happen. The dialogues are brilliantly written: there are a lot of lines bound to be remembered forever.

Technically too, the film shines. A film set within a prison could've been devoid of any visual excellence but the cinematographer has totally nailed it, providing us with the clear vision of what the director wanted us to see. Through this entire duration of 140 minutes, I felt a different range of emotions from sadness to happiness to even anger at times. It's that powerful.

Saying anything more would sound like an understatement. Many others have already praised the film in their respective reviews, and I totally appreciate that. It's sad that such a great film wasn't a commercial success. But its real success lies in being the most memorable drama of all time. I really feel happy and lucky for having brought the DVD.",10
"The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound. And he wasn't. This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws. These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.

I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results. I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.

Don't get me wrong. A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind. Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great. It's a very good story very well told. Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ... Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role. (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.) Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can. Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well.",3
"Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them ""The Woman In The Room"", directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?",3
"i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..

andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..

i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time..",10
"Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.

The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison. Andy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison.

Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely 'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for Andy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his friendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events.

Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons, both comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.

As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a serious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's decisions become more and more unpredictable.

Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults at all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But, what makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script and the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many of the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in.

This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is endlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination. Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling, and satisfying story it entails.",9
Tye movie is just perfect. The acting the story the characters are just so good that they will even make you cry,3
"I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.",10
"Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didn't think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was ""cool"" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.

I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The ""weaknesses"" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.

In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time.",9
"This movie is a total piece of manipulation. It does have a few redeeming features though - Morgan Freeman's narration all through is pure art!!! This guy acts with his mouth!!! As a piece of fiction it has some merit and I can see why many people would enjoy it. But to be classed as one of the best movies of all time - really? C'mon!!! Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.

The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true. There are many people like that who are totally institutionalized and do not have the skill to survive on the outside without a good support network in place.

This is a movie for those people who like everything laid out perfectly for them and doesn't require any thinking. Personally I like a bit more depth and reality.

I don't want to put people off seeing it - it should be watched once. But for me the flaws outweigh its redeeming features.",7
"Great music, superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars. It was not fair.

The only reason for which I rented this movie, two years ago, was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then )

It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND REDEMPTION.

IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YOÚ WON'T REGRET.",6
"If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.

There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.

Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.

This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this.",10
"This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.

I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.

I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.

I give it 11/10.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about.

Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again.

I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that.

Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes.

I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it.

10/10",10
"A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.

It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.",10
"Last week, I had seen ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" and I feel it is one of the best movies ever made, especially in these hard to entertain folks at the movies for $10 a seat times. I couldn't understand how some, as minority as their voices were, could not like that film.

That was until I decided to sit down and write how I feel about this film.

In the 9 years since it has come out, I have attempted to watch it 12 times. Three of those times, I slept through it. I finally took some extra caffine Coke and gave it a twirl -- twice. Sorry, I just didn't warm up to this film. Robbins and Freeman's acting was good, but I guess the story wasn't original -- or surprising to me. I just didn't care about these guys, nor anyone else. It's prison. The guilty as well as the innocent are there -- I get that concept. Sometimes you're released after serving time, sometimes you're not. You make friends...fine. I dunno, kinda reminds me of 4 years of High School or college I guess. I just don't care about those folks no matter what we all did together once I got out, which is why I just didn't care about these and wondered why they should. Move on. Thanks for sharing. Snooze.

First I thought, I might not be a big ""prison"" entertainment fan, but then I remembered one of my favorite films is ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" (which I thought much from this film owes homage to), I really fell in love with ""The Green Mile"" (which was more on King's level than this) and I actually sat through a few seasons of HBO's ""Oz"" which was gritty and scary, to say the least. I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them. (If you're wondering, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is another.)

The point is...as I was going to write awful things to those few folks who didn't like ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"", I find myself here at ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and now I am able to stand where they were -- for a moment -- in the minority.

All things are not wonderful to all people.

And that's....a good thing.",10
"Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the history of hollywood.",8
this film is an award winning achievement i loved it what a fantastic and brilliant together drama and crime movie really really amazing a must see to everyone.the story is about a guy called Andy Dufresne who was sent to prison for a murder that was committed to his wife and Andy goes through prison with hard times and a friend for his time in the shaw shank prison with brilliant ac tining from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and Clancy brown throughout the film Tim Robbins was Andy Morgan freeman red and Clancy brown as the guard.overall the whole truth can not be told u will love this film don't spoil this for your self its a brilliant story with friendship and survival 10/10 you must get this on DVD trust me its brilliant,6
"This is it.

The film has it all. Superb actors, even better screenplay, fabulous redemptive conclusion and believe me when I insist with all of that said they did not forget the entertainment.

Are there/will there ever be any other films like this?",10
"I cannot think of one reason I would not give this 10/10 just out of principle. Otherwise, it is the perfect movie with an incredible story, acting and euphoric finale that nonetheless is not without tragedy in the meantime.

I need to find the original story.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.",10
"It is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of redemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the 40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through the front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as a weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won't last. He's wrong.

Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars. The warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on bringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.

That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes two-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank, and Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy's influence) learns a thing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual change, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious insider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of redemption. As strange a title it may be, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a worthy one.

At the end of the day, ""Shawshank"" is a good film - but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is: it's about as likable and mass-marketed as possible. There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it plays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very interesting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort -- it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration.

That's a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway, it doesn't leave much of an impact. It's just a well-made but manipulative and self-important film.",10
"This is the best movie robbed of acclaim. I don't care what anyone says about Forest Gump. This movie is better in almost every category except music and maybe tied for movie of the year.

Tim Robbins acting is as good if not better than Hanks. I always have a problem with the simpleton character getting acting nods, as with the white trash and ghetto thug characters. I think most of us can all do the Gumpy Slow Hick voice ala Cleatus the Slacked Jawed Yokel (Simpsons).

I can't quite remember how many Oscars Gump stole from this GEM of a movie, but this movie blows me away on almost every level. The quite passion the Robbins portrays is surpassed by no one except maybe the Freeman sidekick character.

This movie was of course a short story made into a movie (S King i think) and because of what it delivers i truly believe it to be the best movie of 1994, and probably one of the top 3 movies of all time.",10
"I'd never heard of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.

It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.

I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a ""sleeper,"" on DVD or cable or satellite.

My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Heat."" I didn't see ""Forrest Gump"" until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.

Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose ""Shawshank"" will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making ""Hey, it's not all that!"" (That is, it's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)

Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.

(Ditto for ""The Big Lebowski,"" which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like ""Rocky Horror"" once was. I saw ""Rocky Horror"" in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)

For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable.",10
"Movies simply do not get better than this.

Inspiring, captivating, intense, funny (at times), tragic (at times). Interesting and thrilling.

Every aspect of this movie is perfection: the acting, story, dialog, production, setting, cinematography, etc... all perfect.

This film is truly flawless.

I could not describe this movie as ""fun"" but I would describe it is unparalleled in its excellence- and not in some stupid artsy sense- just plain and simple it is story telling at its finest.

If you haven't seen this movie, you absolutely need to watch it right now. Fantastic. I wish I could give it a higher rating than 10 out of 10 stars.",3
"For it's subtlety, it's intelligence, and it's gorgeous cinematography (often overlooked in this film), this is one of the finest films ever made. Robbins and Freeman are brilliant. The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless. The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by Frank Darabont. A powerful story of one man's journey through a punishment he did not deserve, and ""redemption"" of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers. It reminds us that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things"". Gentle and supremely smart.",3
"I saw (once again) last night ""Shawshank Redemption"". If I have seen it once, I have seen it fifty times and never does it ever get tiring to me. Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time.

""Shawshank"" is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life, love and prison to remain the true person he always was. Andy, although a solitary and enigmatic person, finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse. In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope. Red is one of those humans. Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity, Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current ""human"" existence. I use the word EXISTENCE for the whole movie is a work of existential survival.

This is a movie that NO ONE should miss.",10
"This Film has a Strange History. Nominated for Seven Oscars (winning none) the Movie was not a Box-Office Hit and Faded pretty much into Obscurity as an Arty Film with two Lead Actors Delivering Standard Good Work, but Nothing to get Excited about.

But Something Happened that is Really Unexplainable. People got Excited about it. No one seems to know Why or What Manifested said Excitement, it just Happened. A Resurrection to become one of the most Beloved Movies Ever. Managing to Steadily Climb to ""God-Like"" Status among Best of Lists and Fanatic Praise.

It is a Fine Movie. A Throwback Movie. A more or less Standard Storytelling of Human Perseverance and Hope against Outrageous Misfortune. A Feel Good Film that has made a lot of People Feel Good. Nothing Really Out of the Ordinary Happens as far as Prison Dramas go. But what does Happen is done with such Subtlety and Pathos that the Long Sentence of the Running Time goes by Effortlessly.

This is a Great Movie that Never tries to be Great. it's just a Smooth, Entertaining, and Effective Personal Prison Drama with some Social Messaging and Character Explorations. The Usual Prison Sledgehammer Approach gives way to a Rock Hammer. Small and Light, but it gets the Job Done.",10
"It is a cinematic masterpiece that delves into the profound human experiences hidden within the darkness of a prison. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman's captivating performance as Red create an indelible bond that transcends the boundaries of their confined world. Director Frank Darabont weaves a poignant tale of hope, friendship, and the pursuit of redemption against the backdrop of injustice and despair. The film's visual splendor and evocative soundtrack enhance the emotional depth of the story, leaving audiences inspired and deeply moved. ""Finding Beauty in the Shadows: The Shawshank Redemption"" reminds us that even in the bleakest of circumstances, the human spirit can find solace and beauty, making it an enduring and cherished classic.",8
"It takes audiences on an unforgettable cinematic journey, exploring the indomitable human spirit and the pursuit of redemption. Tim Robbins delivers a compelling performance as Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully convicted and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. Through his unlikely friendship with Red, portrayed brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, the film delves deep into the complexities of human connection and the transformative power of hope. Frank Darabont's directorial finesse brings Stephen King's novella to life, painting a poignant portrait of resilience amidst a harsh and unforgiving prison environment. With its thought-provoking themes, stellar performances, and emotionally resonant storytelling, ""Finding Redemption: The Shawshank Journey"" continues to captivate audiences, earning its place as one of cinema's most beloved and timeless classics.",10
"It is a timeless tale of hope and resilience that remains deeply impactful to this day. Set within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film intricately weaves a narrative of human spirit's triumph over adversity and the enduring power of hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver captivating performances, infusing life into their characters and making their journey truly unforgettable. Under the skilled direction of Frank Darabont, the film's storytelling unfolds seamlessly, drawing the audience into a world of despair and redemption. Through its exploration of friendship, injustice, and the pursuit of freedom, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" resonates with audiences worldwide, leaving a profound and emotional impression that lingers long after the credits roll.",7
"I have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being about a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one viewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it.

The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.

Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen.

The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb.",6
"I knew about this movie for a long time.

Heck, prison movies, don't turn me on so I have very negative impression, hence not watching it. I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it was on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least this way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.

Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost respect.

This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and seeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.

To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a really amazing film.

This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So technically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots, music and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews.

The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can be flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.

The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious levels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.

You can't as its so simple.

We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.

Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live. Not doing so, there is no meaning to life.

No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?

Are you Positive?

Do you have hopes?

Do you have dreams?

Do you have goals?

Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal gain?

If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are not alive, you have no meaning to your life.

In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did, but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.

If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end it now.

So my advise to you?

Don't Watch this film.

If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you are a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable life, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you several lifetimes probably to get it.

So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it.",8
"A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?

One user put it very well when they said that the film's essential message of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an' everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.

There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan's ""In the Name of the Father"" springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.

Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?

I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!

I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.

#2 of 250? I don't think it would make it into my top 50 films.

Ah well, life's all about opinions...",4
"Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10. I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and loved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say ""OMG, I love this story!"" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm totally freaking insane for at least one more day...

But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man convicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and quickly becomes one of their own.

Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison, as narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both. Andy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his financial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value, but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense.

The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It is about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith. How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we recover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our connections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It is alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made.",10
This is the best movie I ever watched in my entire life.whenerver I feel sad or depressed I always watch this movie.it always gives me hope.Hope is a good thing.,7
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.

Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.

Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.",10
"Watching this film made me think about the genre of ""prison""-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what ""shawshank"" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in ""the hole"" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say ""starwars"" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.

Regards Simon

Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions.

The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.

In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.

One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.

""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,"" from ""The Shawshank Redemption.""

As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.

Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying.

But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit.",10
"Don't know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site - but just saw a friend's DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run, and caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely sometime following.

This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings.

Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single exception.

My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and widely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm, that whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or keyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he had bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today, if such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more possible.

I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the firewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements.

This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and ""nasty-nice"" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor, often even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as well as humanly possible, with his performance in this role

This is a film for which the term ""perfect piece of entertainment"" does not exaggerate.",7
"This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.

I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.

Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.

This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character.

The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.

There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.

I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.

***** out of *****",10
And i think it might be the best movie of all time.,10
"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (""Red"") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and ""Red"" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in ""The Shawshank Redemption.""",10
"An overrated film that I watched as a teenager and recently decided to re-watch. I must say right away that I like this film, but it is undeservedly and too popular and occupies the first line - this is completely undeserved in comparison with other films of more talented authors. I am very saddened that people do not see other works, and for so long this film has been number one among the best films. The actors are talented, the plot is just good, not brilliant, like Stanley Kubrick in ""A Space Odyssey"". Even this I am ready to see in the top-1, but not ""Shawshank Redemption"". I understand that many will disagree with me or say that I just hate, but this is not true, and you can understand this by comparing it with other films, is this film so good and does it deserve the first place?",10
"I had been meaning to see this film since it is rated #1 on IMDb. It is a very good film and very well acted; however, no wayyyyyy is it the best film of all time. Morgan Freeman is particularly good as Red and the other actors perform very admirably, but I don't find the film overwhelmingly powerful. I've seen many many films that do more. I rate it a 7 out of 10.",10
"I liked this film. That sums it up pretty well. This film is good, in some aspects very good, but the best film of all time? I usually don't say this, but I think The Shawshank Redemption is overrated. I don't want to take away from the performances, the story or the score, those were really good. I guess Opinions differ and that's fine. For me personally the fact that I knew that this film was ""the highest rated film of all time"" unfortunately hurt my experience. I was expecting a lot more, which in the end I didn't get. But still a good watch nonetheless.",10
"Come on guys! According to the IMDb Top 250 THIS is the second best film EVER!! Better than Citizen Kane? Better than Godfather Part II? Better than ALMOST EVERYTHING?!?!

No, it's a very, very long, very, very predictable, very, very cliched, very. very old-fashioned and sentimental film, blessed by some good performers (especially James Whitmore, who, alas, does not figure prominently enough.)

It worries me that many of the comments here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare, when in actual fact, it wallows in all the conventions of its genre.

I give it 6/10, mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

The only people who could mistake this for a Great Film, would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature.",3
Just watched it today....better late than sorry...amazing movie.,10
"This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.",6
Nice title :) 10/10 best one i have seen my dude couldn't get any better,10
"My favorite movie ever. These are words that basically describe how I feel about this movie. A prison drama does not sound like an entertaining movie, but this is very entertaining. Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover. He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven). Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things. It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it. Tim Robbins is great in the lead. Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden. William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict. Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards. Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts. A must see.",6
"A fair number of the movies that rank high on this site's top 250 all time list also share a parallel 'life' as literature, so let's start there.

The book ""Rita Hayworth, etc..."" is the best of the 'Different Seasons' tetralogy. King adhered to the first person perspective, which is a challenge: the narrator can only know what comes into his range of perception. You as the reader have to decide if you trust him, and so on. King wrote this in the early hand-to-mouth period of his existence -- and what do we have? A prisoner who persistently writes to his benefactors for 'more funding'.

Darabont didn't have the skill necessary to really offer anything of artistic value here. We're stuck with borrowings: parts of ""Convict 99"", ""Gilda"", ""Brubaker"", ""Birdman of Alcatraz""; musically, the ""Marriage of Figaro"" aria -- it's actually not a bad bit of self-reference. It's the only good visual part here, and even that is smothered by the narration; literarily, Dumas' ""...Monte Cristo""...

The book does a good job of playing with the readers' expectations and using irony. There's no preaching. And it ends far more intelligently than this does; the denouement here seems to belong in a different movie altogether.

This isn't a bad movie; considering the obscene amount of money invested in these things, it's hard to find a truly bad movie any more -- one with no cinematic value at all -- that wasn't the case 20 - 30 years ago.

But there's no way I can love it. It just isn't the sort of movie that resonates with *me*, because the story is just 'there' with no life of its own.",10
"This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made. It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins. But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes). Very memorable, showing what movies are made of. Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie. A++",5
"The amazing thing about this film is how many people fail to realise that the film is about Red, not Andy. It's Reds perspective of Andy. I only mention it because many people strangely think its told from the perspective of Andy.

That common misunderstanding behind, a well made film. The photography is magical, the story is strong, the performances are exceptional and the depths of despair and humanity of canvassed well without losing mainstream appeal.

But that aside, there is a strong willingness to overstate this film. In the end, it is a slightly overdone and there is a bit too much 'triumph of the human spirit' dribble on the side. But I don't let that get in the way of what is otherwise a very good film with re-watch-ability.

Hadley's release from prison and letter deserves a spot in cinema history. That part was absolutely exceptional.",7
"What to say about the ""Shawshank Redemption""? I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin' immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect.",10
"It has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But I need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the ""smart"" people declare it like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn good...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!

Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. And I do, yes I do!",10
"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book, and I didn't liked it that much, but then I saw the movie. And that's a things that's never happened to me before, the movie was better than the book. It's the other way normally. But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie, it is great.",10
"We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.

This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!",3
"Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.

I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.

Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.",10
"I don't care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.

I saw this film in 1995 and still vividly felt the euphoria of the final half hour which stayed with me for a couple of weeks.

I was convinced this was the best film I had ever seen in my life, even better than Akira Kurosawa's Ran and One flew over the cuckoo's nest, which was my all time favorite until TSR came along.

I excitedly contacted my best friend who shared the same passion and he confirmed my thoughts,""this must be the best film I've ever seen!"" But it is sad though that I will probably never see a better film for the rest of my life as I have seen the best.

In music I have heard the best in Rush and Jackson Browne which made others pale in comparison and in movies I have TSR.

Hail Frank Darabont!",5
"It's amazing how long I could not watch this movie. However, I became interested in them only after reading the book. And the book is very good. However, the same can be said about the film. Yes, there are some nuances ...",10
"When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is, without a doubt, the greatest film ever made. You simply will never find a better film, ever.

The story revolves around a smart, kind hearted vice president of a bank named Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, who is absolutely brilliant in the starring role. Andy is sent to prison after murdering his wife and lover. Claiming he is innocent of the crimes, and was the victim of an unfortunate coincidence, the law does not believe him, and sentences him to life in prison without possibility of parole. Once inside, he immediately befriends a criminal by the name of Red, played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman. Andy then becomes the victim of fear, despair, and the prison itself, which is inhabited by crooked officials and hardened criminals. After a while, Andy finds the hope inside of him to never give up, with the help of his friend Red and others. He starts doing tax returns for the prison guards and the warden, and after a while, the warden, played by Bob Gunton, who makes the viewer loathe the word warden, has Andy doing his tax fraud for him. It's safe to say that Andy is ""friends"" with the officials.

I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't seen this picture, but believe me, you will be breathless. The hope Andy holds inside of him gives all of us a warm feeling inside of us, and tells you to never give up. The cast is perfect in every way, and the film just carries beautifully. You will find yourself praying for Andy through the whole film, through bad times and even good times. It is wonderfully capped off with a surprise twist ending that will leave you shocked, stunned and emotionally breathless.

I call this film my all time favorite, because I agreed with the characters, felt for them, hoped for them and in the case of the corrupt characters, loathed them, due to great acting. I was able to actually hate and detest certain characters, because that's how wonderful the acting is. I would actually have cried at this movie, if it weren't for me being so emotionally paralyzed by the cast and story.",4
"This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.

The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard. The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors. (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience ""It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..."" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand. While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art.",6
"It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!",10
"This movie is a fine way to spend 140 minutes, but is by no means a movie of the first rank. The script is far too simplistic, cliché-ridden and predictable. The characters are far too good guy/bad guy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course of 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And, just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas the people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....

Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among inspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.

In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing.",10
"I remember when i first saw this film. my friend kept telling me to watch it as he thought it was brilliant. well, all good things come to those who wait yes? i did something I had never done before or since: when i finished watching it i rewound it and watched it again straight after.It has a perfect cast, story and the best ending of any film i have ever seen.To sum up in one word: magical!",10
"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, ""Shawshank"" was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****",7
"It is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that unfurls a profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship, and the unyielding human spirit. Tim Robbins portrays Andy Dufresne, a man unjustly imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, while Morgan Freeman delivers a captivating performance as Red, his fellow inmate and confidant. As the story unfolds within the walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film explores the resilience of the human soul and the transformative power of hope in the darkest of circumstances. Directed with skill and sensitivity by Frank Darabont, this timeless classic weaves a tapestry of emotions, leaving a lasting impression on its audience. ""Hope Unchained: The Shawshank Redemption"" continues to inspire and uplift, reminding us that even in the face of adversity, hope can set us free.",10
"I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling ""for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10",10
"Quite frankly, this is a movie of clichés. You want examples, I got examples! ""Some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are too bright"" or ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" or ""Terrible thing, to live in fear"" or ""It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away"" or ""need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone"" or ""Hope is a good thing, and good things can never die"" - if you say so, sensei!

Problem is Stephen King never leaves anything to the imagination. He tells us everything - if Tim Robbins organises some special event for the inmates, like playing music over the loudspeaker, Morgan Freeman's voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful/significant, the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie. And Darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick, and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience, and has made his movie by it.

Also, i'm starting to be wary of Thomas Newman as a composer doing exactly what Darabont has done as a director: employ a formula that has worked in the past. His score for Shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs, lows, and general atmosphere as in his score for Road to Perdition, American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, Horse Whisperer, Scent of a Woman, and The Green Mile, not surprisingly. If you think about all these movies, they all have a similar feel, they all go for a similar nostalgia, haunting sadness - which admittedly i find very appealing, but i'm starting to worry at how similar they all are.

I think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully - instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant. Most people do not evaluate movies based on their IMDb ranking, but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten.

That said, this is still a good movie, with good performances, a good unity, despite its necessarily episodic nature, and it looks great. Its only for movies people insist on putting on best-ever lists that i require a certain originality, the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else (I believe this is why movies like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, 2001, Raging Bull, Third Man, Grand Illusion, Persona and, for me, Exterminating Angel, are constantly mentioned on such lists, and deservedly). What this movie gave me, I could get from reading any other Stephen King story, or seeing any other movie adaptation of a King story.",10
"I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.

PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well.",8
"Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I've heard",9
"The acting is adequate, the story is adequate, but why all the fuss?

It sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the mill.

This is not that bad a film, just seen it all before.",6
"A powerful and moving story that showcases the human spirit and its resilience in the face of adversity.

The Shawshank Redemption is a life lesson. It teaches us that no matter how dark and hopeless our situation may seem, there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. It shows us that friendship, courage, and perseverance can overcome any obstacle and injustice. It makes us feel every emotion, from anger and sadness to joy and relief. It has amazing performances, a brilliant script, and a stunning soundtrack. It is a masterpiece that I can watch over and over again, and never get tired of it. It is the best film ever made, in my opinion.

It is a film that transcends its genre and becomes a timeless classic. It is one of the best films ever made.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s. There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people. There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger. If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white. Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions and so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond perfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years!",10
"I like to keep things short and sweet.
Incredible, unforgettable, three-demential characters that develop over the course of the film
Amazing story with tons of twists and turns you will never see coming
One of the best endings in film
Acting is outstanding
Great foreshadowing
Perfect runtime
I would say to stop reading this review and just watch it already but let's face it, you already have.",10
"I've been content to lurk and learn on this web site for months, but after reading the reams of glowing critiques of this film, I felt obligated to get an IMDB account and print a contrary point of view.

The Shawshank Redemption is an obvious, thinly characterized, visually uncompelling film. Whether it's the good guy/bad guy cliche or the white guy/black guy cliche, it's still the same old Hollywood.

This is not a film which discovers life through enigmas, dilemmas, and reflections. It is a film which wears its rather plain message on its sleeve.

3 out of 10. For prison flicks try Dancer in the Dark. Someone else recommended alternative prison flicks Kiss of the Spider Woman and Cool Hand Luke. I heartily agree with those choices.",9
"This movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it. It's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's absolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be fair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The Godfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the times, not even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""American Me"", they are stronger and wiser. But..people has the last word.",5
The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family. Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have seen tons of films. Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyone's heart. From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.,10
"One of the best films of all times. They don't make them like they use to, and we slowly forget what art is.",10
"This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once. Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!",10
"I always really enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption and my appreciation remains consistent with repeated viewings. With a 9.3 IMDB rating decades after it's release shows that this is a movie that speaks to people and I have not met anyone who doesn't like this movie. Among Steven King adaptations this is probably the best, I like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, just as much for different reasons. But don't tell Steven King that, lol. The Shawshank Redemption is much more than a prison movie, it's an absolutely engrossing movie that has audiences glued to the screen from start to finish. Director Frank Darabond did a fantastic job putting this together with top notch cinematography, direction and a great attention to detail. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable performances. The Shawshank Redemption is flawless filmmaking and storytelling that has few films that are it's equal. All and all, The Shawshank Redemption is perfect in my book and is recommended to anybody who wants to see a great movie.",10
"Best movie ive seen.

This movie 20 years on is still first class.",10
"WEll I had high hopes for this movie. But it fell way short. I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen. Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.

"What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called ""one of the best movies of all time"", ""a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom"" and a ""latter-day retelling of the Gospel story"". Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.

At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called ""life is unfair"".

It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, ""Shawshank Redemption"" is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed.",10
"In the long and storied history of cinema, there have always been those films, which are undoubtly overrated. However, none before and none since have been more overrated then The Shawshank Redemption. While the Shawshank Redemption is not a waste of your viewing times by any means, it is not the pinnacle of film making. The performances are good, especially Freeman, but I'm not too high on the way the plot works out. It doesn't really break any new ground, a man is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit(Wow, that's new!!), and learns to cope with his new circumstances, while befriending the prison veterans. While the audience learns a valuable lesson about the determination and courage of the human spirit! I don't know about you all, but when Robbins escapes from prison during a dramatic thunderstorm, there were more then a few tears coming down my face. When I see something like this rated in the top 10 films of the 1990s let alone of all time, I have to wonder about people's taste in general. The message of the movie isn't incredibly powerful nor is the plot. How can anyone consciously say this movie was the best ever? It boggles my mind, but I have a few theories. First this movie is recent enough and shown on TNT enough (like 5 times a month), that alot of people have seen it more then once. Younger people (I'm talking teens and twenties), who haven't seen many Dramas let alone the real ""great"" movies, will say this is the best. If you ask this same demographic what is the best comedy of all time, they are likely to say something like Happy Gilmore (which Caddyshack blows out of the water for best golf comedy). These are the kinds of people giving Shawshank it's highest praise, these people are sadly my generation.",10
"An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal. Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather, it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities. And finally if it was told in a non-linear tale then it would have been much more interesting",10
"By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history.",10
"Whilst the IMDb users may disagree, the Shawshank Redemption isn't my number 1, maybe not even my top 100. But with that said, I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary. There is no doubt it is good, I may even say it's close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating, but it's forced metaphors get on my nerves now and, in reality, is just another prison movie which is above average.

Boring if you have seen it a few times, but for a first impression it is good. Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is. A perfect film it is not, but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate. Not my favorite film, not my favorite prison film, but give it a whirl and see how you decide.",6
"I am bowled over by this movie. This is simply the best movie ever made. The story just leaves you moved and the performances in the movie are clearly the best performances ever on screen. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman enact their roles to perfection, they don't miss out even a dot in fulfilling the roles to excellency.

I cant believe i waited so long before i actually watched this movie, i should have watched it before, and then over and over again.

Don't be scared to watch this movie, you will be amazed by this masterpiece. I cant stop raving, I say WATCH IT NOW! 10 on 10 isn't enough!",10
"This is not just a movie. I cant explain it. A truly masterpiece, which tells the lesson that hope never ever dies, live your life",10
"In this era of television, and cable television, and satellite television, we are bombarded with movies, old movies, new movies, PPV movies, made for TV movies. There are so many outlets these days, that its unlikely that you'll watch any movie on TV today, and not have another opportunity to watch the same film, in its entirety within a week.

Amidst this morass of celluloid, and electronic representations thereof, there are films, which never leave you. You may be absentmindedly changing the channel on a Saturday afternoon, or late on a Friday night when you come across one, a scene, any scene, will play. Whether it be from the beginning, middle, or end, it hardly matters-- it is immediately recognizable to you. Your mouth will begin to make the words the actors are to say, unconsciously. A smile may come to your face as does a friendly, warm feeling inside, you may feel a tear, or fear the tear to come.

You will move aside the bedclothes you were changing in order to find a spot to sit on the end of the bed, you will adjust the volume to your taste. You will not go for a drink, or a snack, but remain, transfixed.

Such is the magic of movies, and there are many movies for many people, but 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one for us all. It is the sweetest music, and our conductor, Frank Darabont is indeed a maestro.

The wonderful story behind the making of the film starts with the generosity of Stephen King. King of course gets a premium price any time one of his novels is adapted. He has chosen to give young, unproven filmmakers an opportunity to adapt any of his short stories (as opposed to the novels) for the bargain basement price of $1. There is only one caveat, that they send him a video tape of their finished film. This opportunity, Frank Darabont took to advantage and made a short film, based on a King story, ""TheWoman in the Room"". And King was impressed. When years later Frank Darabont came back to King hoping to adapt something called 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', King was only too happy to accede.

What came from Mr. Darabont is true cinematic history. Thank you sir, thank you both.",10
"Ok, as I give this movie a 9, it is going to be hard to be critical, but I feel as though that is the responsibility of anyone who doesn't rate a movie a 10.

First of all, the acting was sensational - as good as I have seen in a long time. The direction was great and the script was great. And, it turned into (unexpectedly) a true buddy story.

I could only criticize a couple things - one of which was NOT the length - 2:20. I found it a little troubling that most of the criminals were extremely nice guys - except for the obligatory bad guys in the shower. I also have to confess a real distaste for the homosexual overtones - especially early on. But, then what prison movie attempting to depict real life could leave that out???

Also, prison movies in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's are not my favorite genre, however one of the advantages of prison movies are that you really don't care very much what period it takes place in. Anyway, that is just personal preference.

All in all, it deserves the praise it gets. I'm very glad I finally took the time to watch it.",10
"''He that lives upon hope will die fasting.'' - Benjamin Franklin

Frankly, I really don't get the praise for this film. It wouldn't even be in my Top 250.

The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings. Well, that and Morgan Freeman's calming voice.

Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism, to be honest.

Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like ""From Caligari to Hitler"" by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazi's after World War I. There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination.",10
"This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.

4 stars out of 4",10
"This film is perfect in every sense of the word. The second the movie starts it grabs you and holds your attention for the rest of the film. It is never boring. All of the hints that lead to the finale is absolutely genius, and the attention to detail is perfect. The third act is the best of all time. Roger Deakins gives one of his more subtle works, and it plays out beautifully. The dialogue is perfect, and you deeply care about the characters.",10
"In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. It's probably my favorite movie. It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but, the first time you watch it when you don't know what is about to happen, is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about the ending and for god's sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made. There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most. I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would have been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough. It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had to sit back breathless. I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned. A true classic!",10
"By far the best movie ever...

No Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see, It is easily the best movie of my life-time so far.

Morgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as well. Well written / narrated and directed movie of all times.

10 out 10.

It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie rating websites forever now.

The best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan Freeman.

The character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden character has lot of punch into it.

Escape from prison was the best it can ever get.

Marvellous piece of Art.",6
"''The Shawshank Redemption'' is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story. The story is excellent,the time has just flew with this movie. This movie just gets better with every showing. There's no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Everyone must watch this movie.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",10
"I found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable. It was, in many ways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie. It had a manipulative and superficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true. It never dealt deeply with any issue at all. Basically, you liked the leading character because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his success, just like Forrest Gump. However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could never see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character. He didn't like being sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't drink but got beers for his friends. He finds pleasure out of the simple things and doesn't like unpleasurable things. He turned out to be a perfect character with no negative qualities at all. Maybe he's this way for a reason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves being completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if they were in a situation like this.

In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being entirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad. I think the only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the message ""Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives."" However, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper meaning or insight. The best thing about this movie was it made me realize how great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks is. He made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality and allowed us to understand who he was. He seemed possible. Andy seems unlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his personality.

This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable. It's not a worthless movie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had. To the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me. My rating 4/10.",10
"An analysis of prison life--and of what hope can be in a prison--Frank Darabont's first film is one of the best ever. Well-written and well-acted, the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming, endearing, poignant. Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous--it's simply extraordinary drama.",8
"First when I saw how huge the overall rating was I wondered why. But then I told myself I should give it try, and truly it was totally worth it period. I miss this kind of movies. sush a masterpiece, it contain many lessons and significances about our life I'm still wondering how this masterpiece didn't win a oscar then I figured out that it is a small thing comparing this movie and if you don't watch it yet then you have miss a big part from your life",9
"I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption"" is an absolute masterpiece that effortlessly weaves together themes of hope, friendship, and the enduring human spirit. With impeccable performances from its cast, particularly Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film transports you into the gritty world of prison life while also touching your heart with its poignant storytelling. The expertly crafted plot, rich character development, and unexpected twists make it a timeless classic that leaves an indelible mark on anyone fortunate enough to watch it. The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic gem. Its powerful portrayal of hope, friendship, and resilience, along with standout performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, creates an unforgettable experience. The film's masterful storytelling, character growth, and surprising turns make it an enduring classic. A must-watch that tugs at your heart and mind.",9
"I am pretty sure I have watched it more than 50 times now , and I will watch it a 100 times more, shared the experience of this work of art and recommended it to many many people because i felt it will be selfish to keep it to myself. The movie is ageless, timeless and pure, it sticks with you forever. The shawshank redemption isn't just a movie, it is a feeling.",10
"While the acting is rather good, not all performances are flawless, nor matched with each other as well as they could be (see Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfella's, even Pulp Fiction for near flawless ensemble acting in films).

The film works but is a multi-derivative film, borrowing similar characters from several films and fashioning a film of fairly corny and unbelievable melodramatic moments to ultimately preach a message of hope.

While it's an entertaining film, it's not a very good film at all. It's strongest moments are borrowed from prison films as far back as 1930's Up the River which starred Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart (in his second role). While Shawshank is superior overall than some of the film it borrows from, it does not go any place other films have not already been before. While at times it borders on being brutal, it still is completely done with a rose colored glasses sensibility. Were it to more accurately portray any semblance of what the situation would be like it would be at times very difficult to watch and emotionally exhausting--which this film is not.

I am rather surprised it has received such high praise from so many. I suppose if voters would see films such as Attica, Breaker Morant, Brubaker, Cool Hand Luke, Cry Danger, The Glass House, Papillon, Pressure Point (1962), Riot in Cellblock 11, Short Eyes, and Yol for starters (films which concern men who are prisoners), they would realize how much of this film is borrowed from prior films.",10
"the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it.",10
"It shouldn't be lost on anyone that well into the 21st century, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been the No. 1 film, or close to the top for years among movie viewers who have rated movies on IMDb. With more than 2.4 million ratings just on this film alone, it's probably safe to say that it would stay close to its top spot in any public survey.

What a great film the Shawshank Redemption is. Even though thousands have written reviews already, a little should yet be said about great films that don't win the awards or become big box office hits, but become highly popular mostly for their story. That usually is a matter of justice, within the story itself, and for the film having been made. And, justice is the undergirding theme of this film.

For anyone who hasn't seen the film, the conclusion is a real surprise. And it brings to closure all of the angst and apprehension and concern one has about the wrong treatment of the hero, Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins. The narrative format adds to a sense of the drama and reality of a story as told by Red Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. One wants so badly to see an innocent man exonerated of the crime for which he was convicted. While the circumstances of the plot make that impossible, the alternative ending serves justice to the hilt. Because, in this way, justice is served on those who abused their power. The warden and guard commander couldn't be convicted for that, but in their evil ways they were open to other law violations for which they could be taken down

So, the ending satisfies justice and the hearts of so many viewers. It is reminiscent of a true story of a true gangster. The big-time gangster of the prohibition era, Al Capone, could never be caught and prosecuted for so many crimes he committed, including murder. But the federal government was finally able to convict him for income tax evasion which led to his imprisonment.

Here's a film that didn't even cover its costs at the box office when first released, and took a re-release to earn a modest sum. Yet it remains a favorite, far above many films that have won multiple academy awards over the years. While the cast all are very good, and the production qualities first rate, it's the story - the plot with a superb screenplay that makes this a great film.",8
"like ""The Shawshank Redemption,""The Green Mile"" is another case of a Stephen King story which translates well from the page to the screen.as in ""Mile"",this movie is also directed by Frank Darabont,who also wrote the screenplay.another similarity is the prison setting and the fact that the movie is seen and told through the eyes of one man (Morgan Freeman)who just happens to be a prison lifer and the things he sees as the years go by.he tells the story of one man who becomes a prisoner(TIm Robbins) and who he becomes friends with.the movie then chronicles their friendship and struggles in the prison system.unlike ""The Green Mile"",there is no mystical or supernatural element to this film.however,this film is of the same calibre of ""Mile"",owing to its solid writing, acting, and direction.""Shawshank"" is very dramatic,yet very compelling.it's also a very moving tale.it will likely impact you emotionally and intellectually. and before i forget,i must also mention the ending,which i thought was very strong.for me,""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a strong 10/10",10
"This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.

The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.

This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?

It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.

The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.

Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.

Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.

I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece.",8
"This is such a spectacular and mysterious movie. The lead guy plays his role like a Loki.

I first saw this movie back in high school.

It was one of the best movies I seen during that time. The story with out a doubt was remarkable. It's filled with twists and what the heck moments.",10
"Few movies in this world are as powerful as The Shawshank Redemption. This well-crafted drama drags your emotions through the wringer, only to have them come out clean & full of hope on the other side. The story is unquestionably compelling and absolutely memorable. In addition, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast create a collage of authentic characters that you both love & hate. This is a film that everyone should watch at least once a year to remind themselves of how good it really is.",10
"This is the best movie ever, I have watched a lot of movies and this one is the best of them all. The end irks great and it is just so damn good, watch the damn movie.",9
"I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time. I was 16-years-old and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a school night. So naturally I say to my father, ""Dad, I think it's time to watch Shawshank"". I almost regret watching it. It is that good. It's like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that 'The Shawshank Redemption' takes you on.

First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, ""So have you seen Shawshank?"". No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no, then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time. If they say yes, I have something to talk to them about for the next 27 minutes.

You probably still won't believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see. It's that good that I actually told one of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed. Then she will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to it. Now when I see a movie all I think is, I've already seen the best.

Now actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece (not that any summary of the plot could ever do it justice). So all I will say is this, I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother to finish reading this. Just go and watch it.",10
"The best jailhouse movie of all time! Right next to The Green Mile!

What we have here is another classic collectible. If you have or have not seen this film, it's one of those that have to be in your DVD collection... a film to pass down to the younger generation to inspire them on how film-making should be done.

An all star cast with outstanding performances and directing!

If you don't own this, add it to your collection!

A perfect and well deserves 10/10 from me!",9
"The film's been IMDb's #1 for as long as I can remember. That doesn't really raise my expectations, considering I don't agree with so many inclusions or exclusions. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best Picture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked it, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is fantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.",7
"Little more than average drama for popular tastes. Predictable, overly sentimental, and excessively long.

It's a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is at number 2 in the all time chart! However, predictably it's not in the top 100 more serious 'Sight and Sound' critics and directors polls that are held every ten years. Frank Darabont later proved to be no master with his two following films, the second rate 'The Green Mile' and the truly appalling 'The Majestic'. The fact that this pedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of real masters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. When I saw this movie I was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special.

I also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding) made one of the best performances of their life. Deserves to be noted that Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) made an also good performance.

I really recommend this movie to you and I am sure that you will love it because it's a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal movie with a very well developed storyline, outstanding character development and a fantastic cast. It's almost immediately engaging, I found myself engrossed by the story from the very first scene, as we follow Andy Dufresne in his journey in to prison, we feel the characters emotions, even without them being properly exposed and as the film progresses we see him form relationships in Shawshank prison that add a lot of depth. The character development in this movie is ridiculously well written and is what writers should look towards as inspiration, the relationship between Andy and Red, Brooks' entire story arch, the Warden and Captain's partnership, it's all very believable, as well as captivating thanks to a terrific script by Frank Darabont. The performances are all absolutely outstanding, Tim Robbins emotional, enclosed personality as Andy is terrific, Bob Gunton's sinister delivery, Clancy Brown's threatening persona, James Whitmore's innocent, uneducated attitude, it all comes together to create engaging, realistic people. However, the undeniable star of the show, and the main reason this film is #1 on IMDb's Top 250 has to be Morgan Freeman, his portrayal of Red is immediately enticing, he's a pure, honest man who keeps the story moving with narration, Freeman's voice-over work for this film adds that extra layer that was very necessary and added so much more power, his dialogue with Robbins is some of the best acting I have ever seen, and the moment in which he speaks about his parole for the final time is possibly the highlight of this amazing actors entire career. Very engaging, emotional, The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie, but I never found myself wanting it to end, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama.

Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two lifetimes in prison when he is convicted for killing his wife and her secret lover. He is miserable in Shawshank prison, but soon makes friends in the wise Red.

Best Performance: Morgan Freeman",8
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is currently the highest-rated film (on average) on the IMDb website, a position it has held for quite some time. After a recent re-watch, I completely understand the sentiment, and (at least for me) the reason is fairly simple: this is a film that doesn't fit into any certain genre box. Drama? Prison Movie? Caper film? Emotional tear-jerker? Yes to all. My favorite films are the ones that supersede labels, and ""Shawshank"" does exactly that.

For a basic plot summary, ""Shawshank Redemption"" tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man condemned to two life sentences in the maximum-security prison for the murder of his wife. While in Shawshank, Andy quickly befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man who ""knows how to procure certain items"" that Andy wants/needs. Andy, through his analytical wisdom, also gets in the good graces of iron-fisted Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and lead guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) by his ability to do tax returns and basically run the prison's money-laundering scheme. While initially this affords Andy some luxuries that other prisoners do not receive, including his persistence in building up the prison library, eventually he comes to a crossroads: become institutionalized or fight back against the system.

Without giving away the ending spoilers for those who may not have seen it, ""Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those movies that expertly balances the ""side quests"", so to speak, with the main plot arc, and everything comes out perfectly. That is a difficult thing to do in a film, as often the sub-plots crowd out the main storyline (instead of adding to it) or seem like filler. Neither of these things come close to happening here, as director Frank Darabont makes sure that balance is achieved.

I feel like ""Shawshank"" is one of those movies that almost gets the short-shrift in ""greatest of"" conversations because it has become so iconic as to almost be ""too present"". The ending is now classic, Freeman's narration is perfection (this was before being almost comically typecast as ""narrator guy"" down the road in his career), and every single character is interesting and advances key plots or character development. Basically, ""Shawshank"" is almost too iconic for its own good in the sense that it never strays too far from the ""film consciousness"". One has to just make it a priority to sit down and watch it from beginning to end from time to time to truly appreciate its greatness.

Perhaps the true staying-power of ""Shawshank"", however, is that it truly has ""something for everyone"" in terms of plot and characters. Some may get invested in whether Andy is guilty or innocent, others will marvel at his persistence in creating the prison library and contributing to prisoner education, while still others will identify with Red's side of the coin and how his character changes from the beginning of the film to the end of it. For me, the arc that always ""gets"" me (moving me to tears) is that of Brooks (James Whitmore), a prisoner for 40+ years at Shawshank who is finally released to the outside world. Despite the apparent freedom, Brooks cannot adapt to life outside the prison structure and social order. Living in a run-down apartment and bagging groceries at the supermarket, he conjures up plans to get himself back into prison where he can ""be somebody"" again. Basically, he has become ""institutionalized"", and that to me was maybe the most interesting theme in all of ""Shawshank"".

Simply put, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece of the highest order. If you haven't seen it yet, you are in for a real treat. Once your kids or relatives are ""of age"" to begin to comprehend the film's themes, show it to them too. Or, just sit down and watch it yourself for the ump-teenth time (like I just did). The characters will still be as vibrant and the themes will still be as applicable as the first viewing, and you'll likely pick up something new in every viewing experience. It is that expertly-crafted of a film.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is actually a short novel written by Stephen King. Tim Robbins is falsely imprisoned for the murder of his wife. He becomes best friends with Morgan Freeman and plots an escape using a small hammer to slowly create an opening in the wall which is covered with posters.

Freeman narrates the story and he and Robbins make a terrific pair struggling to survive prison life while keeping their sanity. They manage to make it through their days by dreaming of the perfect escape. King has written a tale of hope and inspiration which is adapted with great style and grace by Frank Darabont. He later made King's Green Mile in 1999, another excellent prison drama.",8
10 stars is to little for this film its one of the best of all time and it deserves every praise it have,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the most life affirming movie ever made. Through all the darkness, the pain and the heartbreak it's a testament to the perseverance of the human spirit that has one the most satisfying endings of all time, recontextualizing everything that's come before in the best way.

At the centre of this movie is Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both giving the best performances of their careers. Robbins has a natural kindness and quiet nature that makes him a perfect fit for Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman's ability to give great speeches and narrate in an incredibly gentle way matches Red equally effectively.

However, the film wouldn't be as satisfying if its villains weren't so detestable and Bob Gunton & Clancy Brown really excel in that department. They're monstrous with absolutely zero redeeming qualities in a way that isn't cartoonish or overly played. It's a very human evil.

Frank Darabont's direction never loses sight of the humanity at this film's core and with perfect cinematography from Roger Deakins, it finds beauty in the darkest of places. Darabont's writing is phenomenal as well, the dialogue is iconic for a reason, so emotionally open and deep without the slightest hint of pretension or saccharine.",10
"Not much to say that hasn't been said. Great acting, character development, and plot. It's the ultimate story of overcoming adversity. Movies like this aren't made anymore and it is saddening.",10
"The is the best movie of all time IMO.

It's the type of story where you can get lost in and feel like you're actually there watching it all. It's not a fast moving movie with over-choreographed scenes and copious special effects. Instead, it's a simple story with a deep touch that everyone can relate to in some way. Then there's the hidden mystery of the escape that's going on, and you know it's going on, but you never see it hinted at until the moment it's revealed. This will keep you engaged.

The selection of relatively unknown actors aside from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, playing minor but pivotal roles magnificently adds to the genuine feel of the story and the feeling of being there in the moment.

No surprise that this is often regarded the greatest movie of all time.",5
"A man is sent to prison and has to learn to adapt to prison life,, there he meets a wise old gentleman who he befriends, and there friendship grows immensely. along the way he meets different prison characters, all of which are very likable... adapted from a short short by Steven King,, this is a powerful movie,, showing prison life in the early 20 th century. Tim Robbins was wonderful in this and should have won an award,, Morgan freeman is captivating in his role as ""Red"" , Our main character, Andy Dufrene plans a prison break and needs the help of several of the inmates.. I wont' say what happens after his attempted prison break,, but this is a touching movie, with a lot of character development, and not much on the action,, but it really doesn't need to have a lot of action,, lot's of humor abound, a movie about growing up in person, and the people that you might, and the life struggles of being in prison,, excellent movie.. but not the greatest of all time,,, I can think of at least 10 better .",10
"One of my all time favorites.It is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",7
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" isn't only a movie these days; it's a statement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped underfoot by a system they didn't understand. Yet watching the film with that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying emotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.

Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that ""salvation lies within."" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.

""Hope can drive a man insane,"" Red warns Andy. ""It's got no use on the inside."" Andy doesn't agree.

It's true what other commenters say: You can't pass two-and-a-half hours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough cleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood blockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players. Based on the Stephen King novella, ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption,"" it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the powerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who uses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.

Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast, his quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film ""Harvey"" Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing ""the guy who can get it for you"" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (""fresh fish"") is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne.

""Shawshank"" is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile, justice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too on-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true and natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details, that you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to. It's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.

But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message touches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of Shawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the idea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its belief that ""a warm place without memory"" is not out of reach pulls us in. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so inclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other levels, too.

Finally, it's a great story, well told. People will always have a need for such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine and noble as they are here. Andy wants out of ""Shawshank"" bad, but for viewers it turns out being a fine place to serve time in.",6
"My Rating : 9.5/10

'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.'

This is the thoughtful and paradoxical tagline of the prison-drama saga entitled 'The Shawshank Redemption'.

With a runtime of 2 hours and 22 minutes, The Shawshank Redemption is truly director Frank Darabont's baby. But does it serve to be a dream come true for the viewers? The answer is a resounding yes, according to me.

Though it failed miserably at the time of release it is now heralded as one of the greatest of the greatest that the medium of cinema has ever seen. It is #1 on the imdb Top 250.

It is an impressive, engrossing filmmaking masterpiece adapted from the horror prodigy Stephen King's 1982 novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as its main characters, the movie offers marvelous acting although Robbins' Andy Dufresne scores low with respect to his overall energy I feel. It almost seems artificial, bland and repetitive. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red (Morgan Freeman) is a blend of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed in his past. His friendship with Andy is the film's main highlight.

The inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style (the music and some of the cinematography) Hollywood production (Castle Rock Entertainment) is a combination of a prison-drama film as well as excellent character study. The film takes the-innocent-man-in-prison theme and gives it a new angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the film ventures down a less-travelled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars of the prison cell. As one of the character puts it : ""These walls are funny. First, you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them."" This is the case with Brooks (excellently portrayed by James Whitmore) who is completely institutionalized and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of prison represents one of the film's most moving and effective sequences.

The chiaroscuro of the entire film is incredible and of the scenes which leaves an impression on one's mind is one when Andy, after escaping from the prison, expresses his joy and freedom by looking up at the dark sky and his upward-facing hands welcoming raindrops to fall over his body.

Darabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstakingly long chess game) of friendship, hope, survival, emancipation and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.

However, on the downside, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the film deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The all-too-predictable final twenty two minutes move a little slowly and my heart goes out to Darabont who displays a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.

All in all, the film is undoubtedly great and only time will tell if it holds up another 25 or so years down the line. It's already been 24 years but I hope the future generations enjoy it just as much and not be put off by the pace and style of the narrative. 9/10.",9
"There's nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies, and there's no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. I always go for 1994, mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. I mean, it's pretty tough to find a person that doesn't have either ""Forrest Gump"", ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in their personal top ten. While the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents (to some people ""Forrest Gump"" is too much of a tearjerker, while ""Pulp Fiction"" apparently glorifies violence too much), ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. It's a movie that goes beyond matters of taste, the story, writing and acting are so undeniably good that it's tough to come up with a counterargument. Writer/director Frank Darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer, particularly when it comes to bit characters. You can also see this in the somewhat inferior ""The Green Mile"", characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. The amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do the rest. The best movie ever made? It's definitely up there.",10
"Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank 2 in the top 250, in front of LotR3, where it belongs. I've seen this movie about 20 times and I never get tired of it. That's what makes a movie the best. The first 2 in the top 250 are where they belong. The 3 LotR-movies should be out of the top 10. They should create a category for special effects. Put them on top there. But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects. The story of Shawshank is absolutely great. The actors did their best. It's still a shame, that this great movie didn't got a single Oscar. It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners.",10
"At the time of this writing ""The Shawshank Redemption"" occupies the top spot in IMDb's list of top rated films. I will state right off the bat that I don't agree with that assessment but that doesn't mean that I don't think the film is a fine one.

The story (based on a Stephen King novella) concerns a man sent to Shawshank Penitentiary after being convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Once there he undergoes many hardships but eventually befriends the resident dealer in contraband and strikes an accord with the guards and warden. However, through it all he never loses the hope that someday, somehow he'll regain his freedom.

The cast is commendable. Morgan Freeman delivered the film's best performance and landed a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process. Tim Robbins was excellent as well, giving one of the best performances of his career. The remainder of the cast is filled out by an assortment of well-chosen character actors. Of these, Bob Gunton & James Whitmore deserve special praise.

The film's production values don't disappoint either though they are undeniably not at quite the same level as the films that critics usually dub the best of all time. Frank Darabont's direction is tasteful, though, and is bolstered by Oscar-nominated cinematography courtesy of eight time nominee Roger Deakins. Thomas Newman's Oscar-nominated score has some memorable moments and provides solid support throughout.

In the end, though, while the film is indeed admirable from a technical standpoint, it is the emotional impact that has made it a favorite of so many. Naturally, emotional responses will vary from person to person but this film seems to hit the mark more than any other. Do yourself a favour and check it out.",10
"When I seen this movie in Top250, I could not believe it, thought it was a joke. It is probably some boring old movie, maybe even without colors. But I was amazed. Similar to Prison Break series, just older version of it. Adventure, Lesson, Inspiration, Motivation, Insight, Experience, Confidence, Emotions...all in one. Good ending too. It lacks nothing. It teaches us to fight for freedom, and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards, but freedom from people, diseases, poor life, anything negative or bad. It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it.",9
"Wish I could go back in time and see it for the first time again, because the story moved me deeply. Fantastic movie all the way through, not a single issue to report here.",10
"Film Review: The Shawshank Redemption (from a novel by Stephen King) The tale of the banker (Tim Robbins), who, given life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover, adapts to prison life using his native wit, as told through the eyes of another lifer (Morgan Freeman). Absorbing plot, interesting relationship between the two leads. The prison system (of Maine) exposed as brutal and corrupt, the chief guard (sadist) and the warden (sanctimonious bible basher) are particularly nasty. Setting the story between the 40s and 60s makes it a little easier to believe. Fairytale ending.

Conservatives might argue all the brutality is justified in making prison a deterrent, but that hardly excuses the murders by guards and embezzlement by the warden. Of course the same people will contend insider trading keeps the stock market efficient  laws are OK as long as they do not inconvenience entrepreneurs. What we see here is a criminal injustice system similar to that which prevailed in parts of Australia at the time (and probably still does). The public doesn't care and the politicians don't want to appear soft on crime, after all, only bad people go to prison. Actually, King accepts that some prisoners have done pretty awful things, and go on doing them in prison.

So who is being redeemed? The problem is that Tim Robbin's character is a moral and upright character who should not be in jail  he has no need to forgive himself. Most of the other prisoners seem to think they are innocent, which makes ""redemption"" hard for them. Perhaps Morgan Freeman's character eventually does, but at enormous cost. Anyway, it's a good yarn, and virtue (of a sort) does triumph, which is always cheering.",9
"You go into a film hoping to be entertained. That's the least you can expect. If a film manages not only to entertain but also to inspire then you've really got something. Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption. Few movies are as inspiring and uplifting as this tale of...an innocent man rotting away in prison? Well that doesn't sound particularly inspiring. Sounds depressing even. But this movie will surprise you. At times along the way it is rather bleak, things seem hopeless. But the movie's hero never gives up hope. He is not content to sit in prison and rot. Get busy living or get busy dying. Is there ever really any doubt which of those options Andy Dufresne will choose?

In 1947 Andy, a banker on the outside, is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary for life after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He befriends a prisoner named Red, a man popular amongst his fellow inmates because Red is the man who can get things. Most of the men want the typical prison contraband. Cigarettes are the big item. Andy's different. He wants a tiny little rock hammer to maintain his rock collection. And later he asks for a Rita Hayworth poster. As the years go by Rita becomes Marilyn, Marilyn becomes Raquel. It's as good a way as any to mark the passage of time. Time marches on. The world moves on. But the men of Shawshank are left behind. That would be hard enough to take even if you were stone-cold guilty, a menace to society. For an innocent man like Andy Dufresne? You wonder how he cannot be utterly defeated by life. Yet somehow he maintains a sense of calm and a great inner strength. There's something about this guy.

What exactly is it about Andy Dufresne? Hard to say because the story is never really told through his eyes but rather through those of his friend Red. We come to know Andy only to the extent that Red does. And for this story that setup really works. Tim Robbins is excellent in the role of Andy, the film's hero figure, but Morgan Freeman has perhaps the more challenging job in playing Red. Freeman's character serves as the audience's eyes and ears. And he also serves as the movie's voice. Extensive use of voice-over narration in films can be an iffy proposition, often proving more distracting than helpful. But Freeman's voice, Red's voice really, narrates this story beautifully. Playing off one another wonderfully Robbins and Freeman make a terrific team. This is a movie content to let its two main characters just sit around and talk. True, there's not much else to do inside those prison walls. But some of the shared moments between Andy and Red are as poignant as any you'll see in any film and the two actors deserve their due credit for making it so.

You wouldn't go so far as to call it slow but the movie certainly proceeds at a deliberate pace. This is a story which takes its time in letting you know where it is ultimately headed. It's essentially Andy's story, as told by Red. But there is room for some other characters to carve out their place as well. Most touching is the story of elderly prisoner Brooks, as played beautifully by James Whitmore. His little story within the story definitely tugs on the heartstrings. Of course for any movie to truly succeed there has to be some conflict and for that we have guard Byron Hadley and warden Samuel Norton. At least Hadley is upfront in his evilness. Norton's one of film history's biggest hypocrites, walking around the prison spouting Bible verses all the while being engaged in all manner of unseemly activities. This is a man who needs a comeuppance. But in the world of Shawshank it is Norton who has all the power. This is a story seemingly destined for a very unhappy ending. The righteous man does not seem at all likely to prevail. But, slowly but surely, the movie continues to build towards something. What that something will be you can't quite be sure. But when the moment comes where all is revealed the film's ultimate triumph is secured. For you have seen not only an entertaining and utterly compelling story. You've seen something which can't help but make you feel better about life in general. This is a movie to see when you need to have a little of your faith in humanity restored. It may not be, as it is in some places proclaimed to be, the best movie ever made. But is an undeniably excellent movie which has rightfully become rather beloved by most everyone who sees it.",10
"Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen.

Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.",10
"An interesting movie with good performances. It's basically about hope and hold it together. It is the final outcome that matters the most.

Is about 2 imprisoned men who bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. Robbins, Freeman and the supporting cast is good enough.

I don't think it is worthy to be the #1 movie in the IMDb though. That's just not possible.

I know that ""debate"" started between TSR and TDK.

Anyway a good overall movie. especially if you are into prison dramas, then this movie is for you.",3
"Darabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a maximum security prison with a tough warden (Gunton). Andy (robbins) befriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone of the film, Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is the actor's best performance of all time. This is Freeman's film, though Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an antagonist. Everything about this film is perfect, so i can completely see why its the 3rd best film of all time on IMDb. I am a big fan and have watched it 5 times and wouldn't mind on seeing it again later down the line. IMDb Rating: 9.2 MY Rating: 10/10",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an absolute masterpiece that captivates viewers with its powerful storytelling and exceptional performances. The strength of the film lies in its compelling characters, especially Andy Dufresne portrayed by Tim Robbins and Red played by Morgan Freeman. Their acting is phenomenal and brings depth and authenticity to their roles.

While the movie is widely praised, it's important to note that it does have some weaknesses. The pacing can feel slow at times, and the length of the film may be a bit daunting for some viewers. Additionally, some critics argue that the plot is predictable and lacks surprises.

However, the cinematography is stunning, capturing the claustrophobic atmosphere of Shawshank State Penitentiary while also showcasing the beauty of hope and redemption. The music, composed by Thomas Newman, perfectly complements the film's emotional tone, enhancing the viewers' experience.

In summary, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a remarkable film that explores themes of hope, friendship, and resilience. Despite its minor flaws, the exceptional acting, cinematography, and music make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences.",10
"With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood.",10
A film directed by Frank Darabont. Starring Tim Robbins. At first I was retissant but when I knew that in this film there was this sublime actor who is Morgan Freeman. Anyone who spends time watching TV and watching movies should have seen this movie at least once in their lives. It is a great sadness for me to learn that Morgan Freeman did not win the Oscar for this film.,10
"My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. Actually, the movie itself is nothing special, but it has some good stuff. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those Croatian films that were popular back in the 1990s. My final rating comes in at seven out of 10 stars.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job, and that is saying something. Freeman is the greatest actor of all time. Secondly, Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in the end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW! It is awesome and will never be topped.",10
That was alot af time passing that I wanted to watch this film but something was avoiding me ... I do'nt know what was that but finally I decided to watch and I surprised... what a beautiful movie is this ...,10
"Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times before they get into it. And read the short story just as many times. This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if you are a fan of Stephen King's short story.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is presently the highest rated movie on IMDb. It follows a man who is wrongly accused of murder and sent to prison for multiple years because of it. The prison, Shawshank, is a prison which acts outside of the law and ends up being very brutal because of it. For the most part it's pretty deserving of its rating, but it's definitely not the best movie ever made in my opinion.

The plot of this movie is pretty great. It's interesting and somewhat unique, and it actually throws you off a little. It's a movie that isn't horribly plot-driven, but nonetheless is very interesting.

The characters are the driving force of the movie, and they were very good. They all feel pretty realistic, and the actors are all fantastic.

Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie. While I wouldn't call it the best movie ever, or even put it close to that place, it's a very well-made movie that I enjoyed quite a lot. There isn't a lot I can really say about it. Everything about this movie is great, and if I were to go any deeper I'd probably end up spoiling something. In the end I'd recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. It's a movie that you should just watch and see what you think for yourself.",9
"As someone who loves films, The Shawshank Redemption was a necessary watch. After finally being able to see it, I can say I was not disappointed at the slightest.

The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne, a young banker sentenced to two life terms in prison. There he befriends and bonds with Red, a long-term inmate.

Written and directed by Frank Darabont, this tale of hope, friendship and redemption is widely regarded as one of the best films of all time. Solidified as IMDb's highest rated film, The Shawshank Redemption has been recognised as a culturally important universal crowdpleaser. I really enjoyed The Green Mile, another Darabont feature, but I think this film is better. The script by Darabont is absolutely fantastic. The film is filled with so many memorable scenes with well-written dialogues that will move and uplift you. The characters are so beautifully presented and developed. Despite being prisoners, Darabont manages to humanises these people and make us truly care about them. Our two main characters, Andy and Red, are played marvellously by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially outstanding due to the way he interacts with others around him and how he delivers dialogues. The scenes where he's asked if he feels rehabilitated are some of my favourite in the film as Freeman's acting in conjunction with Darabont's writing make the scene as powerful as it can be. I loved the development of Andy and Red's friendship. It was executed very well and I felt like I had a personal connection with them throughout the time they were in prison.

Despite having such a simple premise, Frank Darabont is able to bring out such a powerful message about hope. The film doesn't lose sight of this theme and it's brilliantly woven throughout the story and makes a lasting impact as the film reaches its climax. He has a particular style of telling the stories he's making which manage to create a deep and emotional impact on the audience. There were points where I was reminded of The Green Mile. The film is gorgeously shot. The aerial shot of the towering Shawshank prison with Thomas Newman's amazing score playing in the background is one of the best. Newman's score landed an Oscar nomination which I found to be well deserved. His score is beautiful to listen to. It has such an uplifting tone to it that can easily generate an emotional response from the audience.

The Shawshank Redemption was an incredible experience. The performances by Robbins and Freeman are oustanding and Frank Darabont really showcased his capabilities here as a writer and director. He's made a beautiful and heartfelt film that leaves a long-lasting smile on your face.",9
"This film is, love it or hate it, flawless. I find myself unable to pick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or inconsistent. The Director, Frank Darabont, despite his much-less-than-impressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail. Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplay.

Originally published under Richard Bachman, Stephen King's once-pseudonym, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history. The book makes no attempt to build or define characters, background, or story progression. It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book: as hopeless as a man's situation is, his dreams and fantasies live on. After King's catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages later.

Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting 95% of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe. Credit where credit's due, Stephen King doesn't even deserve royalties.",6
"Everyone talks about the ""best ever"". But how can you Judge the best? Shawshank is one of those movies that is one of those ""the best film ever"". It has all the elements that make it stand out fro the rest. Morgan Freeman makes this film, his acting and more importantly, his voice in the narrative. The 'critics"" wrote this movie off; what do they know? This is one of the best movies of all time, and there are some awesome creations to stand up amongst. Shawshank is a legend of the movie world.",10
"That you want a sequel.

I didn't want it to end and I never say that. This is the first one where I said, 'More Please.'

The acting, screenplay, lesson it imparts and ending are perfect.

Ignore my review however. Go watch a bunch of remakes and gender switches, franchise boys.",3
"Stephen King's powerful prison drama story is brought to life, with Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"". The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her affair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer ""Red"", portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks about Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an excellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a true miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan Freeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as ""Brooks"", the Shawshank librarian. Also, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect cinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular script. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me wanting for more. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the best movies ever made, and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before, even though of it's slow 142 minute run-time. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", in my review, ""a stunning masterpiece, entertainment at its finest"".",10
"This is another of those films that inexplicably gets the reputation of being the best film ever made and a kind of rabid mass psychosis by suggestion seems to result. I'm amazed at the number of times this turns up whenever people do a top ten list. Unfailingly, like the proverbial black penny, up it pops. Yawn. I think kids need to be forcefully tied to a chair and made to watch some film history. Why on earth does every single thing Stephen King inflicts on the reading public have to be made into a film? They'll be making his shopping list next. It would be okay if he was an interesting author but the majority of what he turns out is handed down pulp detritus. This film is a staggering three hours long and full of cliched bathetic corn although freeman does his best. Robbins is an average actor and his character is a cypher at best. The plot is very silly. Are they really trying to tell us that no one would check a very prominent item in a cell for fifteen years? There must have been a lot of noise filtering through and a draught which would rattle it like mad. I'm sure that's the first place they'd check behind for a marijuana stash. And didn't prisoners get moved around regularly from cell to cell? The come-uppance of the staff was hugely unlikely too, destroying any poignancy and good will the film may have stirred up earlier. It was daft stuff. And we mustn't forget the old stalwart of hack directing, the thunderstorm to highten...well, I don't know what really, it's hard to see with all that flashing. I suspose it's stirring for some to see a crane shot of a man holding his arms to the heavens. It's a highlight of their lives. I call it film making by numbers. And there are a lot of numbers in this film. It's one virtue is it doesn't duck prison rape.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by Stephen King. Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well. Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen. The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142 minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few flaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that can't be missed. It has a compelling story, character development, drama, some humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Robbins and Freeman) who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie. Well done. Much better than expected.",8
"Wow! All the good reviews about this movie have already been said, saying something else will be repetitive but watched this movie when I was just 11 years old, barely understood the whole plot. This movie just go re-released in 4K today (14/09/2021) and I bought it to add to my digital library collection and after watching it for real this time I'm totally speechless... Just get this movie, no more comments. This is EPIC👌🏾",10
"The Shawshank Redemption :-

Classic Prison Break Movie.

Worth Watching .

9.3 in IMDB Worth for its Hype and Ratings .

Fast Paced Movie . Intriguing.

Interesting Dailogues .

Pre Climax Scenes were 🔥🔥🔥🔥.",10
"This movie is annoying in several ways. The criminals are all goodhearted, thoughtful, sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys. gimme a break. What is this? Dukes of Hazard? (which was far better than this). Further, the plot is so, so, so predicable. Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served. spare me. I know, a lot of people love this flick, but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time.",10
"This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again. Each time I see it, I learn more and more. Like figuring out the joke about ""salvation lies within."" I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy. It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within. This movie has everything a movie needs. It makes you laugh, cry, and feel really good, giving you a feeling of hope.",10
"I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film. Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry, but I found it utterly average. I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie. Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was. Sorry.",10
"This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over your face, hope is still your last hope.

One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What would you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well, Andy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he weren't in this movie, the movie would have lacked something for sure.

There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.",10
"I have to admit that I've discovered the existence of this movie by looking to the top rated movies on IMDb and this one has the highest rank of all the films ever made. I was clearly curious, why so high? Why this movie in particular is the best according to the other IMDb's users? Well after watching it I can say that it's not something wrong to have The Shawshank Redemption so high. It's not my favorite film ever but it's a very very good one that I'll suggest everyone who didn't see it to go and watch it. This movie is great in every aspect: performances, direction, plot, settings... But what makes it so great is that it provokes a lot of emotions in the viewers that stay with them for a while after the viewing. There are a lot of powerful moments and scenes and they are all well built in order to have more impact. And furthermore the movie is also able to stimolate a reflexion about various topics about prisons system, justice and human nature in general. In conclusion The Shawshank Redemption is clearly a must-watch, don't lose this masterpiece.",10
"One of the best movies ever,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were so good.",10
"Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. As you've come this far and you're a bit of a film fan you go to see a film you've heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago, with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not been moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny Corleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were either plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or happy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed, respected or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.

Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.

This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony, I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. I have seen it many times and will see it many more.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption.The best movie i have seen yet.Its adapted from a novel by Stephen King but this is a special film even better than the novel i suppose.Best adaptation yet to walk through in International Cinema.

The great camaraderie between Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman is very difficult to surpass.Wow!!What an on screen display by both of them. If Robbins was fantastic then Morgan was emphatic.Brilliant acting by Tim Robbins.The best by him so far.Even he would admit.Morgan Freeman comes out with an en-lighted performance.His dialogs in the film are truly inspiring & heart aching.Fantastic work by him.An epitome of performance by Morgan Freeman.The rest of the casting is good.James Whitmore as Brooks is a revelation,so is Bob Gunton as the warden.

The plot is superb.Ending is classy.You can never make out what happened in the end.Its such a travesty that you have to watch it again.The directorial of Frank Darabont is top stuff whereas the screenplay by him is very much adulated.The dialogs are so memorable you will always carry them along.Here are some of the best dialogs from this:

Andy Dufresne: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.

Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.

Andy Dufresne: That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you... Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

This movie is the epitome of all others.No movie can emulate the camaraderie between that of those two Shawshank Prisoners.Must watch for a fabulous & thrilling experience.",10
"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free – These words inscribed on the poster of The Shawshank Redemption sum up what's at stake in Frank Darabont's chef-d'oeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption shows us that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison.

Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)is a prominent banker wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her paramour, who spends many years in the Shawshank prison. He forges an unforgettable friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, who helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life. While the prison walls shield Red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an ever-changing world, it has the exact opposite effect on Dufresne, who exploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside world to himself and his fellow convicts. Their bond forms the backbone of the film.

Tim Robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating portrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate humanity to Stephen King's principal character. Freeman is exceptional as Red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions.

Frank Darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an astonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that I thought had been dead since The Great Escape. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, masterfully told. The film's greatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that might have felt slushy, achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed wonderment.

The Shawshank Redemption warrants repeated viewing!",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American film directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The film is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King.

The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and moving story about hope, friendship, and the human spirit. The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongly convicted of murder and sent to Shawshank Prison. Despite the harsh conditions of the prison, Andy befriends fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, and the two form a close bond. Over time, Andy uses his intelligence and cunning to survive in prison and eventually orchestrates a daring escape.

One of the strongest aspects of The Shawshank Redemption is the amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Robbins portrays Andy with great empathy and sensitivity, capturing his struggle and resilience in the face of adversity. Freeman is equally impressive as Red, bringing a warmth and humanity to the character that is truly inspiring. The chemistry between the two actors is exceptional, and they bring a depth and complexity to the film that is truly captivating.

The film's direction by Frank Darabont is also noteworthy, with beautifully shot scenes and tight pacing that keep the audience engaged throughout. The cinematography is stunning, with carefully crafted shots that evoke a sense of isolation, oppression, and hope. The film's soundtrack is also excellent, with a haunting score that perfectly captures the mood and tone of the film.

The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and moving film that is a must-watch for fans of drama and character-driven films. With its excellent performances, stunning direction, and emotionally charged storyline, this film is sure to leave a lasting impression on its audience. I highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption to anyone looking for a film that is both thought-provoking and deeply moving.",10
"What can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a spectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does what he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a voice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the tale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison and has nothing but hope to cling on.

Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every scene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out. With colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly become personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison for something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from imagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when stripped from their freedom and rights.

There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot. Shawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which could or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done to perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put into the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra special.

Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already been critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any harm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film doesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a story must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is that Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in a fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll down on this extraordinary tale",2
"Cons : This movie is kinda very slow-paced, but it might fit its nature and its plot.

However, this should not be the first movie of all time, because it , as a matter of fact, isn't. The Godfather, for instance, deserves the title.

From an other perspective, it's kinda unfortunate to not see Red playing the Harmonica, that would have been a good part too...

I can see the whole ""Brooks"" arc a waste of time, that could've been shrunk within very few minutes.

Halas ! Few more cons would be stated , but I'd go with the pros : A movie that beats all expectations, so is the plot, and so does it, because whenever you see a scene , you expect something, but it goes otherwise.

The ending is really good, few movies manage to strike the bullseye when it comes to endings. The Shawshank redemption did the job fortunately, and it delivered.

The plot's exciting-radiation was on its climax with the last quarter of the movie.

Worth 8 and not 9.3.",9
"Well the thing with this movie is its message. While it might not be the first or only prison break movie, the way it's directed and its amazing cinematography and score has turned this average plot movie into a great movie. The dialogues are superb, mostly short and on-point! And the cherry on the cake is Morgan Freeman( specially his voice).

It's a timeless movie that you'll re-visit time and time again and you'll watch the complete movie and protagonist's struggle just to get to that light of hope in the climax. Couldn't agree more on the fact that it must have been the most revisited movie of all time... And isn't that enough to make it the best movie of all time?",10
"An outstanding movie about perseverance, brains and irony. It's certainly the greatest prison movie ever made. But there's a lot more involved than your average prison flick has to offer. Try character and character development for starters.

The best thing King has written, I love ""Salems Lot"" but how can you top this one.",9
"To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't believe how good it was. I expected a film that would pass the time by, and I got a film that I could identify with. If you are feeling sad, and you think the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope. I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.

The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good.

The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better, things might change for us, and hope never dies.

I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it away, because it's in your head. If I have a rubbish day at work, then it's true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.

This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live). This will live in my memories forever, not like the sorry cash-ins of movies.

This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film.",10
"At first, before starting the movie, I thought ""Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie"". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie ""The Last Castle"" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.

It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...

The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!

A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor.",10
"One of the masterpieces of Stephen King that became another memorable masterpiece for movies (and one of the most underrated films by the Academy).

""Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most magnificent and beautiful films ever made, is not the first time that another work of Stephen King becomes a must see classic. Thanks to Frank Darabont, the film became unforgettable and also thanks to the magnificent history. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a simple and shy bank worker, who after seeing his wife with her lover, he threats to kill her. His wife and her lover show up dead in the next day and Andy is sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank institute where begins his great life story when he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and a strong friendship starts between this two during the long years of imprisonment. Andy manages to bring many benefits to the prison and the prisoners, but only later that Andy discovers that his arrest was all a ""misunderstanding.""

The strongest points of the film is the screenplay of Darabont writing and detailing the film with greater mastery possible by putting us in the place of Andy and get us feeling the tightness and claustrophobia of prison. But at the same time with a very well-constructed dialog that narrates the film without blemish and without leaving any loose end, leaving the story and his final message in greater perfection. A story that teaches the value of friendship and strong at the same time of hope, one of the beautiful things in life and that we can never abandon it or forget it.

Not only the story is absolutely amazing and without any flaws, but the performances of each of the cast stand out, Morgan Freeman being perfect as in all his roles. But who stands out is definitely Tim Robbins with a show of perfection while maintaining its character as it is, shy and who keeps to himself and does not try to be anything more than that.

A film that is undoubtedly magnificent, a true masterpiece that should be watched over and over again to witness this spectacle emotionally breathtaking classic.",2
"I know 'Best Movie Ever' sounds like such a cliché, a phrase used to death. Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever. I believe that the phrase ' Best Movie Ever' should be reserved for one movie only. The Shawshank Redemption. Not so long ago on IMDb, The Shawshank Redemption was ranked 2nd. This, naturally, compelled me to buy it, and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movie.Simple plot, wonderfully acted and directed.Since watching The Shawshank Redemption, i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it. And here i must do the same. It is ranked #1 on IMDb for a reason. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it. If you haven't seen it, watch it.10/10",6
"What to say about this movie. I still regret not watching it after several recommendations. This is a complete masterpiece. All the actors have done great job.

Now talking about the movie it has a very deep message. It says hope is the thing a man should always have. Fear can hold you a prisoner but hope can set you free. And being free doesn't mean freedom from prison, but from negative thoughts that brought you down here. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shared a great bond of throughout the movie and we really do care about them. It is a masterpiece and one must watch it at least once in his/her life....",10
"FILM: 10/10.

In my humble opinion, The Shawshank Redemption stands tall as the greatest film of all time. It's a masterpiece that seamlessly blends brutal reality with heartwarming hope. Frank Darabont's exceptional direction shines through in every scene, marking a stunning debut for his first theatrically released film.

The casting and performances are absolutely perfect. Each actor fits their role like a glove, making the characters feel like real individuals. The adaptation of Stephen King's short story is brilliantly executed, capturing its essence while adding cinematic depth. And let's talk about that score by Thomas Newman - it's nothing short of stellar, enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative.

Brutal, heartbreaking, uplifting, and even funny at times - it's rare for a film to encompass such a range of emotions, but Shawshank does so effortlessly. It artfully depicts individuals at their lowest points, teetering on the edge of despair, only to reveal that glimmer of determination in their eyes, a testament to the human spirit's resilience.

Morgan Freeman's captivating voice-overs draw you into the story, and the dynamic between him and Tim Robbins is flawless. However, my attention invariably gravitates towards James Whitmore's portrayal of Brooks. His scenes outside of Shawshank are cinematic treasures, tugging at the heartstrings with sheer perfection.

The film's leisurely pace allows for a deep connection to the characters and their journeys. It's an absolute masterclass in filmmaking, showcasing the power of storytelling and visual artistry. I never tire of watching The Shawshank Redemption, as it remains a timeless gem that continues to resonate.

Overall, The Shawshank Redemption isn't just a movie; it's an experience that lingers long after the credits roll. Darabont's direction, the impeccable cast, the moving score, and the emotional depth make it a true cinematic triumph. This film has it all - a riveting narrative, memorable performances, and an enduring impact. It's not just a perfect film; it's an example of what film can achieve at its best.

"This is one of those films that come once in a blue moon. The ones that leave you sitting on your seat staring at the screen when the film is ended and trying to think of a word to describe the excellence of the film

Although Shawshank does take a while to get started, but you understand why later on the film. The characters need to be explained for you to understand later points in the film.

What really makes this film great is the use of no special effects, no stunts, just plain simple amazingly original,witty story writing and outstanding acting by every character in the film including the minor ones. Just based in a prison, men talking to each other.

This film does make you feel involved in the film. You feel every characters emotions and pain and share their joy and happiness. When the film ends it takes you 10 seconds to get back to reality again - its just that compelling

Best personal Film of all time and best film on IMDb and rightly so Spectacular Film !",3
"From the same book that brought us Stand By Me and Apt Pupil comes The Shawshank Redemption. If you haven't read this book (Different Seasons), you'd better go buy it. And if you haven't seen Apt Pupil (very underrated movie) go rent it.

A couple things about this movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best out there. When I read the novella, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' I had never thought that Red was a black man. Maybe he wasn't which just goes to show what a great story and movie this was. IT DIDN'T and IT DOESN'T MATTER that he's black or not. The other thing was that I kind of wish I HADN'T read the story first. Knowing how it was going to end spoiled it a little, not too much because the girl I saw it with was 100% totally surprised when the hole in the wall was discovered. So at least I had that prior knowledge over her. haha!

Even though I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 here at IMDb, I'm surprised it's doing battle with The Godfather and Schindler's List for the #1 position here.",7
"It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart.",10
"Let me tell you a little story. I am 17 years old and consider myself an avid movie buff. From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindler's List to The Matrix, I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies. After being desensitized by the poor gore-fest known as Hostel, I came home and watched this movie with some friends. Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up. I don't do it often, and I certainly wasn't expecting to tonight. But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul. It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time. Please go see this in its entirety if you have not.",10
"No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. In the shawshank redemption, andy dufresne (tim robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with red (morgan freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc. All in 19 years.

Only grossing about 70 million in the box office, the shawshank redemption is the best example of ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" the movie accurately portrays the cruelty and brutality of life in prison by highlighting the struggles and suffering of every prisoner in different circumstances. As a result, it came across as very sentimental and moving. In addition to that, the determination to adapt is stressed on in this movie. If you ever need reassurance on the fact that all obstacles can be overcome, this movie is exactly what you need. It portrays the cliché ""nothing is impossible"" motto better than any movie has ever done.

Other than the message of the movie, the acting was phenomenal. Tim robbins gave a truly inspiring and intelligent performance. In prison, robbins's character becomes friends with red (morgan freeman), who also gives us an amazing performance. These 2 show us the importance of friendship with their inseparable bond that can be detected from the very first scene, which also helps them survive day-to-day life in prison.

With a limited set, director and writer frank darabont showed us what good writing really is. His use of irony and symbolism in the movie is like icing on cake. The movie also included shocking plot twists and an even more shocking resolution which resulted in a beautiful ending.

Nominated for 7 academy awards, this film might be the best that never won an oscar.

Score:9/10.",10
"Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge...",5
"TSR is a movie about prisoners searching for freedom. This movie contains many good acting, good story, and good cinematography. Altough it cant stand among superior classic movies, but it is prudent to tell TSR is a complete package of entertainment. TSR is a core of prison-escape genre.

This movie is an art of philosophy.",10
"I'm not going to go in detail about the brilliance of the Shawshank Redemption; it would be too much and the most haas already been said. For me,it is a tie between this and 1960's Psycho as the best movie ever. It does what nearly no movie does. It climbs through your skin, into your soul. If you have watched it already, go watch it again and if you have not, go buy yourself a blu ray and watch it. There's nothing more to say about it. If there was ever a 11/10 movie, the Shawshank Redemption would be this movie.",2
"I've watched great movies. The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Lawrence of Arabia, The Mummy (1999), The Green Mile, Silence of the Lambs, E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc. Inasmuch as they are outrageously great, none of them come close to this absolute masterpiece.

In a world where there's so much despair, so much crime, so much death and destruction, you would think there's no light at the end of the tunnel. But nope. This movie reminds us that, despite the trials and tribulations we face everyday, there's one thing that cannot be toppled.... HOPE.

""To live without hope is to cease to live."" - Fyodor Dostoyevsky ""Get busy living.... or get busy dying!"" - Andy Dufresne

This movie, in my own opinion, is the greatest movie of all time.",9
When I first saw this film I wasn't that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice it's Symbolism. The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice. Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy Dufranse.This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics.,10
"I'm one of those repetitive mucks who'll watch the same movie every weekend for three months or until I feel I've had enough. Shawshank is one of those films I have seen at least ten times and yet, it is still new. The truth is, you're never really immune to the human drama portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both excellent here. This is not a feel-good Friday night flick. It's about injustice, desperation, the overcoming of that desperation, and the will to live regardless of time or circumstance. Shawshank set no records at the box office and was largely ignored until gradually, it was recognized as the masterpiece it undoubtedly is. Roger Ebert attributes the movie's financial flop to its unassuming name.

I noticed the film is right at the top of the IMDB's Top 250 films list, and rightfully so!!! Some movies have one or two really glorious scenes. But Shawshank is one continuing memorable scene. There is not one line of stale dialogue or awkwardness. I can't do it justice here, so do yourself a favor and rent it NOW.",7
"The Shawshank Redemption isn't, in my opinion, even in the top 50 greatest films of all time, let alone number 1.

But, I can also see why it's the highest user rated film of all-time on IMDB.

This is just an all-around great movie.

The themes of triumph in the face of adversity and believing the impossible are easy to digest, and the actors give emotional, Oscar-worthy performances.

Even if this movie isn't your favorite, it's hard to objectively find fault with any one element of The Shawshank Redemption.

It's safe, but it's still for adults. It leaves you feeling good at the end. It takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. Its characters are complex. It appeals to every type of viewer on some level. It's phenomenally acted.

This classic is rated higher than any other movie on IMDB because it manages to capture general audiences in a significant way, and it stays grounded with a focus on characters and relationships during hardships.

It's not my favorite movie. Not even close. It didn't leave the same impact on me as other films.

But I genuinely enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption, as does everyone. And I think that's the key.

9/10.",10
"Lets say things, Tim Robbins gave one of the best acting performances of all time. As well as Morgan Freeman and every other actors. Let's just talk about Bob Gunton! His role sticked so much, every time i see him in other movies i can't stop thinking about The Shawshank Redemption! All the characters are so well portrayed that you feel anger, happiness and sadness about them. The simplicity of the scenes and all the little things that makes them special is priceless. The music is great. It succeeds in showing the sadness of society, the evil greedy mind of people, the good hart of other and the happiness of living free. It also portays that hope can drive us really far, even if we are prisoners. Even if this movie is not my number one, it surely deserves the number one spot on IMDb.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film. The last fifteen minutes are so wonderful it made me cry - and the only other film that has made me cry is the climax of The Truman Show. This is a film that makes you see life in a completely different way - a hopeful way. Don't watch some shallow nonsense like Mission Impossible II, watch a film that you'll remember your entire life. Watch The Shawshank Redemption. It's got 9 out of 10 for a reason, you know.",10
"In fairy tales characters are straightforward good or evil, so that the audience does not get confused. Shawshank is the sort of prison where convicts are ""good"" and guards are ""evil"", so that you know immediately who to root for.

The main characters in the movie are Andy and Red, respectively played by Robbins and Freeman. Robbins is an actor with a natural creepiness that cannot be neutralized even by the most positive role. We are supposed to root for Andy, but the ambiguity about his guilt is kept going two thirds into the movie and does not help to establish him as a sympathetic character. Freeman is by now a stand-in for God. He conveys gravitas and righteousness, even to a murderer. He deserves a happy ending against all odds.

The story unfolds extremely slowly, with the usual bonding and strife among inmates and abusive guards stirring the mix. The only plot twist is an absurd conversation between Andy and the prison's warden. In possession of vital information about his case, allegedly clever Andy chooses to share it with the evil warden, rather than with his lawyer. This is clearly an idiotic decision, but so far looks like nobody noticed.

However, the simple tale of a man convicted for a double murder, taking place almost exclusively within the prison walls is hardly material for a masterpiece. Even more so when based on a Stephen King novel. King may be massively famous, but subtle he is not.

I guess the reasons for the huge popularity of this movie lies exactly in its simple structure and exploitation of basic emotions and human qualities such as endurance, hope, faith and integrity.

The main message of a film is an even more basic ""Everything is going to be alright"". That is, if you consider decades spent in prison as a metaphor for life.",10
"Absolutely the most movie overrated i have seen .. There are movies that deserve this rated and have not been talked about.. As for this movie, it is worth watching, but it does not deserve this rating.",10
"Enough has been said of this masterpiece, so I'll keep my review succinct. This truly is my favorite movie of all-time, because no matter how many times I see it, I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect; from the cinematography, to the acting, the casting, the writing...everything. It's a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it, you just know that every scene is classic; so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything, it just keep getting better with each time I see it. I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.",10
"Best movie of all time for a reason, even after more than 20 years nothing have come close to it.",10
"In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film ever made. The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to perfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is designed to make you think, and boy does it do its job.

The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way it cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be proud that a film like this originated from his book.

The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie. I don't think anyone could give it lower than a 7. The film will appeal to anyone, if not everyone, and will leave you vey satisfied long after the credits roll.",10
"I do not know, what to say, I am just bored. Many people say that is the best Movie? False",10
"I really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first time, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded me, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman classic.

I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally much more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't match Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen - in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't give him the chance that Steve had.

Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the ""original"" too, it's not old-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge differential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon.",10
"There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I don't care what anyone's take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.",7
"Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in one of the best movies ever made",10
"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.

It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity.

It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.

And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery.

Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different.

If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.

An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.",10
"It is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks that should appear to be by independent contributors. That's why i had to laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie on IMDb. But since there would be little sense in making such an effort to generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews for a movie made in 1994 i assume this is genuine.

In any case, based on Stephen King's novella, The Shawshank Redemption was an alright prison movie to watch. However, it displays what i see as typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy or horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different. The events might have been based on actual events, but i haven't been convinced.

Obviously when you make any kind of list, there will always be a first place. On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption.",8
"it is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule , and its really worth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon, but in this film I've seen just so, I said it deserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have really found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display, but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century, and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.",10
"I enjoyed this the first time I saw it. But then again I was only an easily impressionable 14-year-old, craving for new emotion. Recently, more than 10 years later, I revisited it, and barely managed to finish it. Bluntly, it's as plain and trite as it gets. In fact, I believe Frank deliberately wanted it that way, so that it would increase its appeal to the casual movie goers. In general, I have no problem with a simple, feel-good movie that does not take itself too seriously and is not looking to change its audience in a profound way. However, this does and it seems it is succeeding unfortunately....

We have a story about hope and its redemptive qualities, portrayed by an innocent man that is sent to prison(Tim's character). It's told through the eyes of his closest prison friend(Morgan's character). The narrative framing and flow are rigid, there is no rhythm, no ebb and flow, no metaphors, no irony, just constant relentless narration - extreme simplicity. It's stripped to the point that you can only remember the generic message. Dangerous stuff. Some people carry it around and ""apply"" it diligently. The others only observe the snowball effect.

I hope there are more intelligent endeavors out there. I hope everyone sees them and appreciates them. I hope...

1/5 - Skip this, if you are over 15. There is no art here - almost no contribution to the art of filmmaking and storytelling.",10
"I was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. Morgan Freeman's narration was awesome. Tim Robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a superb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don't think! Just watch & savour it.

I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: ""Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales don't come true. It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.

In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It's about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red say, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do. They're too busy living.""

Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film; Believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don't hate this after viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. I'm POSITIVE it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If not, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies everyone and I really don't care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside Top250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings!

Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of HOPE.

9.8/10

P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars 4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages.",10
"What's going on here? At the moment I am writing these words The Shawshank Redemption is 3rd in IMDb's all-time top250. I don't think the movie is particularly bad, but to rank it even in the Top50 is a crime against a lot of brilliant film makers further down the Top250 and even more people whose works don't even appear on the list!

So now I ask if anybody can please explain to me: 1) Why is this movie's average rating over 9? Does it appeal to some basic American sense of justice and love of happy endings? 2) Why did more than 65.000 people rate it? I'm pretty sure it wasn't nearly as commercially succesful as The Lord of the Rings or the Godfather with about 50000 votes. Did it do well on video in the US?

And if you REALLY feel like watching movies about people behind bars why not give Cool Hand Luke or the 1974 classic(!) Caged Heat a try?

I don't mean to demean The Shawshank Redemtion or anything, but I just don't get it's massive rating. Is this one of the most overrated movies of all time? Well, according to the statistics of this, the odds are that you do not think so. But would you then please be so kind as to explain it to me. Feel free to email me.",6
"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact.",10
"This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentiment

tossed in. I really don' t understand the fuss. I guess some people

look for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling, palatable material

like this. That's the only explanation I've got for the unwarranted

popularity of this flick. Production credits are fine enough, as is the

acting but it certainly doesn't belong on any repsectable list of

greatest films of all time.",10
"The first thing that really struck me after watching Frank Darabondt's THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION was how much it resembled parts of the plot, but most of all the feel of John Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN. What is THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really about? Yes, it's about a hellish prison, it's about how corruptible some human beings can be, it's about the good and the bad and the ugly of humanity, it's about depression, it's about yearning for belonging, it's about hope but most of all (like of MICE AND MEN), it's about one, truly glorious friendship. I do (of course) refer to the brilliant and heartwarming bromance shared by one Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and one Red (Morgan Freeman). It's their tale of friendship and sacrifice that takes place in the living hell that is Shawshank prison and their brutally honest story is brought, magnificently to the screen by Frank Darabondt.

Every, single, vital element of this film is done to cinematic perfection: the writing, the directing, the cinematography, the scoring and of course the acting. All these elements are executed perfectly and the story is told with poignant, brutal, raw honesty. It makes you immediately stop and think about the days when ""prison"" meant prison and how if you went down, you were as a good as dead. We see this by the horrendous cruelty that Andy experiences at the hands of the brutal Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), the vile, rapist inmate Bogs (Mark Rolston) and finally, by the black hearted and truly evil, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton). We see men, in short, treated and brutalised like animals. We see men suffering from utter hopelessness and depression but still trying to build a life around their grieving situation. However, we also see the lighter side of things and this is where the film is most moving; we see people making a working environment in prison and how they carry hope with them (some, more than others) and try their best to live a productive life in a harsh environment.

Darabondt brings this to life epically; he directs perfectly, getting the uttermost from his cast and pulling everything together marvellously, he writes powerfully, breathing real life to each character and clearly marking out the heroes and villains. He makes you feel about each and every character and you end up truly caring about their hopes and dreams for the future. Like I said, this film (I believe) owes much to OF MICE AND MEN and as we focus on Andy and Red, (I think) you can appreciate how much they both resemble George and Lenny. They care and love each other almost like brothers and share a wonderful dream of someday escaping their current hell and living the dream. Sound familiar? He is a truly talented writer and with the script, as well as being able to make you shocked, horrified and sad, he can also make you laugh, make you happy and make you charmed as you behold the lighter side to the life in Shawshank. In short, Darabondt pulls together a truly marvellous piece of cinema that captures the inner turmoil and quest for hope and peace of the human spirit.

However, Darabondt's brilliant directing is not the only great thing about the film. The cinematography in this film was simply breathtaking, courtesy of the great Roger Deakins. I always love the poetic way in which Deakins tells a story with the camera. It feels poetic and mystical: the way in which the camera flies over the prison inmates, Andy in the sewage pipe, Andy in the rain and the beaches around the Atlantic Ocean. Wether it's BLADE RUNNER 2049 or SICARIO, Deakins captures the spirit of every story he films perfectly and is a true artist with the film camera.

Another great thing about the film is the score, courtesy of Thomas Newman. It builds throughout the film with a combination of soft piano and strings. His composing is filled with such poignant emotion and poetry and it really struck me how much this score resembled his work for Sam Mendes's 2002 thriller ROAD TO PERDITION. In both films, the score lifts each scene and makes the film powerful and poignant. Finally, the true brilliance of the film (or, when you think about it, any film) lies with its cast. The cast for this film was truly magnificent with some of the 20th centuries finest actors giving it their 110%! The main standouts are (without a doubt) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Robbins is powerfully poignant and moving as the movie's wronged hero. He steals every scene as his face paints pictures of sorrow, regret, depression and gentle optimism. He makes you feel so much for the character and you almost feel as if you're going through life in Shawshank with him. Put it this way: his performance in this film couldn't be further from his performance in something like THE HUDSUCKER PROXY! Morgan Freeman was also frankly masterful in this film as he shows what a truly talented actor he is. His portrayal of a worn-out but kindhearted individual is heartwarming and sincere but also his methodical, poetic, poignant, and now famous narration is truly marvellous. The story is really lifted with his virtual fairytale narration and to quote from TED 2 (as said to Freeman) ""I could go to sleep on a bed made of your voice!"" Everyone else in the film is marvellous so its hard to pick who else deserves a mention, but I think you definitely have to mention Shawshank's vile Warden Norton, played by Bob Gunton. At first, he pretends to be a firm but fair teacher with good, pure values, but as the film progresses, you see that his heart is as black as the some of the prisoners he keeps. He's ruthlessly ambitious and hides behind the facade of protector. He's truly as ""boo and hiss"" sort of villain and Gunton plays the character perfectly!

All these wonderful factors carried the film along to its shocking but wonderful conclusion. I won't spoil if you haven't seen it but I will say that the film truly ends, perfectly!

THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION captures what many films have tried to and failed: the human nature! I've seen very few films that capture the human nature in such a raw and uncompromising way. It's a truly masterful piece of cinema and probably the best 'prison movie' since COOL HAND LUKE...",9
"The key scene in The Shawshank Redemption comes when Red is confronted by Andy Dufresne with the fact that he has given up hope. ""Hope is a dangerous thing,"" says Red, and we understand, after the trials he has been through, why he can say this and believe it. And because this is such a well-crafted film, we can also see why Andy refuses to accept this philosophy, because by this time we have come to know them both so well. The movie follows the lives of these two men, who have come to Shawshank Prison at different times in their lives, as very different people. Red has been there long enough, denied parole enough times that he no longer waits for the day he will be released, but for the days he makes his pickup at the laundromat for the goods he sells to the inmates. Andy was a wealthy banker on the outside, who is sentenced to prison for killing his wife and lover in a nightmarish trial, the kind where every shred of evidence points to culpability. The movie casts doubt on his guilt long before it reveals what actually happened. In prison he faces beatings, rape and oppression, but there is some kind of redemption here, too; as the film's title suggests, this is not a joyless foray into prison life but a story about the way two different men cope with the day to day routine of incarceration, and what follows beyond it. What amazed me, watching the movie, is the the filmmakers have pulled of the tricky job of taking this material that could have been cloying and made it plausible, even meaningful. It is worth seeing just as a statement about how the choices we make in life are more important than what happens to us.",10
"I had this movie in my watch list for so many days but didn't watch it going by the title and the cover image. After watching it, I see that the movie didn't do well in box office for the same reason: strange title, unrelated cover image and confusions over marketing. But after watching it once, I want to watch it again and again. It is such an inspiration. Amazing acting and direction. Flawless, motivational and entertaining as well. Once we watch movies like this and Forrest Gump, we just feel that other scores of movies we watched is just a waste of time. Watch the movie, understand the lessons and adopt it. It surely adds value to our life, not just a couple of hours of time pass. What more: it is entertaining as well.",10
"..voice of total respect for this movie.

Everything is absolutely fantastic in this master piece. Casting, acting, photography, music, sounds, feel, atmosphere, screenplay, all that is beyond good, it is perfect. Whole movie is immersed in such a delight it really helps if you are feeling down to lift you up. And that is what movies should be all about. Not about damn effects and 3d. As many said before it really lift your spirits up. It gives such a profound feel of hope and happiness, and beyond.

And there is another great value of this movie. It proves that sometimes in this lifetime Hollywood is capable to create master piece. It is one but that one speaks for thousands of those we do not get to see. No effects, no damn computer graphics, no faster then light action scenes, and yet after watching it you feel million times better than any other movie.

It deserves 11 stars.",10
This is my favorite movie of all time. I have this movie in Physical format and I have it on digital and let me tell you that I will stop everything I'm doing if I catch it on cable. This movie has stood the test of time and each watch gets better. It has an epic feel to it. Freeman and Robbins absolutely kill it in this movie. Supporting cast is on point. The music will keep you in the moment and compliments the visuals till the very end.,7
"The great Morgan Freeman continues to spin out superlative performances. This is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a veteran convict, who is so long a part of the numbing prison culture that we're somewhat surprised by his sympathetic understanding of the unfortunate Andy DuFresne, movingly interpreted by Tim Robbins. People are in prison, for the most part, because they belong there. Prisoners don't normally exude compassion for their fellow unfortunates, but Freeman's ""Red"" noticed right away that DuFresne was of different stuff. Their friendship cut across both racial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison conducted by so corrupt a warden as Norton, was a magnificent testimony to their bond. Clancy Brown as the warden's personal storm trooper could have been reduced to caricature, but he turned this difficult role into a memorable portrayal of mindless violence. The great revelation in this film was Bob Gunton as the warden. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a keener reading of a character given the charge of men who've been reviled by society, and thus forgotten and who are totally dependent upon his good will for their very survival. Norton was the essential bureaucrat who, given sufficient backing from an indifferent public, can build from the foundations up, a system which brutalizes and murders men, and which exploits the last vestiges of their self-respect for his personal ends. The narration by Freeman in his great baritone lent an authentic base line for the kaleidoscopic unfolding of the film. James Whitmore's poignant turn as a man doomed to death outside of prison is proof of what lengthy incarceration to do to a man, turning him into a slave who is addicted to the very structure which denies his humanity. That both DuFrense and ""Red"" each managed to leap over the abysses which yawned before them, was the great cathartic experience of the film.",10
"I have just watched this movie and I still don't know what I've just seen. The way ""The Shawshank Redemption"" hit me on an emotional level was completely new to me. I was emotionally torn apart by this great piece of art. For some reason I have always avoided watching this movie because I didn't think that I'd like it as much as most people. But I was so wrong! I am in love with this movie! I have never seen such a heartbreaking and beautifully crafted movie such as this one. I fully and strongly recommend ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to everyone who still hasn't seen it. What a masterpiece! 10/10",10
"My Personal Rating 9.8/10 - This is one of the most beautiful film that i have watched, same thing on godfather the cinematography the acting the atmosphere are so beautifully crafted. this film leaves me speechless it almost change the way that i think, i do believe this movie has some lessons on it. the way Morgan Freeman narrates the movie is so beautiful.. the quotes too. i don't want to spoil anything. anyone should watch this film.",9
"Even in the worst place there is.. you can still hope for the best, dare to dream and achieve it.",10
"Stephen King is my favorite writer and I've read all of his books. When I first learned of them making a movie of ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" I was excited. I'd always liked the story, and thought it would make a great movie. But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't do the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's books. But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing. Very glad. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the very best movies from a Stephen King book ever made, and one of my favorite movies of all time. My score-10.",10
"For quite some time, I've been hearing how good The Shawshank Redemption is. But Unfortunately, I never got the chance to see it. After seeing it last week, I can safely say that the movie lives to the hype, it even exceeds it.

The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ), a hotshot banker who's convicted of murdering his wife and his lover, and who's sent to jail. In the prison, Andy meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ), a "" man who knows how to get things "". And a friendship begins between them.

There are many great aspects about the movie. I'll begin with the most obvious one, the uplifting tone. When The Shawshank Redemption ended, I was so happy I cried happy tears, I was never happier after watching a movie.

The story of the movie is so simple, yet it's very touching and effective. We spend almost half the movie watching 2 men ( Andy & Red ), talking and walking in the prison yard. Slowly we get to know them better, and in the meantime absolutely fall in love with them. I think friendship was never portrayed better in movies.

One of the best things about the movie is the acting. Morgan Freeman was never better in my opinion, Tim Robbins gave a very good performance, but I think he was better in The Player, and the supporting cast ( Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Gil Bellows ) was pretty good too.

Frank Darabont's directing is flawless. He was able to make us believe we're watching a real prison, helped in that by the great cinematography. He excelled in creating the right mood for both the uplifting scenes ( the opera scene, the library scenes ) and the depressing scenes ( the scenes with Brooks, and the rape scene ). It seems Darabont is at his best when he's making movies set in prisons, as evidenced by The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. When he tried to change that in The Majestic, the results were so-so.

So, I definitely recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption, if you haven't watched it already. This is truly one of the best movies ever made.",10
"If you are looking for an inspiring jorney to feel the magic of life, you should stop searching and watch this title.",10
"This movie is intelligent, based on an excellent book played by legendary actor as Morgan Freeman. Directed by a true artist ( Frank Darabont), I hope that this movie will be remembered for many and many years, Probably the best Picture ever made in the all history. You need to see at least one time in your life.",10
"I can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and Freeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw anything up, but they aren't spectacular.

One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at times, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have is I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for the amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is derivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is one of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly better than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that Alcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless the makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of the things stolen:

The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny irony that that entails.

The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the film to set up further encounters.

An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something and then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought that the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry, but even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The whole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was obviously a direct steal.

The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.

The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a much more important character in Shawshank, but considering how much was stolen, this certainly was too.

There are several others that I have forgotten, as I have not seen Escape from Alcatraz in quite awhile. And if Instinct had any cliché's, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the ""highly intelligent"" star, and the concentration on the ""hole"", where the star is always sent to burn for a while.

Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably watch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have not seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people became critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with Shawshank.

"Quite simply a masterpiece in storytelling. It has everything, except maybe action, but then that's not what this film is about.

Lock yourself away without distraction, and focus fully on this film, and it's only then you realise the messaging, acting skill, directing skill, pacing, everything when taken as a whole marks this film out as one of the best. Joyful, intriguing and sad in equal measure.

Faults? None. End of.

Anyone considering themselves a film buff needs to take a long hard look at themselves if this isn't in their top 10. It's in my top 3.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250 list. I don't particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the heart and soul.

The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would expect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there's something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story unfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.

The story isn't original or creative, and it's relatively simple, and a bit predictable, but it's compelling, moving, and memorable, and there's a bit more to it which I won't go into. The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the characters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances. They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned. The movie conveys this moral message very strongly, and it truly touches the heart and soul.

I am very glad I watched this movie. It is a truly emotional experience.",10
"This is a story about patience, maturity, character, salvation, and ultimately about finding humanity in a place where there is none. Although its subject matter may be depressing, the story actually contains a lot of warmth, humor and friendship - a buddy story cloaked in a philosophical discourse on the importance of retaining a sense of personal worth and hope no matter what the circumstances.

This adaptation of a 1982 Stephen King novella did lukewarm box office, in part because of an advertising campaign that offered no clue as to what the movie was about, and in part because it never played on more than 970 screens. Still it garnered seven Oscar nominations, including a Best Picture nod, and finished up at a respectable $30 million.

Set in mid-1940s Maine, this is the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is tried and falsely convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison, where he meets a canny lifer named Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and a caravan of colorful characters.

The story begins with Red and his fellow inmates watching the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red narrates the story from within the walls of the prison.

Whereas some Stephen King adapters have seemed intent on transcending or trashing their source material, writer-director Frank Darabont succeeds through fidelity to the text; the few deviations make this subdued male love story even more audience-friendly. The film sports elegant cinematography by Roger Deakins, a poignant score by Thomas Newman, solid portrayals and characterizations by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and an excellent supporting cast including James Whitmore (as old-timer Brooks Hatlen) and William Sadler as a con who starts out scary and ends up lovable.",10
"Many, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical and moving epic, but It's really not all that. It is a good movie, but it is not great or thought provoking at all. That year, 1994, was a great year for movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet people think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great' movies? Gag me.

Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)

Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor (even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch MTV's Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up? Now tell me what kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using words that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's? Freeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly bludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to prison come up with. By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant stream of corny insight I've already heard. Tell the truth now... If you saw a murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least in prison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a result of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come up in movies. Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman dropping the F, it never sounds right.

The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? Has anyone that evil ever run a prison? That is classic jail movie material. Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about glorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil. How irritating If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and being real people; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and Clyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.

Brooks  Some serious button pushing here. Brooks is a typical, lame attempt to draw out some sentiment. The bird thing is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to commit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in the country, but we can forget about that, right? The `Brooks was here' hanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite. Who hangs themselves? My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being hanged because of the shame and disrespect. Yet, Brooks hung himself when at his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course. Or better yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death on alcohol and mind-altering drugs. Almost sounds like fun, who would prefer hanging? You know who, a character in a movie. That pretty much sums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires because there is nothing genuine or authentic about it.",10
"In a world where films like The Godfather, 2001 A Space Odyssey, There Will Be Blood, Birdman exist, this above average Steven King adaptation tops the IMDb list and lowers the standards of Hollywood cinema for generations of movie viewers who only have time for what society, manifested in questionable IMDb ratings, deem ""the best films of all time"".

While a fantastic film, Shawshank Redemption does not hold a candle to 80% of the Top 100 films in this list. It is an anomaly that it attains such a high score, which is presumably to be the result of initial falsified ratings aggrandized by cinema neophytes who don't know how great movies can be. Snowball effect ensues.

There are great aspects to this movie. Morgan Freeman's acting, Roger Deakins' cinematography, Thomas Newman's score. The lead and director were relatively obscure, but they did fine. The story is as average as films of its calibre can get. While it would certainly be a highlight of the legendary year of 1994 (second greatest year in cinema behind 1999), I CANNOT comprehend the notion that it is the best film of all time. It missed out on every critics poll list.

This movie ain't that great y'all. Skip this and dig further down into the list if you want the real gems. The Godfather is truly a 10/10.",10
If stranded on a desert island I want this film to be there with me.... This film sits at the very top (with clear space) above any other film ever made.. The best of the best.. I cant remember (like most) this film coming out. I watched it like 97% off everyone else on DVD.. How this didn't get the bums on seats in the cinemas must have been a marketing balls up.. However DVD sales and now streaming services has helped this film become a favourite of many many people. Things to do in life before you die is to watch this film... not once but a few times.. this film ticks every box. Its wonderful..,10
"This movie takes you through the life of some inmates of Shawshank prison. A very moving story.

One of the best stories I've had the pleasure of seeing in a long time.

Normally, I don't go out for these types of movies (sci-fi/classic horror fan). This one really surprised me.

I actually didn't see it in the theater, but caught it on TV, then rented the movie. I've since bought it and have actually watched it a few times, which is rare for me to do. I usually watch a movie once, then not again for at least 6 months to a year.

This movie will one day be a classic in my mind.

Enjoy!",7
"In 100 years there will be 'Casablanca.' There will be 'Citizen Kane.' There will be '2001, A Space Oddessy.' There will be 'The Godfather.' And there will be 'The Shawshank Redemption.' It is amazing that this much overlooked film has in six years reached the stature of a Hollywood legend, not only in my estimation but in the opinion of almost everyone I've spoken to about it. This movie has gained a larger audience through word of mouth than it had the entire time it was in the theaters. This is quite simply one of the three best movies I've ever seen.",10
"I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

A must watch if you haven't!!!",10
"I quite like this film but it wouldn't make my top 100. The idea it's the greatest film in history is laughable.

Of course the acting's terrific. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are solid as ever, even if Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown (the Baddies) chew the scenery. And that's the problem - everything is so terribly black and white, with every character springing straight out of a three word summary. Our hero is Good But Flawed, Red is Good And Noble, the Warden is Just Plain Bad and his henchman is Reminiscent Of Another Film (okay, four words).

I've never been inside a prison, but I can't believe all the prisoners would be so damn nice. There's the ""sisters"" - a bunch of horrid rapists, of course, but they're nothing a small plot contrivance can't eliminate. The ""sisters"" aside, there's nary a cross word from a prisoner in the whole film.

Racism is also curiously absent. American prisons today are notorious hot-beds of racism. Martin Luther King's dream is bizarrely alive and well in Shawshank, where colour doesn't get a mention in twenty years of ""history"".

This total lack of realism means it's not really a film about prison at all. And what kind of ""character"" film can be centred around someone who seems entirely flawless (other than perhaps in his choice of attorney).

I can whinge about the mechanics of the film as well. Voiceover narration is irritating enough - but Red narrating events at which he was not present? Pur-lease. And that final scene - talk about a director who didn't know when to shout ""cut"". It didn't need much self control to stop at the point Red heads towards Mexico - films for grown-ups shouldn't need endings that resolve any uncertainty.

Speaking of the director, isn't it odd how the maker of the ""Greatest film in the world ever"" is also credited for The Fan, Eraser, The Blob and The Fly II? It's as if Orson Welles directed ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", or Francis Ford Copolla helmed ""Megaforce"".

I don't mean to make this out to be a bad film - it's far from that. But anyone who rates it the greatest ever should try ""Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"" - something, anything that's not so *worthy*.",8
"I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!",10
"Yes, Stephen King writes drama. He also wrote Stand By Me, The Green Mile, and Dolores Claiborne. He has definitely been typed as a horror writer, when he is an amazing tearjerker. This film is amazing. Words cannot describe just how amazing this film truly is. I thought that I would not like this film, as it looked like ""a bad sports movie"". But, when my science teacher told me I should see it, ""because it's a movie where you just go, 'wow'"". I did and I was literally in tears by the end. Not in tears of sadness, but tears of joy. Because the film was simply so beautiful. Not very many films have made me cry. Of course, I cried at the endings of Marley and Me, and Toy Story 3. But there are only 3 films I've ever cried at. Some people say Citizen Kane or The Godfather are the best movies ever. FALSE. They are overrated. This film is a diamond in the rough. Most people are stubborn and won't even take this gem into consideration. It truly is the best movie ever. The music, the direction, the cast. I won't give anything away, you need to see the film to appreciate its true beauty, but I will say that the music in this film puts John Williams to shame, and the movie reminds us that even in the most bleak of situations, life can still be great. It is a great movie because it reminds us that hope is something that nothing can quench.",3

"This film (or may be masterpiece) changed the whole outlook of mine towards life. The characters played by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were so real and so closed to my heart that I cried and I laughed with them while watching it for the first time.

We learn from books, we learn from our parents, we learn from our friends and we learn from movie like ""The Shawshank Redemption"".Once upon a time, I was going through a bad phase of my life and bit depressed also. Then some suggested me to watch this. What happened next was simply miracle. The pain endured by Tim Robbins was no less than mine. But it was hope that kept him alive. That infused a new joy in my life and I achieved success in very little amount of time. The dialogues are simply straight yet touching.

The movie has universal appeal - It can move anyone because characters played by Freeman and Robbins are so close to heart.

Double thumbs up to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for teaming up and offering this life changing piece of cinema.

This movie was not made for Oscars (although it grabbed multiple nominations) and not for critics (some critics ridicule about its number position in IMDb 250). It was made for common people like us.

Humble salute to all who were directly or indirectly associated with this all time classic.",9
"It's always difficult to choose a favourite movie out of all the movies I have seen, but I really believe that this is the one. When I first watched it, I had not read the Stephen King novella, and had no idea what was going to happen, which made it much more enjoyable to watch. Of course, like any movie, this was not flawless, but was such a terrific emotional experience for someone who is seldom moved by cinema. This was such a cinematic triumph, and I couldn't believe that it didn't win any of its seven nominations at the Oscars. The performances were wonderful, captivating the mood of the film to sheer perfection. Nothing against Forrest Gump, but it should have been easily outclassed for Best Picture. It was also a good movie, but just nowhere near as memorable as this one.",10
"I watched it a few years ago and i dont really remember the story in details, but i remember that i had i lot of emotions here and this movie give you some life lessons. Morgan Freeman is genius!",7
"This movie, is more than just a movie, this is about freedom and peace, between each other, many people will learn something watching it, about how the mind could be free when your body is not.great acting,great story and avery good script",6
It's just sublime. Never dates. Can not fault the film or actors chosen. A must watch for any one!,10
"The greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds, especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's Search for Meaning' based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces, and in that creative expression one finds meaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom – its source is within, and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead 'confine' individuals so that they become 'institutionalized'. The prison is the toughest of all institutions. But the tougher the conditions, the greater is the challenge and if understood that way, the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But until that is accomplished, one must have something essential and substantial to believe in – call it hope or faith or self esteem – in order to survive, for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same time, the idea of death itself is the motivating force – a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself – this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence, something that was hinted at in Joseph Heller's Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope (a word much abused) that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions, that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That is the true faith, not the false faith of the corrupt Warden, who in this case is not only the proverbial 'devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures' but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a 'man of God' only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated 'Greek Tragedy', as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up, and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans, in this case between two very different kind of humans, both by background as well as race, but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them 'to get busy living' rather than to 'get busy dying'. Finally, what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama, adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious, it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes – a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking.",7
"Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman's performances.

In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means in the top rank of movie making.",8
"Well, everyone seems to mention Forrest Gump in their bit about Shawshank.

So, maybe I will, too.

As a Terminator 2 fan, I feel naturally fascinated by The Shawshank Redemption. This film pushes all the buttons of a person with a caring heart.

With a brilliant cast, story line, director and set, this is a master piece rivaled only by T2, Titanic, The Rock, and perhaps Dances with Wolves.

A 8.5/10 from MaRX.",10
"What. A. Film. Incredible film. One of the best in the history, i think whit Forrest Gump the bests. Morgan Freeman's performance is amazing. 10/10",2
"There are very few films that can simply blow a human being's mind away but boy; Shawshank redemption does one hell of a job. From the very get go, Shawshank will have you on the edge of your seats.

Tim Robbins, a man whose career was on an initial down hill slide with flops such as Howard The Duck redeemed himself and then some with his portrayal of a man who looses everything in a second and then spends 20 years trying to get it all back. Robbins gave a calm misdemeanor to his character, which always gave the impression that he had something planned, that we were not expecting. Morgan Freeman gives, in my opinion the best performance of his distinguishable career. He maintains a streetwise wisdom and this, too me, makes him the ""go to guy"" of the prison. His calm yet intelligent nature is kept through out the film and does not seem affected by Andy but after the escape, Freeman does superbly in showing the contrast in the streetwise dealer of the prison to a man who misses his friend. Thomas Newman's compelling score sets a dark and ominous tone and does what many scores don't; it reflects the thought of the characters as opposed to the tone of the scene. Darabont created a diverse prison world from the street smart ones, to the homesick ones to the rapists but I was not a fan of how racism was sidestepped in the movie. If I had one nit pick, and this is scraping the bottom of the barrel; I would have expected a few racial slurs directed at some of the prisoners, particularly Red. It would have been true of the time but then again its not the point of the story.

Ultimately, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece and has a powerful yet happy enough ending to touch the heart of anybody.",10
"This movie is excellent in every way you look at it. Even the ways you don't know about it is excellent. Every time I think about this movie it makes me want to watch it again. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a performance. A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and how they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence. (It was back in the 30's, it's probably the best justice system they had). And how cruel the prison system was back in the day. 2nd all time favorite move. (1st being Platoon).",10
"I Watched the movie 16 years after its release. I must admit that i watched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. I wasn't disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie had the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an awesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!

Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that ""salvation lies within."" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.

Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It is well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such as Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins's presence works wonders for the storyline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem at peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his performance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of his lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even further with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with you long after the credits roll. His ""rehabilitated"" speech ranks right up there as one of the all-time great movie moments.

Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references (Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the impression of the passage of years, and Andy's brave, witty exploits make him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with several characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these seemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by their tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final scenes of the film all the sweeter.

Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh, the music! Thomas Newman's musical score shines brightly and lends another dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at the end is one that you've likely heard before — as it has been used in movie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank Redemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any category for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a '94 class along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I suppose it can be understood.

I will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider themselves ""movie connoisseurs"". There are not too many negatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.

I guess I'm a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending. The whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope, then you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old friends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was touching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by our excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the movie smiling instead of thinking. What I'm trying to say is that to make the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended the scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, ""I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams I hope."" And as the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll. But again, that's only an honest opinion.

Watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you involved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys watching beautiful cinema. I rate it 9 out of 10.

For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""",8
"The shawshank redemption is a must watchable movie because the storyline of this movie is brilliant and you will never feel bored a second while watching this movie, the acting done by all characters in this movie especially Red is really mind blowing.. this is a very simple, but heart touching movie, if you are a movie lover you should absolutely watch it.....",9
"Films that invoke volumous comments are either visually sensional, objects of media hype or emotionally stimulating. Shawshank Redemption falls into the latter category. I saw it for the first time on television, it did not need the wide screen or dramatic visual effects because it had been well-adapted from Stephen King's book to portray something that has worried everyone at some time in their lives. Being convicted of a crime that they did not commit and locked up for life with the very worst types of human beings. How being institutionalised is the only way to survive, but when it ends there is no way to go, no way to return to a former life. All human existence is based on a survival instinct. Once that is destroyed, death is a welcome relief.

The story hinges around three men, one who never lost it and escaped to live again, one who nearly lost it but re-gained hope from the first and one who lost it and killed himself. Although the setting was the harsh and hostile environment of prison, it could have been any other institution, a hospital, an old peoples home even a family home.

Andy Dufresne is different because he never lost the hope of escape, he used the weaknesses of others, the corruption of prison officials, the internal prison system to help his long term plan. He had the great advantage over the others, including the Prison staff of being , intellignet knowledgable and clever. Such people always win through. I did not know what the end was going to be, a clever piece of filming. Although the meassage was not lost,

It should give encouragement to all those who find themselves in a similar position. The justice system, although far from perfect is much improved so miscarriages can now be corrected. But I still wounder what it must feel like to be in the situation of Andy Dufresne but without his abilities.

Let's have more such films that provoke the senses and emotions as this one did. I make no excuse in adding to the hundreds of comments already make on this film , although I have not read them because I wanted mine to be original. But no doubt other thinking people would have made similar comments. I hope that writers, producers and sponsors read these comments and take note when making more such films",9
"Mostly what can been said has been said. This really isn't anywhere near he greatest movie ever made. For heaven's sake, it's a competent genre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of well-turned performances from the leads. Tim Robbins, incidentally, is way better in Mystic River.

Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more interesting and original prison movies than this one. Cool Hand Luke is obviously the greatest prison film of all time. Shawshank is so-so. Think about it, was there a moment, a second, a single plot turn in that film you didn't know was coming? When the young guy goes out for his little conference with the warden, did you not think 'come on, guy, haven't you seen any movies?' Predictability is satisfying I suppose, in its way, but give me originality and genuine passion every time. Shawshank has neither of those attributes. Sorry to everyone who cries every time they see it. You've been had.",10
Hands down the very best movie ever made. Not much else to say.,1
"I have been waiting a long time to watch this movie and I couldn't be more pleased. The Shawshank Redemption is something like I have never seen before. The story was brilliant from beginning to end and it is definitely something that I will never forget. The acting was wonderful, the story was genius, and the whole movie was just so beautifully done. I cannot find a single flaw and therefore, I gave it a 10/10. This movie is now, perhaps, one of my favorites and I think that it is absolutely essential to watch.",10
"I'm really happy to see that this film is still on the very top of the ranks all these years, and rightfully so, I'm glad that most of us agree to it. Amongst many films, Shawshank Redemption touches our souls in the most humane way. A film of art indeed, but it serves its purpose to the fullest extent. It is a movie that touches the souls of real lives. It makes us feel human.

The messages in this film are worth consideration, whilst the ending is one of most beautiful ones in cinema history. But enough has been said already, and I'd repeat most of them. As a conclusion, I'm proud to have watched this film. And it won't be the last. Rejoice for Shawshank Redemption.",10
"Few things you probably already know about 'The Shawshank Redemption': it was nominated for 7 Oscars, yet failed to win any, it failed at the box office and it is one of the best movie ever made.

I felt mesmerized watching this movie, and I believe everyone who has watched it must have felt the same. A perfect adaptation of Stephen King's novel 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', this movie stays faithful to the plot of the novella with very minor alterations. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have given stellar performances. Freeman's eloquent narration throughout the film provides the description of the events happening over the prison and his friendship with Andy Dufresne over a number of years from his character's perspective.

The main themes of the movie, hope, self-worth, integrity and friendship are beautifully interlocked with the prison-drama. The climate of Shawshank State Penitentiary is painted gray and dull to amplify the intensity of every event. The depiction of institutionalized life and emotions of the prisoners, who aren't only trapped inside Shawshank physically but psychologically as well, are very precise. The character of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, displays extraordinary courage and self-worth in the hopeless walls of Shawshank prison. The climax is intricately woven with poetic justice.

This film is Frank Darabont's Magnum Opus. A well deserved #1 on IMDb's Top 250.",10
"There are some things in this life we will never understand... How did the universe begin? What happens to our souls when we die? How did a movie as bland as The Shawshank Redemption become so overrated?

In the case of certain other movies, I can at least understand the reasons why they're overrated. But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.

The movie is partially redeemed by three things. The majestic cinematography, the powerful score, and most of all, Morgan Freeman, one of the very best actors working today.

As for my rating, yes I'm one of those jerks who gives a movie a 1 just to lower it on the top 250. I think it's outrageous how highly it's ranked here. Even the folks who made it would think it's ridiculous to consider it one of the greatest films ever made.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.

Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.

The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.

Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history.

Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time.",10
"This movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me, I didn't come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have always been a movie buff and, aside from that, a big fan of the writings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film, which I was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. Afterwards, I had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema.

First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale, in screenplay form, is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in, and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice (as our main character is judged by his peers) to the dawning realization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for it's masses of convicted felons. It all flows fabulously, as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. It's this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemption's impact.

Second, but just as vital, was the casting. Tim Robbins has always been, in my mind, a criminally underrated acting talent. He always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength, and in that conflict one always questions his motivation, his reason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the character of Andy Dufrense, who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. Indeed, it's safe to say that, mentally at least, Andy spent very little time in that prison.

Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that, I think, no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of Shawshank, he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to Freeman's on-stage abilities. As a ""man who can get things"", Red is instrumental in many inmates' lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples (cigarettes, petty cash), Red is as important a character as Andy in terms of the film's overall message of hope despite hopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job.

The excellent acting doesn't end there. Bob Gunton, who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types, portrays the warden of Shawshank as a sinister, scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the Bible and an arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude. William Sadler is another outstanding character actor, similar to Gunton, whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood. One of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden, Guard Officer Hadley, who was portrayed by Clancy Brown, well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense, hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesn't exist.

Beyond the writing and the acting, this movie was perfect in every other aspect. I've seen it many times over the years, often turning to it, perhaps subconsciously, during particularly rough or depressing patches. I've very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations, but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of it's impact or relativity nearly 20 years later.",10
"Run Tim Robbins's name in the database, and I don't think you'll find that he's starred in too many movies worth watching. Generally, most movies he's in have the subtlety of a ball peen hammer across your forehead. This movie atones for a thousand sins. Carefully written, deliberately paced, lovingly acted, this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side. Nothing is forced, but not a single plot thread is left dangling. Hollywood needs a lot more movies like this one. See it twice.",4
"Shawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong, firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it. The characters are memorable. Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head. Tim Robbins and Any Dufrense, is amazing as well. Shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie. Movies like this don't come often. Movies come with strong stories, but acting, and flow of this story can mess it up. Shawshank doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb, and the flow of the story is unforgettable. Based on the Stephen King novel, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, I'd say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel. The film also brings a sense of humor, which is a very good tool for films like these, because if everything is serious, it's very possible that it might be killed. Well, people have their own opinion. One scene amazes me, and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching Gilda, and they're all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the thing with her hair. It still makes me laugh and pleased, with the acting and reactions of the prisoner, and the beauty of Rita Hayworth herself. Shawshank Redemption is a one-of-a-kind film, where stories come in, and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level. The excellent acting, and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history.",10
"This is not just a movie, it's a message for your life that if you utilise properly, your life changes forever for good. But you have to watch it thoroughly, with clean, sharp and receptive mind.",10
Everything touched me. I will remember this movie for the life time. This is pure masterpiece,10
"I'm utterly mystified at the cult of idolatry that has developed around this solid but not overly memorable prison film based on a Stephen King short story.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" came out of nowhere in 1994 to be nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and I have to believe that it's the film's underdog story that has helped it to develop such a following over the years as much as it is the quality of the film itself. There's nothing egregiously wrong with it, but it's overly-sentimental and obvious film-making from a director who has done nothing but make too serious film adaptations of Stephen King novels.

I think it's become apparent over the years that Morgan Freeman is a one-trick pony when it comes to acting, but at the time he wasn't quite as well known, so the wise sage role he plays here seemed good enough to get him an Oscar nomination. However, it's Tim Robbins who really deserves the most praise as the man wrongly imprisoned. The less said about the actors who play the various prison personnel, the better -- they're all played as horrorshow goons.

The original Stephen King story was an entertaining bit of pulp, but Frank Darabont tries to turn it into something that the story just isn't -- namely, an epic story about one man's struggle to free his soul. As a result, where the story felt sleek and satisfying, the film feels sanctimonious and bloated.

Grade: B",5
"Are there people still left to watch this masterpiece? I'm talking to them, this ain't a /sci-fi/action/thriller/mystery/comedy/ movie. No CGI, No gut crunching actions. A drama yet so natural with exceptional acting moments. Just some prisoners talking to each other. Yet it is in the list of all time best. Yes, the makers might have prompted some magic spells same way like they did to the script.

It couldn't win the Oscars but pretty sure it will win your hearts . The Most influential movie for me.",2
One of the nicest films ever and immortal in memory,10
"This is a very good film, working on a number of levels. The main theme of the film is hope in adversity. I particularly like the way that Andy becomes a kind of Christ-type. It still does not quite make my own Top Ten!",8
"I haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no problems giving this one top score.

Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the elements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect ""form"". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).

The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, ""This is just right!"" Buy this one for your home collection because you'll definitely want to see it again.",8
"Let me review this film on two aspects: it's merit and it's high placement.

First of all, ask yourself this question: Is a film great simply because it achieves? I hope many think this is not the case. Shawshank has a slow and methodical pace. Along with good performances around the board. The simple staging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.

The writing is top-notch. The best thing about the film is the flow of the story, and I could have simply read a book. I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered, but being delivered well.

As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including murder, infidelity, and scandal.

Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time, actually. So I dare not say this is a bad film; I only say it's ranked higher than vastly superior films.

Rating: C+",10
I am not going to say anything about this movie. You just have to experience it for your self.,6
"Overall a great movie with good stuff about the movie, i really liked the movie and stuff about it and the themes and it's overall a good movie that i enjoyed.",10
"It's an ""emotional manipulation for dummies"" type of film, with boring direction and cardboard characters.

Nice performances by the actors though, some great moments, but nothing outside the ""Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison"" feel of the entire movie.

I saw it one and a half times, and would see it again only if I got paid for the trouble.

Similarly, I hated 'The Green Mile"", only later did I find out it's the work of Darabont.

My recommendation: Skip this, and go see OZ again.",10
"This movie is about the prisoners. The main character is caught in the false charge. At first, he claims his innocence, but he cannot prove it. In prison, he has his own world. Also, he is so clever. He plans something and it appears 20 years later. When the ordinary people are caught in the false charge, they may give up their life, but he never gives up. He carves out his life. I think he tells me the importance of living and having the hope. There are not so many flashy exciting scene, but there is some moving scene in an important position. They give more impression to audience. There are a lot of prison film, but I like this movie the best. I think the movie should be like this.",10
"Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10",10
Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A strong man can save himself. A great man can save another.,10
"The movie was a great success. The main character was very positive in all three aspects. In despair also do not give up, and through years of efforts to escape from prison to punish the wicked. The movie's main character allows himself to bring a little hope to the dark prison.",10
"This movie is more of a drama than action, but that doesn't matter, because it would fail in either case. A viewer can accept the cliché of the wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the grain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of murdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when the statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is dangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become believable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because such men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always comes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone finding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no idea what the ""redemption"" is. Nothing makes any sense.",10
"The best movie ever made, period. I won't go on a very long and detailed review on the story(which is magnificent and perfect)I just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was perfect! I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough recognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was underestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is an art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what I'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and perfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a shame that they decided that.

11 out of ten, totally deserves it.",10
I saw it a lot of times and I am ready to watch it again everytime. Great actors playing extremly fitting roles and a great story make this movie a go to movie for everyone.,10
"I figured prison life to be much harsher, as seen in other films. This is the films only weak point, but then the story would suffer if the film was like Fight club. This is a story about a man who loses everything but still survives. He uses his intelligence to outwit his attackers, and function in prison. No matter what happens he still kept his dreams alive. What is a man without dreams? The word institutionalized is used in this film to describe what the prison does to the individual. Tim Robbins will not have the inner freedom of who he is change to what the prison dictates. There are many interesting subplots that keeps the viewer's attention. These subplots culminate into a unforgettable conclusion.",7
"First time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was some two years after its release. Second time was yesterday and like every great movie it got even better this time. The movie is a beautiful story about hope that holds you above the surface even when your life seems meaningless. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are magnificent, and this film I can recommend to anyone.",10
"This is the gap, the gap in ideas, the gap in values. It is the gap between people, so there will be winners and losers in the world, there will be poor and rich, there will be this described by the story

It is not terrible to be trapped by high walls, for some people cannot be trapped. Birds of full plumage belong to the sky, not to be caged. But if ideas are trapped by walls, people get stuck in them",10
"i had to comment, i really did, all those eulogies on what is in reality a hackneyed complacent pretentious film. Nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought- its purpose is to confirm every conservative, sentimental, instinct in us all. And yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities, and bulldozes these throughout the film. Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through struggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and get their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters real, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no humour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship. Suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget Hollywood movies.",6
This movie is an amazing movie. It's not comparable . Friendship is an amazing thing.,10
"This is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. I think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didn't have such great competition that year, it might have won for Best Picture. This film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of it's own apart from the cast, score, cinematography, etc., all of which are deservedly great. This is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing, and stop and watch the rest of it, no matter what part of the movie you are at. Perhaps The Godfather and Jaws are a couple of others that do that for me, and it never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it. One thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director, Frank Darabont. Unfortunately, he has never come close to achieving the greatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films. I thought The Green Mile was good, but it didn't hold a candle to Shawshank. I was also very disappointed in The Mist. I sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film, because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so.",10
"This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around mystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed around emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of Morgan freeman then you should do this.",10
"I'm not a person that cry easily but this movie God damn, what a quality!!!.",10
"This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number 2 spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it. Trite , mawkish, shallow, unconvincing, ugly... How much more can I say about its awfulness? Morgan Freeman is tolerable, Tim Robbins is not. There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they aren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie. There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense: emotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological. Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them. Its appeal escapes me utterly. For the love of God, sink this film!",10
The best movie in history and the ending is the best ending,5
"The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. The Oscar's biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that Shawshank deserved. Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also an amazing movie, but it just can't compare to Shawshank. Morgan Freeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a performance that I feel is greatly underrated, and also deserved an Oscar nomination. The films art direction adds to the story's beauty, and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption on sale for $5 at Wal-Mart and thinking ""I heard this is good"" so I bought it. Little did I know the film was worth more than gold. I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks, not overly anticipating watching it, but finally decided to watch it when I was bored. I am a gigantic movie buff, and have so many movies it's almost pathetic, but The Shawshank Redemption changed my entire view of film. Now, every time I watch a movie I can't help but think ""It can't beat Shawshank."" Some people say that this movie is overrated, but that's wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art, to be compared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie makes them cry, they don't mean to say it's so sad, but that they didn't know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. I believe that if everybody see's only one movie during their life, it should be this one. See it now. After that, IMDb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is, by the very definition of the word magnificent.",10
"As I was saying just amazing, it makes you laugh, cry and even shout",10
"I finally decided to see this film after reading good reviews and noting that this film ranks in IMDB's top ten list (currently #2). At the very least I disovered where all the noble people are: they're in prison!

The film is decent, but it certainly isn't what I would call great or extraordinary. There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it.

This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair. If that's your thing, you'll love the movie. It's not really my thing.

5/10",10
"this film is very convincing hokum. nice, gentle, inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life - I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says f##k or fears bending over to pick up the soap. check out Freeman, in the token performance of his career, neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins' shaddow. what a team... so very progressive. 'hope...' . oh yeah, we've got a lot of 'hope' going on here. The lush fantasy kind, so deadly sweet and full of bull. frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet - that is no small achievement, considering... if you don't believe me check out his latest masterpiece, he just can't stop doing it. hell, why not! it sells tickets.",10
"Does it get much better than this? After 25 years of watching this, the answer is (so far), ""not really"".",10
"Let me start by praising 'The Shawshank Redemption' as is it's due. This is a gripping, manipulative, emotional prison drama with a tricksy plot based on a Stephen King story: as often with King, it's implausible, but director Frank Darabont handles its development so well that it seems believable as you watch it. Praise given, I now need to make clear that I do not consider this one of the best movies of all time, in spite of the ecstatic opinions of IMDb users (and others). First of all, the film paints a somewhat romantic picture of prison life. This may seem an odd thing to say (the life of the convicts is terrible), but the characters divide neatly into good guys and bad ones, the good ones share a sense of community but what's lacking is the idea that the victims of the prison world were the violators of the free one; all the murderers seem far too cuddly to convince. The only possible exception is the lead character, whose almost inhuman resolve makes it seem highly possible that (in spite of his protests to the contrary) he is justly imprisoned; when this ambiguity is resolved half-way through, the film loses something, and he becomes more myth than man. The real problem with the main twist (and the uplifting message it imparts) is not its improbability, but that it softens the world-view of the movie too much. The other main problem is that the film is too long: a braver director might have cut it dead at the crux, but Darabont insists of tying up every loose end, and wringing out every last drop of emotion in the process. It's still a very smart piece of entertainment; but its claims to greatness lie mainly in being exactly what its audience want to watch, rather than in supreme artistic merit.",10
"Word of mouth alone has turned this modest prison movie into something of a classic and there are many people who rate it as their favourite film. It's what's probably conventionally called 'a man's picture' but there are many women who love it, too. And there is no denying it's a good tale well told. There is nothing ostentatious about it. It's writer/director Frank Darabont was new to movies and he didn't do anything out of the ordinary. He structured the film like a forties or fifties film; old fashioned, traditional and likable, but not a great movie by any means.

And yet it has scenes that stay in the memory and which people recall fondly, (even if they are very brutal), and dialogue which sounds familiar. Unfortunately, early in the film there is a clip from ""Gilda"" that is more iconic than anything in Darabont's film. (Sometimes homage can be detrimental to a film).

Tim Robbins is fine as Andy, the young banker in Shawshank for the murder of his wife and her lover, (the film basically confirmed his star-status), but it is Morgan Freeman who walks away with the film with a quietly magnificent performance as Red, the old timer who befriends Andy and who is the film's narrator. Freeman gives the film a dignity and gravitas it really doesn't deserve.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time and continues to captivate audiences with its powerful storytelling, exceptional performances, and profound themes.

Based on Stephen King's novella, this film follows the extraordinary journey of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. As we witness Andy's transformation within the confines of the prison walls, we are taken on an emotional rollercoaster ride filled with hope, friendship, resilience, and redemption.

The performances in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are nothing short of remarkable. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced portrayal of Andy, showcasing his intelligence, quiet resilience, and unwavering determination. Morgan Freeman's narration as Red adds an extra layer of depth to the narrative, providing introspection and wisdom that resonates long after the credits roll.

The script, penned by Frank Darabont, is a work of art. Each line of dialogue is carefully crafted, delivering memorable quotes that have become ingrained in pop culture. The film expertly balances moments of heart-wrenching drama with touches of humor, ensuring an emotional connection with the audience from start to finish.

Director Frank Darabont's vision is flawlessly executed, creating a visually stunning and atmospheric depiction of life behind bars. The cinematography beautifully captures the starkness of the prison setting while also highlighting the small glimmers of hope and humanity that exist within it.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is more than just a prison drama; it delves deep into themes of friendship, justice, institutionalization, and the power of hope. It reminds us that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is always a sliver of light that can lead to redemption.

In conclusion, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a masterpiece that deserves its place among the greatest films ever made. Its timeless story, remarkable performances, and profound themes make it a must-watch for any cinephile. Prepare to be moved, inspired, and forever changed by this extraordinary piece of cinema.",10
"Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made.

But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb ""greatest movie"" debate. The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom.

Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the ""greatest film of all time"" because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.",10
"Shawshank Redemption!!!! First time when I heard this name I had no idea what Shawshank is all about. I must accept the fact that I was not fascinated by its name but luckily I managed to see this movie. This movie is awesome it will fill you with hope when you start loosing hope at some point of time in your life. That's the power of this movie. I have seen this movie maximum number of times as I have not seen others. Story goes this way:

A man who was wrongly convicted murder of his wife and her lover. He got two life sentences back to back. He felt that he might not be proved good husband but he was not a murderer so he started planning to dig the tunnel to be free from this. The way he dig the tunnel and the person who helped him in his project was the crux of this movie. So it was his hope that was kept deep inside his heart that provide such a power to escape from the Shawshank.

Please rent the DVD and watch it. you will surely find it most amazing movie as you have ever witness.",10
"I happened to watch this movie after taking a look at its ratings, I was like let's see what's all the hype about. After 142 minutes my jaw dropped and I said to myself ""This is the best goddamn movie I've ever seen in my life."". This movie gives meaning to life by being a legitimate feel-good movie. ""HOPE IS A GOOD THING, MAYBE THE BEST OF THINGS, AND NO GOOD THING EVER DIES."" the best dialogue ever written in any film ever produced. I was so into the film even I felt his redemption, I had a smile on my face by the end of the movie. Overall: The Best, The most satisfying, A pure feel-good film.",10
I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. It shows you how human nature actually is 10/10,10
"This classic films is one of my favourite movie of all time, and a perfect movie..well balanced by acting with a unexpected climax.",4
"Man..Oh man.!... What a wonderful movie... This is not a movie... This was art which was created when i was mere 2 years old.... I would like to share few words...

This movie is not everyone's Cup of tea... I am a big time FILMOHOLIC person... Watching film is not everytime entertaining yourself... Sometimes u just get lost in it...and feel like its happening with you... You connect with that story and characters... To watch this movie, you have to be very patient... I was so emotional at the climax and it was so satisfying..

When i asked few of my friends to watch this movie, some of them just ignored it completely and some started watching it but after 15-20 minutes, they left it.... I felt so pity for them... I don't know what was wrong with their minds. But they really did miss this GEM.

Nuff said... A big thumbs up to this movie and all the characters in it.",9
"This movie is filled with numerous lessons and values that you can bring into your life. Every momemt of this movie is so heart-touching and once you'll watch it, you'll see your perspective of life changing.

This movie is no less than a teacher, a guru, a guardian, a guide to life.

It teaches how you can land up in complex situations but instead of being emotional about it, you must work mentally.

It is never late to learn anything new. Never waste your time, just keep enhancing yourself. There's never a right place to grow. Just build your success, wherever you are.

Also, it preaches morals of friendship, consistency, realization etc.

Every scene of this movie opens up to a very different dimension of life.

I loved this movie. It feels as if it is all I needed in my life.",3
"The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie.",7
"This is without a doubt, the best film of the 90's. Morgan Freeman is brilliant as Red, his story is just as compelling as Andy Dufrense's. Only repeated viewings made me realise this. Another oscar tragedy that Forrest Gump won best picture over this, typical USA USA carry on. This story also proves Stephen King as a wonderfull writer and not just a one-dimensional horror novelist. So heartwarming, great humour particularly from the head prison guard and the best, most bitter sweet revenge in any film I can think of. A no questions asked 10/10.",10
"This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you...",7
"Writer and director Frank Darabont with this work from 1994 and also with ""The Green Road"" from 1999 shows his class in screen adaptation of novels and novels by Stephen King. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman show class as number one on IMDb's viewership ratings. However, one cannot fail to notice the reviews from the critics, but that's their job, they don't read King. Despite poor commercial success (in part due to competition from films such as Forrest Gump, Crime and Speed), The Shawshank Redemption received favorable reviews (yet) from critics and enjoyed notable approval on cable television, on video and DVDs. That's why I gave it 10/10 :)",4
"I shall be short with no spoilers about the movie.

This is a superb picture. Everything is right, spot on right. Beautiful acting, good camera work and a soundtrack that really helps the movie to that extra level. It is a slow, but not too slow, unraveling story with some nice twists and turns in it, all with a good ending.

Do not expect much comedy and quick action, but a good story.

My recommendation: 10 out of 10 points",10

"2417th review!!!!

Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever. The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because ""silence is full of unspoken words""",8
"This particular movie is the absolute best ever and should be rated #1 of all times.

With all the pages of comments that have been posted on this site; I will not even attempt to add to the eloquence of the previous comments.

I have noticed that many people have posted that they did not see this movie in the theaters. I would not even watch the movie on VHS as my wife and children begged me to take a look at the film.

The title did not appeal to me and I did not understand the title. I don't particularly like any prison movies. I just would not watch the film and I was probably watching ten movies per week at that time.

I finally watched when one night; I could find nothing appealing in the video store. From that moment in 1997; I've probably watched the movie about 20 times per year for the last eight years.

People refer to all the ""classics"" as being such masterpieces; but, I disagree. ""Citizen Kane"", ""Some Like It Hot"", ""African Queen"", Casablanca"", ""Godfather"" and all the others can not compete with anything about this movie.",1
This is by far my favourite film ....I can watch it anytime and it brings out the same emotions I felt when I watched it for the first time....a film par excellence with immaculate performances....must watch !!!,10
"O.K. you've seen the summary and you're screaming ""What kind of sour limey b@!*&%$£ says that about one of the greatest films ever made?"" Well I've got news for you, look again. The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie, i agree but is it all it's cracked up to be? - no. At first you think ""I feel great - what a feel-good movie!"" One can't help wondering that this film, on closer inspection, is actually unbelievably cheesy. Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. ""But what about the great twist?"" O.k., the twist was good but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects? Also, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit? Watch Le Samurai, or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior.",9
Absolutely adore this movie. it was incredible to watch,10
"It was a great and a pleasant surprise to see that the movie that I chose almost five years ago as my favorite movie of all time is the number one on the list. Although it's my favorite, my choice was based mostly on my personal reaction toward this movie and I did not expect that there are so many people that feel the same way I do about it. I love every single thing about this movie, every single shot. And believe me I know what I'm talking about because it's the only movie that I've seen so many times and it never failed to amaze me.A great story based on Steven King's novella, great direction by Frank Darabont, and great acting by Tim Robbin and Morgan Freeman. Not to mention music, and the truly original and always inventive dialogue. Every body who commented here on this movie probably mentioned all the obvious great things about it. I would like to add one thing that made this movie even more spectacular to me. The movie contains scenes that present a complete idea that stand and work on its own. Like the scene when Andy plays Mozart or the scene on the roof. Critics might choose others, but there's no other movie touched my soul like this one, and I've seen thousands of them. Remember ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"".",10
"When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good. What i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb !",10
"Don't miss it! Such an amazing acting, extraordinary screenplay and what not?

go ahead and watch it guys.",10
In my opinion the greatest film of all time. Acting - perfect. Pacing - perfect. Plot - perfect. Definitely a must watch for anyone.,10
"As a kid, this movie completely f'd with my head. I watched this at 8 years old, when it was released, and it really changed my life at the time. I experienced so many emotions that I didnt even know I was capable of experiencing at that age, and that is what a movie is supposed to do. Change your life! Challenge you. Provoke you! If youve never seen this movie, first, what planet are you from and second, watch it.",10
"Really, after all this time, why write about Shawshank now? Well, simply, it's still the best movie I've ever watched.... 10 times. This is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether it's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12). She too never moved from the couch and loved the film. This film will hold up to the test of time because it's simple: great writing, great acting, great directing and watchable over and over.",7
"this is the first time i am really wand to write something about this

"Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity, they can never take your Hope.",10
There are several amazing movies that are 9 but Shawshank is the only perfect 10 that I've given because it is so rewatchable.,10
"Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",9
Everything that a good movie can have is there is this movie.,10
"Why do you like this so much? It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie I've ever seen: The Great Escape, Escape from Alcatraz, Midnight Express, you name it. Because it allows the hero to be raped it's somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic. Far from it folks. The work of hacks, only the MAIN performances are redeemable. How 'bout that warden, quite a 3 dimensional character that one. As are all the peripherals. Its bad, but in an average hollywood way. Of course it's overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much. Nothing memorable, infact I'd have forgotten it totally if it weren't for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it. But hey if it does it for you more power to you. Just don't talk about it's ""power"" in front of me, I may puke.",10
"This film gave me the maximal inspirations and deeply touched my inner heart as I finally knew how to cope with everything when the whole world goes against you, and the way to get over everything when the god unleash the hell on you. For me, I am now facing the greatest challenge ornament my life as I have to conquer all sorts of difficulties to successfully get the good grades in my university",5
"I am not a big fan of Stephen King books. Therefore, it came as a complete surprise that this compelling story was written by the ""King of Horror"" himself. Never has any other movie entertained in so many different ways. It manages to be disturbing and uplifting, both funny and moving. Morgan Freeman is top notch as usual, and Tim Robbins gives his best performance as lead character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and buy it from your local video store. You won't regret it.",10
"When i first watched it i like it at once,it is really a good film.i can learn a lot of things from it.

¡°The Shawshank Redemption"", which is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.

The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.

But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society - who is strong, who is not - and the measured passage of time.

Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized - that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.

Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.

There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison - and us, too - is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.

The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.

The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.

Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.

All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy for everybody to watch, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing , maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this , everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!

"The difference between this story about prison in the middle of the 20th Century and any other movie is just about everything. From the great acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to the outstanding directing, this movie just makes the viewer feel as if they spent their time doing something worthwhile. The ending of the movie makes the movie, but without all of the other parts leading up to the finale, there would be nothing as well. Almost every scene in this has a point and a reason. Watching others view this movie for the first time, I've noticed that the interest is usual only at an average level during the first third of the film, but as the viewer is drawn in, they soon can't take their eyes off of it. Only the best of movies will have all of these qualities, and with it being a happy, successful story in the end, few can deny its greatness.",10
"I usually hate popular movies(pulp fiction, titanic, forest gump). So I was very sceptical when I sat down to watch the currently 4th ranked movie on the imdb. What can i say, I agree, this movie gets a 10, while some things are hard to believe(his escape) the range of this movie makes it easy to ignore. There is a lot of depth here. You get to see all the characters grow and age, you really get drawn in to the plot. It shows how brutal prison can be. And how dependent on the system one can become. Another minor thing I didn't like was how after ""The Sisters"" leader was beaten and transfered the prison seem to be a utopia except for the guards. There should have been at least a little inmate-to-inmate brutality shown.

A great addition to your DVD collection.",10
"If there's one surefire movie every person can agree on, it's the shawshank redemption. while it was originally a novel, it evolved into what the IMDb considers the best movie of all time, ranking #1 in the IMDb top 250.

Young man Andy Dufresne is framed and cast into Shawshank Prison, The 2nd worst prison in all of America (number one being Alcatraz) While being in the prison, he's sexually molested by insane inmates, Beat up by Heartless and immoral guards, and his experience as a banker taken advantage of by the warden. But through it all, Andy manages to keep hope through a fear that keeps all of his fellow inmates Prisoners.

All i can say is, Watch this film.

10/10",10
"I think if u see this movie first time, surely you will fall in love with this movie. Excellent work... 👌",9
"Saying this is the #2 movie of all-time is like saying McDonald's makes the best hamburgers. They're both palatable, predictable, inoffensive products that are easy to digest. Both have happy endings-- that is, if you find the stunning speed with which a McDonald's hamburger flushes out your digestive tract to be a ""happy"" occasion.

All you need to know is that Shawshank has the exact same ending as ""Trading Places."" So why not make ""Trading Places"" the greatest comedy of all-time?? What the hell, why not make it #3 on IMDb? It too is competent and utterly middle-of-the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre.

Instead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil, we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's the exact same ending! Shawshank was OK when I saw it when it came out. But count me among the backlash group that would rather see it with the 6-7 rating that it deserves. Thusly, I hereby cast my symbolic 1-star vote.",10
"This is such a good movie, that even to this day, many years after it came out, I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption.

Everything in this film is timed well. The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. The acting is great, and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. It also has a very clever plot. You are not 100% sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later.

Great job by everyone from director, actors to script. Just the best in movie making.",9
"That this film ranks as No2 in the 'all time' list on IMDB says a lot for how folks don't watch films from any era before the 90s anymore, for how else could it genuinely sit atop that list? I suppose in an age where everything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism is proving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than Chinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail and I? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for Night, Bande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some Like it Hot, Seven Samurai?

I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie stuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second pretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though Morgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film ever since), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a Stephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist at the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped on this utterly average experience?

And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank right up there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a buddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals across genders and other boundaries. I don't know. But believe me, if this were the 2nd best film ever made in the world ever, let's just say cinema wouldn't be the popular influence it is today.

Go out there, people. Find the true 'classics', find the films this piece of sentimentalia stole its every beat, every note, every word of dialogue from. And then come back and tell me this is anything other than a hotch potch, a 50s throwback with a 90s sentiment.",10
The Story is too complicated Waiting to another season too maybe *Hear broken* .,10
"I know that other people's votes shouldn't influence mine, either way--but geez, No.2 of all time? What are the IMDb demographics that create that overblown result?

I thought this was a very entertaining movie, somewhere around 8 points. But the script is kind of sugary and the characters lack the subtlety you would expect in a truly great drama. The ending reminded me of The Great Escape.

There are several good performances that aren't quite able to shake loose the limitations of the script and become stirring.

Cute, but not the greatest prison drama ever. I think there must be a lot of teenagers voting on IMDb.",10
"It is strange that this movie is 2nd in imdb chart, as it is the same old american story, where good people win, and bad guys died. More strange, the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false.",10
"Firstly, I cant belive that its been 25 years since its release. The script and direction are faultless, the cast are superb and its just a wonderful watch. I'm not going to spoil any of it but suffice to say if you havn't seen it by now, then please do, you will not be disappointed.",10
"What is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film making. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is going to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your day. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.",2
"Awesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on the night of his crime.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three- dimensional characterizations.",10
"Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A. I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters. The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher.",10
"This is a movie to be watched over and over. Each time I get a little bit more out of it. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together. Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King (one of my favorite authors) novel, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", especially since it is not of the horror/sci-fi genre. I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list.",10
"There are so many reviews here that it'd be amazing if anyone gets this far down the List, but it just proves how excellent this film is. Why didn't it win the Best Picture Oscar? Simple, because the Oscar voters, like most of us, hadn't seen it yet. Most people blame the title and the title does nothing to sell the film. It sounds like a religious film as did ""Deliverance"". It was definitely not promoted well at all. I would bet the farm that most people on this list of reviews DID NOT see it in a theater. I didn't, but since my first viewing of it on DVD, I've seen it at least 6 times. I loaned my DVD out to friends, relatives and neighbors and not one of them said it was less than excellent, and I'm talking some fussy movie watchers and folks who rarely watch movies. Why? Because it's an engrossingly fabulous story, told extremely well by gifted filmmakers and crew. It has everything a great movie has to have...stunning cinematography, crisp, swift-moving direction, an intelligent script, an emotionally moving score, a top-notch cast and more. If there's anyone who saw ""it"" coming, I'd say you're fibbing, as it is anything but predictable. What more can one say! Excellent!",10
"I have always loved movies in which to overcome odds, a character must think, and not just use muscle. The Shawshank Redemption is one of, if not, the best example of this!!! I LOVE IT!",9
"Seriously, if ever there's a film that people should be forced to watch, it's this. The acting in it is truly perfect, the storyline in very, very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest (and most misleading) endings I have ever witnessed. This film can (and will) be enjoyed by people of all ages (relatively - check parents guide for suitability), and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs.",10
"Based on one of the Stephen King's famous novels, this dramatic and superb film revolves around the fight for survival and freedom of Andy Dufresne, a bank manager performed by Tim Robbins who is wrongfully accused and prosecuted for his wife and her lover's murder. As a result, he is sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank, New England, a place ruled with an iron hand by a greedy warden and a ruthless chief of security.

Once there, Andy befriends another inmate, a kind-hearted man called Red, portrayed by the spectacular and always effective Morgan Freeman with whom he has a fantastic chemistry.

This movie is considered to be one of the masterpieces of the history of cinema due to its brilliant performances and wonderful message: Don't give up, no matter what.

All in all, I am of the opinion that in spite of its length -2 hours and a half-, this is an almost flawless piece of work which definitely deserves to be seen more than once. Just sit back, be moved by it and enjoy every single minute.",10
"Well as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your hope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care about your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop, do it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. Other films that moved me like this: Forrest Gump, The curious case of Benjamin Button. IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xD",10
"Touching, moving, exceptional in every single aspect of it. Grear movie and great actors.

"'94...the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was created...to bad you movie-goers disagree. Godfather Part I is a classic, but get real you can't defy this movie. It may get slow at points but it overcomes that with amazing cleverness and a few tricks up the director's sleeve. If you see or have seen this movie you will find or know that this movies brings out many surprises.",10
"This movie is good, there's no question about that, but he 2nd best ever? That's a bit of a stretch. I can't really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the 9 and 10 votes have seen very many other good movies. Sure, the story is meaningful and it's harsh etc, but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful. The fact that Shawshank is #2 on this list is a reflection of those voting.",9
"When you lose hope in everything, When your world narrowing on you and you think that is no point of keep going, when you feel unfairness, punished and you're innocent, then i advise you to watch this movie, it's a truly masterpiece !

This Movie is on the summit of cinema top movies of all time (well i didn't feel okay with that , sure it's an amazing movie, But on the top !! i'll be let that to another discuss).

a word - Movie - is very small for this immortal work, the film carries a lot of humans values and great life lessons, all that in a worse possible place which is prison .. Yeah Shawshank Prison !! Also that movie highlights and explain more things such as : patience, hope, friendship, Treason, Love, Injustice, everything was excellent on this movie started from cast to script until directing which was brilliant and almost perfect.

I want to recommend this movie BUT ... Who has not been seen This Masterpiece <3 !!",10
"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.

I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.

The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul",10
"Believe me when I say this is the best movie I have ever seen.and I have seen anime's,movies but there is nothing like Shawshank redemption.this movie is pure gold.best movie there is and there ever will be.it stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Amazing acting by these two.wonderful story and just amazing movie.words are not enough to tell I great this movie is.its just flows with you.",4
"This movie is the best drama movie I have ever seen in my whole life, it is honestly worth watching.",10
"It is a beautiful film witha a good intention. The celebration of friendship, celebration of life are the key points. Top notch acting and direction. It is a great piece of art.",10
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is that rare exception that transcends film itself to become a moving and harrowing experience. Based on a short story by Stephen King and brought to life for the big screen by Frank Darabont, one can only watch in awe as this story touches true greatness. Superb performances, commanding direction, smothering atmosphere, beautifully bleak cinematography. All the pieces come together, and do they ever. This is worth more than just a second look, this a modern masterpiece.

There's a great sense of inspiration that can be found at the center of 'The Shawshank Redemption', and that's a story of hope. Hope through all that life throws at you, hope in midst of uttermost despair. We go on a journey with these characters, and their stories remain with us long after we leave them. Andy's attempt to maintain hope and Red's struggle to allow the thought of it into his life is a powerful story to be told, highlighted by the fantastic performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

What else is it but art? If a film can reach out beyond the annals of cinema and become larger than itself, something more than a movie to be entertained by, can it be considered art? 'Shawshank' marked Frank Darabont's first venture into the work of Stephen King ('The Green Mile' and 'The Mist' would follow), and it arguably remains his best and most accomplished effort to date. His ability to set the tone and create its smothering prison atmosphere instantly grabs your attention and never relinquishes it.

'The Shawshank Redemption' is a deeply moving picture that has to be experienced, not observed. Felt, not merely seen. It tells an intricate story of extreme magnitude, leaving in its footsteps a poignant tale of hope and freedom. Allow yourself to be taken where films rarely go, the tragic beauty of it all is nearly overwhelming. A sweeping work of art to remind us that above all else, when all seems to be lost, never give up hope. As Andy tells Red, hope is a good thing. And no good thing ever dies.

"This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life, your life! Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere.",10
"I too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it; Robbins and Freeman were both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the nostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing. The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive, and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpable.

But it's simply NOT the best film of all time! Parts of it are cliched, most of it is downright implausible. The symbolism is trite and way too in-your-face, particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out (albeit touchingly) what should have been the movie's duty to portray.

The ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than it's ever felt before. Films have every right to be manipulative, but when it's this blatant the magic collapses. Or did for me anyway.

Mind you, still a smashing flick. I'm only nit-picking because everybody else seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship.",10
"This movie is probably my number one movie of all time. Everytime I watch it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time again. This movie shows friendship, determination, and hope (the main theme of this movie). I could go on and on about how amazing this movie is, but I encourage you to see it for yourself and the beauty of it. You won't regret, definitely buy it!",10
It gets better the original story of Sthepen King. Amazing adaptation.,10
"I would recommend this to anyone! Easy watch, although it might feel lengthy for some.",1
"What a movie! It was probably my 2nd or 3rd Hollywood movie when I started watching movies. Morgan Freeman was exceptional in his character as always though Andy Dufresne could have done better. A simple yet mesmerizing plot, wonderful cinematography and a memorable climax. This movie packs everything a cinemagoer desires. What I love most about the movie though is the message it delivers. ""HOPE"". Hope is the thing that drives us forward, Hope that we can carve a better future for ourselves than our past, than our present. Without hope, there couldn't be a meaning to existence.",9
"This movie is gold, i really liked and even more knowing is from the genious Stephen King... This movie has everything, we have mistery, suspense, drama, i really loved this film !!!",1
"One of the best films of its type, only bettered by Frank Darabont's other period prison drama based on a Stephen King story ""The Green Mile"". Mr Darabont and Mr King appear to have hit on the perfect partnership, in making fantastic films based in prisons and set in days gone by. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are both excellent in this movie, although Mr Freeman is always excellent (especially in his high school drama ""Lean on me""). Well done to all concerned in this excellent production, and let's hope that Mr Darabont and Mr King continue in this successful vein for the future",10
"What can I say about Shawshank that hasn't already been said? This is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I've seen it maybe a dozen times but I keep going back for more.

Tim Robbins is cast perfectly as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover and sentenced to prison, but who somehow never quite lets prison break his spirit.

In a sense, this can be compared to Cuckoo's Nest; Andy's effect on the prison and his fellow prisoners is much like MacMurphy's effect on the mental patients. And Warden Norton has a Nurse Ratched-like character, full of self-righteousness and a kind of indignation at having to ""teach them a lesson"".

Simple story or not, this movie is uplifting and inspiring. Wonderfully acted and directed, Shawshank's status as a classic is well-deserved.",10
"This title has to be one of the greatest films ever made. It is a touching story of a man who is sent to prison for life for the accused murdering of his wife and her lover. The story is so captivating and completely differs from other prison films because of its heart.

A defiant masterpiece which makes you enthralled within it from the very beginning. Brilliantly acted by Tim Robbins and, of course, Morgan Freeman as always. Brilliantly directed, scripted and the original score was very, very good.

I have watched it three times in the last year and I still can't get enough of it. A defiant worth wile watch.",10
"I tell you my voice sailed higher and farther than anybody in a grey place dares to dream to see my favorite movie still reigning at the number 1 spot on the top 250. Redemption, now let me see, I don't think I know what that means, to tell you the truth that's a politicians word. What do you really want to know, does redemption happen in this film, well yeah, I don't have it stuffed down my pants right now, sorry to say but I'll tell you. I suggest you just get busy livin or get busy dyin before you find out how salvation lies within. I have to remind myself that some films aren't meant to be caged and kept to yourself, that there's something inside that they can't touch, i'm talking about hope. Those who know Shawshank best talk about it often, but its that much more drab and empty now that its gone out of theaters. It's not easy peasy japanesey any more, its more like skin burning and half blind from that delousin stuff they throw on you. It looked at first like a stiff would blow it over, but that was my first impression of the film. There's nothing left but all the time in the world to think about why you haven't seen Shawshank yet. From now on I'll write two comments a day about this film instead of one.",10
"An inspirational and warm-hearted movie that almost put me to tears at the end. This is one of those rare movies that gets better and better the more times you watch it. The great lines in this movie just made it that much better. The friendship that was portrayed by the main characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were totally convincing. It's such an involving movie that grabbed me from the start, and the great music didn't hurt either. Don't miss this powerful prison drama that shows that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.""",9
"There are a very few movies that make you think ,think about the things that are important in life, things that truly matter and The Shawshank Redemption is surely one of those movies. It teaches you that life will put you in situations which you must not have imagined yourself to be in ever and how you can survive those situations. You will learn something new every time you watch it.",9
"Shawshank redemption is one of the greatest classic movie ever watched by most. If you are Hollywood fan, you must watch this. Because if you skipped this, you will be missed greatest movie experience.",10
"Wow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40 times... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch it.

For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how they make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies, angry when Tommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie makes me feel good. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the truth. Because of the way it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's why:

First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not matter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.

The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the relatively unobstructive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the walls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break through them as Andy does.

And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site is perfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world.",10
"Good cast. Good story. The performances were excellent and there was both ample food for thought, and some very good scenes. Didn't hurt that i'm a big Morgan Freeman fan. Always top notch.

On the other hand, overall, the whole film was far too unpleasant, preachy, and downright repugnant, to be terribly enjoyable. When the payoff at the end finally arrived, it just wasn't grand enough to overcome the feeling i'd just crawled through the sewer.

And for this to be the #1 film on IMDb (actually second, but same score as #1 and with more votes) among far superior films like ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Casablanca"", is ludicrous. This would never even have entered the remotest regions of my mind if somebody had asked me to name some really great films.",10
This is the best emotional roller coaster you could ever watch,10
"What I can say is this is a really great movie. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. You will succeed in the end. And also be ready at any time.

Maybe it is because of language problem, I don't grasp it very well in the beginning. But step by step, I understand it. And in the end, I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesn't happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past.

And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are good actors. And this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic, but still give people good feelings.

Great movie encourage you while entertaining you!",10
The movie had plot up the wazoo! The acting was superb. Robbins and Freeman were at their highest in this movie. There were so many emotions flying through it and there was so much about the human mind. It will leave you in awe.,1
"Sorry folks, but can this film really be (one of) the greatest of all time? Entertaining? Yes. Well acted? Err...yes. 'Life affirming'? No way. Realistic? Don't make me laugh.

Twenty years or so pass in this film. Does anybody get any older? Apart from the occasional pair of specs, that's it. Not an extra wrinkle to be seen. What happened to the make-up department?

People get beaten to within an inch of their lives. One death and one wheelchair case, but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear rapidly.

The 'baddies' get their just deserts and we're all supposed to shout 'serve them right' (as we say in England). The 'goodies' live happily ever after, but we knew that would happen within the first ten minutes. The people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a great author. Competent and popular...yes. Great...no!! P.S. Who replaced the poster after...? Was that an oak tree? Maybe leaves are a different shape in America.",10
"I just visited a prison museum in north China, which was a real prison used in early 1900s. This movie reminds me of horrible dark room, sodomy, and brutal corporal punishment that actually can happen to you in the jail.

Whether you are innocent or not, once you are IN the jail. You are all the same. Your are finished. But, Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is not. With hope and his persistence, he escaped from jail after 20 years. Imagine to dig a big cement hole with the small stone hatchet! Amazing.

Where there is a will, there is a way. This movie is encouraging.",10
"When I saw the movie for the second time, I would watch it more, and sometimes our love for the movie grew and increased through familiarity.

Shawshank is a classic Hollywood movie, all that can be said in this movie. It is a simple movie with a deep and eternal message. The reason for the great love of this movie and its highest rating on IDMB for 26 years is its great story and the amazing performance of its film characters in the movie, especially in the opening scene; The camera takes us and puts us in prison, as if we are not only watching from the outside! We meet prisoners and we become a part of their lives.

Instead of focusing solely on Andy the hero, the movie takes us to live with the rest of the prisoners the details of their lives. Director and screenwriter Frank Darabont proves that you don't need action scenes and special effects to make a great movie. Brilliant acting and deep intellectual narration It is enough to make it a masterpiece

The Shawshank Redemption is a poem containing mysticism that takes you thinking and inspiration to milestones, prospects, and life themes such as hope, love, freedom and life.

This movie is seen as the best over the past 26 years and is the best motion picture ever.",10
The Shawshank has one of the greatest messages of all time. Hope. Hope is the idea of believing in yourself or others. It helps you get motivated and helps you persevere. You see Andy dufrine getting wrongly accused and going to prison there he meets his mates and learns each and every one of them he studies the people the ward. at the end a miracle happens I'll try not spoil it. Overall I've seening this movie as a 13 year old really helps your mind. Too many teenagers are being depressed every single day. I want to tell them hey see this movie it will help you. Oh well no one likes my movie taste.,7
"In my opinion, this is the greatest movie of all time. Everything down to the smallest details make this movie mind-blowing. Frank Darabont did a fantastic job adapting the novella by Stephen King. Many movies use narration as a crutch due to bad storytelling but in this movie it's just amazing. Morgan Freeman did an extraordinary job as Red, and Tim Robbins was just as great as Andy Dusfrene. You can watch this movie again and again and again without getting bored. Like some 3 hour movies, this movie does not drag at all. Just do yourself a favor, and watch this movie. It's more than worth it.",7
It's really amazing movie but it doesnt deserve to be on the top of the list,10
This movie is the greatest movie ever made and has the greatest actors ever Iike Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and this movie has everything it has friendship hope sadness and a twist ending whoever says they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again.,10
"I cant believe that something so simply good exists. This is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my TV. I loved every piece of it and i'm gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. I can't describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it, because i can't find the right words to describe it. Watch it and you will see what i mean. The first time is always the best. It's the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. And after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece. What i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays. All those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it.",10
"This movie is ridiculously overrated on this list, and I think that I know why. This is the kind of movie that appeals to men who feel like they are wimpy and can't get over, but, in this movie, are able to get over. I'm sorry that we men have to worry so much about our manhood.

Anyway, Andy Dufresne is such a character. He takes all kinds of abuse, but still gets over in the end. The story is somewhat interesting, but King's characters tend to be superficial, and you only find out about them through anecdotes and action rather than through emotional expression (except perhaps Dolores Claiborne). Darabont doesn't do much to fill them out. Who is Red outside of the anecdotes? I only relate to him through Andy, who seems to be pretty one-dimensional as well. With the long, progressive story, there should be better character development, but no. I feel that these characters are kept at arms length, unless they are getting hammered or getting over. Not satisfying to me.

This morality play goes on too long and is not paced particularly well, though the ending is satisfying, and there are moments of true pathos. The acting is good but not exceptional. The narration holds things together, but becomes tiresome. The best thing about it is the cinematography, which is quite exceptional. Roger Deakins is a powerhouse.

There are loads of movies that cover similar ground (such as ""Emperor of the North"" or ""Cool Hand Luke"") and come out much better. I've happened to see it twice now, and overall, I'd give about a 6/10.",10
"After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i am doubtful if this will ever happen.",10
"I am so pleased to see the high rating this movie has received. Many people I know have never heard of it, but when I tell them about it and they rent it, they are 'converted'!! Compared to so many recent movies that are eye-candy, this film delivers the true meaning of friendship and focuses on this aspect instead of flasy cars, lasers, dumb plots and high paid actors bloated with self confidence.

Another movie along the same line is ""Spitfire Grill"". Rent it and you will probably enjoy it as much.",10
I really like this movie. It was very well done and the screen play was great. Totally awesome plot and the best acting I have ever saw. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It was a movie to die for. You could tell that they put time and efffort into making this masterpiece.,1
"""I have been thinking for a while to watch "" Shawshank Redemption""(1993) the number one movie on IMDb list 9.2/10,finally did it, its a excellent example of good story telling ,one of the story that makes u think and touches your soul, this movie is all about hope ,hope in bad times & not letting it go whatever is the situation ,hope that one day u will have your laugh,hope to be loved again,hope to achieve something big,hope to breath free. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)not only was hopeful for himself in the his bad time but made his prison mates hopeful by providing them feel of freedom through books and music,he also gave his best prison mate Red (Morgan Freeman) reason to live once he made it out from the prison. and as Tim Robbins says ""hope is one of the good things and good things never dies"".",5
"Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented on-screen. The director does an excellent job of showing the bleakness of prison life, the frustration of a life gone awry, and the misery of losing all one holds dear in life, while somehow preserving the hope of better things to come. Every actor was perfectly cast and the story-line draws to a perfect and satisfying close. If you enjoyed the film, you'll love the book from whence it came; ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"".",6
"The best movie ever made. Perfect acting, direction, script, music etc. It was seriously robbed at the Oscars in the worse Academy Award mistake of recent years.

There is no film better. That's all there is to say.",8
"After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating. The movie is nice, even good, but no way it should receive a 9.0.

The movie could easily have been produced by Disney: strong moral & a happy ending. Sure, there are strong points. The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins' performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind.

3 out of 5. That's all there is to it.",10
"This film is brilliant, just brilliant. I watched this film expecting just a normal movie but when it ended I knew it would stay with me forever. Every decade has one or two groundbreaking movies, the 70's had The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, the 80's had Platoon and Raging Bull the 90's had The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction and the 2000's had Gladiator and The Lord Of The Rings. There were a lot of good films in the 90's and this is up there with the best . The story is about a man called Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly convicted and sent to the Shawshank Prison. When there he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and then the story takes off. The acting is incredible and Freeman and Robbins deliver the performances of their career, the script is incredible (another great collaboration between Steven King and Frank Darabont) and it didn't win one single Oscar! This could have been good enough for three Oscars at the least, true, the competition (Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction) were good films but, The Shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple.

So if you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, buy it, rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever, be prepared to be blown away.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. Andy Defrain escapes from prison by digging a hole in the wall that is hidden under the poster of the model. Warden and Brookes commit suicide and Baron gets sent to jail. Lastly, morgan freemans character is set free.",10
"You'd certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence (kids are used to that nowadays) but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity, given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you, to say the least.

Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place, at the wrong time (early 1900's) and in the worst kind of scenario. He's convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the movie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the Shawshank Prison Facility.

Logicly, as a viewer, you side for the Andy Dufresne (beautifly interpreted by Tim Robbins). It doesn't really matter whether you think he did it or not ... he's stuck in there and it looks like he'll be there for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made, as you would expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships, however, is stunning. At the receiving end of one of those friendships is 'Red' Redding (Morgen Freeman), a fellow inmate. 'Red' can get you anything and as Andy, 'Red' is serving a life sentence. Let's just say they have the time to get to know each other, learn from each other and eventually save each other.

Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a few words, ""intelligence, justice, friendship, being human, redemption"" would all sound like understatements. Saying anything more about this masterpiece would spoil your viewing experience. It's just one you'll have to watch if you love movies.",9
Worth every minute of it! I didn't expect much from it but Freeman's narration got me hooked quick. The portrayal of friendship is on another level..then it finishes with a powerful punch!,10
"No matter what it is, hope cannot be closed. Everything is caused by hope. Is it because of the inner hope that countless hard work, hard work, and unrelenting returns? With hope, Shawshank Prison is nothing but a hope. With a hope, a small hammer can redeem life, redeem freedom, and even Shark Castle (Shawshank Prison).",10
The first time I watched this movie I was immersed in a prison world where survival is on the daily schedule and hope means everything. I was literally breathless for 2 hours. I just cannot believe how this movie was so undervalued when initially released. This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen. This is one movie where the ending does not really matter. It is the journey that will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will wish it never ends.,10
Just watch it....one of the finest movie ever made.,10
"This film ranks second among my all time favourites. The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Python's ""The Holy Grail"". Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film, with one of the best endings I have ever seen; even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman, who should have won an Oscar for his voice-overs alone. In a word, Exceptional.",10
"Don't get me wrong - I liked this movie just fine, I just don't understand how it deserves the *heaps* of rapturous praise it regularly receives from IMDb members, and the fact that is has been ranked at #2 in the hallowed IMDb Top 250 for the past 8 years or so just baffles me. It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as a good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I realize I am way in the minority on this, however.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film. It is one of the best films of 1994. It is one of the better films of the 90's. It most certainly is not one of the best films of all time, and in turn, obviously not the best of all time. I respect those of you who have put it at number one. At least it's better than calling Happy Gilmore number one, but I digress.

This is addressed to anyone who wonders how in all the world this film beat The Godfather, Citizen Kane, 2001, and even Pulp Fiction for best film of all time. Each of these films is celebrated, henceforth it is also ""chic"" to bad-mouth these movies. People hear that Citizen Kane is great so often that when someone sees it and is disappointed, they take it personally. Same with Pulp Fiction, so many loved it, that when somebody didn't like it all that much, their dislike becomes hate, relative to the passion some people have for the film.

Another prime example is Titanic. Where is it? It's not here on the Top 250. Yet upon its release (and the subsequent months it was out) you almost didn't hear a single negative word about it. Not until the people who were so sick of the raves went, minds already made up to hate it. Some people are so pretentious that they despise anything mainstream. Hence, the backlash against Titanic.

Now on to The Shawshank Redemption. The Shawshank Redemption is a film, like Titanic, that I have never heard one uncynical person say a bad thing about. Obviously then, its ratings will be high (well-deserved). However, also working in Shawshank's favor is the fact that it has never gone mainstream. The fact that it tanked at the box office may have been the best thing that happened to it. It never has become cool to knock Shawshank, therefore we rarely have people rating it 1 out of spite. With this lack of poor reviews, it is no wonder Shawshank shot to the top. It is a marvelous little movie, but certainly no Citizen Kane or 2001.",7
I really loved this movie I watch 2 time actually but it was too long,10
"I was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is 'The Shawshank Redemption'. I had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I thought I would see just how good the movie really was.

When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I sat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my girlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said ""That....is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life."" It was not just an ordinary and clichéd film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting, and a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just dragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film.

'The Shawshank Redemption' is unique in its own little way, and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that there is a movie like, but probably not as good as, 'The Shawshank Redemption' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century. Movies like this really change lives.

10/10",10
"Okay, let's say this from the word go...Shawshank Redmeption might as well be called Fantasy Island visits Alcatraz. Lets just see how many shopworn prison movie cliches the picture has:

1.) A corrupt warden 2.) Brutal guards 3.) Homosexual gang attacks (at least not in a shower) 4.) Innocent man sent to jail has a journey of self discovery 5.) All illiterate convicts speak flawless english and spout witty phrases. 6.) No racial tension, in fact no blacks with any character except Morgan Freeman doing a version of the kindly butler from a Shirley Temple picture...after all, it appears all he is there for is to be the witty sidekick and supply cigarettes and pictures of scantily clad women. 7.) A black man runs the illegal smuggling into the prison 8.) Nobody in jail is bad, or even seems like they could be violent, they are all a bunch of happy go lucky working class stiffs. I guess this means we should be able to identify with rapists and murderers as they are just like us...a chilling thought. 9.) Nobody except the hero ever attempts an escape or seems to want to escape, 10.) Over use of metaphors such as rain as a metaphor of washing himself clean of his past and putting on a new life.

I am not saying that all prison films have to be a version of Scared Straight, but come on, this is clearly a fantasy prison and the very unreality of it undercuts anything the movie might be trying to say. The Shawshank Redemption is in this reviewers eye nothing more than another holier than thou morality play packaged as ""gritty realism"" all because it is based in a prison...ho-hum.",10
We watch this when its on tv but i notice where they take out certain words so if you see it watch it on dvd! This is one of those movies that make you feel like you live with the characters and that's why the end is so redeeming to watch.,10
"I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course. The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language, powerful and powerless speech, posture, intimate and social distances, territory, chronemics, various types of listening, and self disclosure. Many ""young"" students struggle to relate ""in-class/in-text"" examples to their own lives, and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication. ALWAYS a good experience for my students!",9
Don't even bother reading any reviews this movie needs no introduction. Watch it and then regret it because no movie will EVER come close to how exquisite shawshank is. Please show this to the next generation when appropriate as its truly groundbreaking. (Or should I say wall...),10
"I have seen this movie a few times. Each time with the same hope and enthusiasm as before. The main story is obviously Andy's. His fears, his hopes and dreams... his struggle to remain sane. As a rock hammer, Andy chisels the prison around him. But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison. It's a tale of society, men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope, for friendship. All those around Andy benefit from his morals, his intelligence, his perseverance, his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men with no hope, no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part of it. But Andy changes lives. Some study, some begin to plan life outside the walls. Even the guards look up to a man as righteous as they come. Every time I see it I get the same warm feeling as the first time I saw it without actually knowing what it was, what it is... It's only fitting it sits on top of the charts and if that makes people watch it, it's just enough as it will bring them the same feeling again and again. I movie to watch once a year or whenever you need a little ""pick-me-up"".",10
"This movie is the perfect balance of class, beautiful directing and feel-good ending.",10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were splendid in this look at the horrors of prison life. Great camera work, acting, and a believable script led to a realistic feeling movie. This is only the second King book that made a good film; ""The Stand"" being the other.",10
"I am so happy to see this film top 1 in IMDb. It deserves to be there. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" appears in 1994, I think this year was full of amazing pictures. It lost Oscars but gained recognition. This is a great story about friendship and redemption. Frank Darabont's best movie for sure. Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art. A guy who is innocent and get punished. This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a legal world. No one is perfect, and no one can predict anything. We live by a scheme and trying to be fair. People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them. I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after the year 2000 nothing close to that appears. There were great films about life and stuff but still, it's a modification, a copy thereof what was before. I think until the year 2000 most of the valuable things in film art was told. It's a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create. I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like ""The Shawshank Redemption"". In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do. I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didn't say the last words.",6
"In short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a second –or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first viewing. The other night, overpowered by feelings of despondency and ennui, I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an impulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of the movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk it up to its beautifully crafted story, its virtuoso and powerhouse performances, and its underlying themes of hope, resolve, and ultimate salvation. This time, in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont has tapped into the wellspring of King the horrible's and fashioned a juggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the shawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks in that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our expectations and cheapened tastes, Shawshank does not intend to explore the horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants clutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from the shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration against all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie pulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters, events, shenanigans and skullduggery, the movie mainly delves into the friendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy Dufresne, played convincingly by Tim Robbins, who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent lives, and the veteran Red, the brilliant Morgan Freeman, carries the emotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of prisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank, the other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first night of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh fish Andy, who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a fish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses since Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any prison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize at first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months he says next to nothing, meanders through other prisoners in the prison yard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn humorous, poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient Red who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for the services he provides. However, Red's omniscience is not all-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of the introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion, he overhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an inheritance, he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on tax evasion. Now, he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the books for the prisons' powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His financial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the victim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his innocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too valuable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He never gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to him: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and remains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his source of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal to the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members. Morgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man. Tim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and inspiration. James Whitmore, as the institutionalized prison trusty who is suicidal in the outside, turns in a superlative performance. Hats off to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example of the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its popularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office, barely covering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it has snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot favorites and topdogs like Godfather, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, the last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards. Perhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is enjoying now. All in all, Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie with bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on next occasions.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. Arguably the best movie of all time. A thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow, this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True masterpiece. There won't be another movie that can be quite anything like this.

This movie is so powerful that I can't even describe this in a few words. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away, but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that ""Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies"".",10
Really this film is simply a string of cliches and is mediocre in every way.,10
"Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.

The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: ""You know that everybody in here's innocent?"" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.

This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.

The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and Léon.",4
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" did not win ""Best Picture"" because it will remain to be an example of how a movie does NOT need to win some sort of ""award"" top be considered one of the most prolific experiences an acting production can make someone go through.

This is not just a movie...It's an experience that everyone need to partake in. I have maybe only seen about 450-500 major motion pictures with about 80% of them being produced after 1980, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY MOVIE OUT OF ALL WHERE I ACTUALLY FORGET THESE ARE ACTORS ACTING IN FRONT OF A CAMERA WITH A MOVIE CREW. Do you know what that means? --It means not only Frank Darabont, but every single person involved in this film fused so well that they truly made a piece of artwork that puts people in such an emotional trance they forget whats happening for 2 hours. THIS IS WHAT EVERY DIRECTOR AND PERSON WHO WORKS IN THE FILM BUSINESS DREAMS ABOUT...MAKING A MOVIE THIS GROUNDBREAKING.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" will show you how true friendship can arise from anywhere...Even in a prison--where people fear the most to be in. --Maybe it shows the intrinsic drive humans have to create a social bond in any situation.

Sometimes when I talk about this movie to people I feel really disturbed when someone has not seen it. I feel like saying ""are you insane?""",10
"It's just perfect movie.

Subject, details, and engagement.

Describes the struggle of a human being a character who confronts injustice.",10
"As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.

But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..""I didn't understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...""The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.

I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as ""Dumb-Ass"". Andy says....""its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction"" Then Red says..""Why don't we put it on Educational category?""(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as ""Educational"" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.

This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..""Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life"".Thanx to all.",10
"Sure it was a good prison movie, and much better than many other movies I've seen. But this does NOT beat Godfather, Star Wars, or Casablanca in any way. Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot, but don't expect a present-day classic ala Forrest Gump.",5
"Trust me this one of the movie that u must be watched before dead. I really love the story. Thanks for stephen king!!! Good acting too. Everything about this movie so good. In fact from me this rating movie should be 9,8 :)",10
"Okay based on what is the greatest movie of all time. It didn't win best picture that year. None of the actors won an Oscar! Besides I have never seen a human who doesn't get old over so many years. I am sorry but I think bragging about this movie ruined its beauty.

Defiantly not a top 10 movie of all time.",10
"I won't repeat the ravings by others about this Movie (yes, that's a capitalized M!) I'll just share with you my experience watching it on CNN last month. I'm a graduate student, and midterm week was approaching. I constantly said to myself: Ok, I'll go to the library at the next commercial break ... but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the first 5 minutes... and by and by I forgot I was watching a film. Finally when it was over I was left tearful and speechless. It was that powerful an experience. I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching the film. Those 3 hours are worth every second of it, I can tell you that!",10
1994 - year for the classics. The best movie ever.,10
The shawshank redemption is the great show to illustrate hoe people according to their ancestry can be enslaved free or conversely in freedom captive shawshank redemption is a great show to depict.,10
"One of the most creative and satisfying cinematic endings. I don't know anyone who was not touched by this movie.

The story of two men, Andy Dufresne and Red, takes place inside the confined prison walls. Their growing friendship develops into a close bond.

With the desparation of prison life, the story takes a turn for the better at the end.",10
"The only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in IMDB but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1...

I only saw Shawshank Redemption once, and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since. It was ok to see it once even though I was almost bored then, but not quite. I found it very average in every respect, and quite predictable. I guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions, thoughts or memories, and does not have any obviously bad technical quality. Just sooo average. Hence the high score?",10
This is the kind of bad that I'll still watch after 30 years.,9
"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film of pretentious platitudes and obvious intentions. Based on Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", the film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongly accused of murdering his adulterous wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman delivers a much-deserved Academy-Award nominated performance as the hardened Red, the convict responsible for smuggling cigarettes into the penitentiary whose genuine depth allows him to form a friendship with Andy not based on the macho rules of the prison yard (Andy's demeanor is in face so falsely naive that many of the prisoners bet on him to be the first under pressure) but on a continuing sense of willpower and motivation in a place that genuinely lacks the atmosphere for such human emotions.

And yet whereas ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is in itself an honorable predilection of prison life and shows an understanding of the human spirit which is somehow lacking in the more recent prison movies (most notably Tom Selleck's ""An Innocent Man"" and Sylvester Stallone's ""Lock Up""), the film is deemed exceptional only by your willingness to surrender to Darabont's predictable machinations. Darabont may be a talented screenwriter, and some of his creations here (such as the character played by William Sadler, who comes across during an inventory inspection a copy of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexander...Dumbass) are unmistakeably human, his portrayal of the Bible-thumping warden (Bob Gunton) cannot resist but to relegate itself to stereotype. The film's real downfall is in Tim Robbins' performance, who despite his squeaky-clean cherub face cannot project the inspiration needed to give this film its realistic element. And yet this is not a bad movie, just certainly not the best movie of all time. Some images of the movie will continue to stay with me: the cold-hearted sexual depravity of ""the Sisters""; and in the infamous shot beautifully and rigidly painted by cinematographer Roger Deakins (""Fargo""), Dufresne basking in a downpour upon entering freedom. Unfortunately, the film isn't cohesive enough to warrant any more of those moments.",7
"Ok, so this isn't exactly a bad film, but it's extremely hard to see why it holds the no.2 position in the top 250 films. The acting is fine, the twist is gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are fantastic. However, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the part of Freeman's character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similes.

The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure - we, the viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a villain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references to book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins' character as Christ is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heaven).

In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five 'endings' - when we think that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is tagged onto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the cells. This, combined with the film's massive length, means that for my mind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10.",9
"This, for me, is film at it's best. The acting, (Tim Robbins, in particular, is amazing. Morgan Freeman is his usual wonderful self also.) the screenplay, the production, the...well, all of it! I could rave about it until I'm blue in the face, but I'll spare you (and myself) that.

I must have watched it over a dozen times now, and with every viewing I still get as caught up in it as I did the first time I saw it. For me, that's one of the marks of a special film. I'm don't really want to use the term 'uplifting' yet again, but it is the best way to describe it.

Highly recommended.",10
Bill's and Morgan's brilliant performances coupled with an immersive scenario and production makes this movie one of the all time legends.,10
The story line is beautiful and the casting expertly done. It one of those movies that you take so much from it that you get to criticize or judge other movies quality and casting based on movies like this one.,10
"Easily the best movie I have ever seen, and I have seen it a lot.

However there is not much that can be said about the film that has not already been said. Even though I have seen it more than 100 times and once saw it 4 times in one day the best thing I can leave you with is simply this:

Some extremely good movies are not only famous for there stories and acting but also their soundtracks. Inception would be a great example of this. Shawshank however is so extremely brilliant and captivating that you barely realise that the soundtrack itself is one of the best ever made. Seriously have a listen to the soundtrack on spotify and rewatch the movie. For me it elevated the movie to new heights, which should not have been possible.",10
"Movies which are better than their source novella!

Imagine that!

I admit I went and read the story after the first or second time I watched this movie, but I enjoyed it regardless. This film is a movie of hope and friendship and remaining alive even if the tunnel seems never-ending.

Well done all around.",10
"Very few movies that made me cry ... and (The Shawshank Redemption) is certainly one of them. I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship.

Very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance. It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved, but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all time based on people's votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation.

If you did not watch this movie yet, then you missed a lot!",1
"It took me 10 years to see this movie; I dated a guy who constantly talked about it 7 years ago; but I never did see it. I am not into prison movies; so I kept telling him I didn't want to see it. Whenever it came on television, I would go into another room and watch something else. I just thought he liked it because he has been in prison before; and it reminded him of being in there or something (silly me).

But, this Labor Day Weekend (2005); when it came on again; I decided to sit down and just look at it for the first time. Well; was I pleasantly surprised and glad that I did finally see it. Great plot, good direction, characters that had some depth and the surprise ending too boot. Also, just to be able to see Morgan Freeman act is a treat me for anyway; he is such a great actor. He finally won the Academy Award that he so richly deserved all of these years for Million Dollar Baby. He got robbed of the Academy Award for ""Driving Ms. Daisy"" and for ""Lean on Me""; but he finally got what was due him.

I also liked Tim Robbins portrayal of his character, as he was quiet, and smart. You know, being quiet sometimes can help a person get through many difficult ordeals in their life. Folks have a tendency to ignore you and don't pay much attention to you then. I learned how to be quiet and not so loud all the time; thinking is better than talking in certain situations.

Before I saw this move, I was not being treated well at work by my boss, and struggling with how to handle it. Seeing this movie actually helped me to do something positive about it. My boss and my job will never be the same.

Andy was right; we need to get along with the business of living or the business of dying; and living is much better.

P.S. I broke up with the guy I was dating 7 years ago; he was a jerk.

"You know it's really not the most entertaining movie ever made. you might look around the theater and see people yawning or even sleeping i guess it's not avatar where you get CGI things or these 3D animation movie they make these days nor any batman or superman thing to thrill you with the action. What makes this motion picture special is that you will grow to love this movie , the first time you walk out of threatre you may not think of it as the greatest movie ever made , but there's something about it which makes you see it again and again and each time you see it you learn something new from it. you may be impressed by these great budget movie they make these days but you surely wont watch it a hundred times literally. Count my words you will watch this movie that many times. It's a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions. Great great soundtrack by thomas newton is like a cherry on the cake.

The movie is so realistic and so much real at places it actually makes you angry, yet it's not a depressing movie like schindler's list or a fairy tale one like forrest gump , it's just a story which gives you hope and strength to face life and value it. believe me lol i have watched a lot of movies and this IS THE BEST ONE.",8
"This film is really an amazing movie timeless.

One of my all time favorites.

About the long-can write something in a movie.

Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie and I watched it for people to watch I would like to invite.

Than You.

Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",10
"There is no reason for this movie to be above Citizen Kane, Godfather 2, etc. It is a good enjoyable movie yes. But it is also cheesy at times and a little bit pretentious. I believe what works for this movie is that it has a sort of ""everyman"" charm to it. It is a movie that an entire family can sit and watch and enjoy. Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know movies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not very strong. The performances are solid, but I believe I have seen Morgan Freeman do this role better many times before. Is this a better prison movie than say... ""Murder in the First""? Probably, but is it sooo much better that this film deserves to be number 2 all time. THink about that... the second best film EVER. Somehow I doubt that.",6
"I've seen this film many times before , and every time I watch it it just seems to get better! There really is nothing bad I have to say about this film , because the overlying message of the film is infinite , and it's just such a timeless classic . I can't imagine the movie without Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them , because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. While there are some scenes that truly stand out to me , you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. It's one of the best of all time and I can promise you that you will enjoy it !",10
"Acted out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of Frank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of Shawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first time I ever saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I knew nothing about it, and was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten minutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the screen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about pausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying my eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman out-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim Robbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been regarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever emerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A story of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope. More even, than all of that, ""Shawshank"" is a story of humanity, and one that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long time.",10
"Based on the King short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', this Frank Darabont masterpiece has etched itself in the minds of viewers ever since its release as one of the most beloved films of all time. In the beginning of the short story, its alternative title is revealed to us: 'Hope Springs Eternal'. This in essence is the message that the film is trying to convey to the audience, and what a wonderful way it is revealed!",10
"Not for a reason. But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. Its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. A film who reminds more than presents. Values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. Short - a film who must see!",10
"When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free. And "" don't never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die "" this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :)",9
"this film is simply brilliant. the characters are all totally awesome and so are the actors who play them! also when watching this amazing film, you don't think to pick up on the little things until it all becomes clear! it truly is one of the best films that i have ever seen along side requiem for a dream and the lord of the rings trilogy. it is that good that when watching it, you forget that it is a film because you get so into the story and so in love with all of the characters. the men/women who wrote the script for this outstanding movie sensation is exceeding talented, as are all of the people involved in this production and they should all be proud of themselves for producing one of the top three greatest films of all time.",6
"Thank you Tim Robbins, you are the only reason I could sit through this long winded tale of garbage. As far as prison movies go, this suffers from an identity crisis is. Tries to do too much by not actually doing anything at all story wise. Watch Cool Hand Luke instead",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have seen in sometime. The first time I saw it was in my Film & Literature class and I loved it from start to finish. It keeps you thinking and even if you read the novella, there is changes to it. There are many foreshadowing in it that could help you figure out what's happening later in the story and overall. Many film fans should check it out and even later buy it if you want. The film also has many likable characters as well and you'll have some of those funny moments (but not a lot). It's a movie that you'll watch again and again.

Stars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Mark Rolston. Year: 1994",4
"Originally, I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption, but i've decided not to post it. Instead i'd just like to say that i would compare the movie to a poem that i wrote in 5th grade. i'm not going to write the poem out because i don't have it with me right now, but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following your dreams. In other words, it was complete b.s. I just wrote what i thought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together, hoping people would like it. My plan succeeded, the teacher thought it was the best in the class, and it got published in the school newspaper. Seems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont, and the writer of the book, Stephen King, did the same thing. The movie is technically well made and does succeed at telling the story. I admit that I got caught up in the ending. But no matter how much you try to defend it, it's still pure Hollywood. Cliche here and there. I recognize this for what it is: a director's attempt to manipulate people's emotions, which, due to a large amount of naivite in the world, succeeds. He did the same thing with The Green Mile with more success. Now, with The Majestic, I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and many moviegoers have recognized this, and given it generally lower reviews than his first two films. Finally! Now I only hope people will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down from the heights of the top 250 list.",8
"I know lots has been said about this film since it bombed at the box office then became a hit through video rental. I am probably not going to add anything new. I am a Stephen King fan, and have a policy not to watch the films made from the books as they usually turn out to be quite dodgy. However, I was urged by a friend to give it a go and I was not disappointed. This film is about hope and redemption and the characterisations are faithful to the original story.

Tim Robbins is perfect in the lead role, quietly enigmatic, just as I had pictured when reading the book.

The movie is quite old fashioned in concept but don't let this deter you. You are taken through the whole spectrum of human emotions and end up feeling better because of watching it. The relationship between the two lead men is charming and kind of restores your faith in human nature.

You must watch this movie whether or not you have seen it before, because it makes you feel good.

This film will end up being a perennial classic up there with the likes of ""it's a wonderful life"" and ""the wizard of oz"".

I can't think of a single criticism.",10
"After reading all the rave reviews for this movie, it turned out to be a real disappointment. Can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all ""crooks""?? Haven't we overdone the hypocritical ""Bible thumper""?? -- let's find a more enlightened characterization. James Bond, himself, could not have followed the main character's escape plan. The ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from ""Cool Hand Luke"". Enough!!! Unfortunately, fine performances by both Robbins and Freeman were wasted in this ""fantasy"" story.",10
"In these times, where an ""Every man for himself"" mentality prevails and one's self worth is measured by possessions, this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have, as this country spirals out of control, is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend.

As time passes and, more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social, political and economic disaster, this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. Perhaps, one day, we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and, a major theme of this movie, lies in our relationships with others. Until then, we will have the Shawshank Redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like.",8
"I've seen this film on IMDb so many times before on so many people's lists. But I just ignored it because I thought it was not what I was looking for. When I finally decided to see it, I immediately regretted not watching it any sooner.

The film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start, but in the end, you would truly feel redemption. You could feel the pain and injustice brought upon Andy, the protagonist. As I watched the movie, I felt as if I was in prison with him; I felt as if I've gone through the struggles that he went through as well. You could see how time is irrelevant in prison; you feel minutes go by when it's actually days, weeks, months, and years. And then you'll feel disappointed at all those years where you could have done something different in the world outside.

The film is also an eye-opener. You open your eyes to what its like in prison; although, the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real life prisons. You get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison. You get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never seem to want to leave anymore. There is also a depiction of how rampant corruption is, and its sad to think that those involved are the ones who are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law.

The cast is great. I couldn't ask more from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Even the other prisoners are good too. Overall, I think that the main point of this movie is never to lose hope; that hope is always a good thing. This movie is as equally good as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (movies that were made in the same year as this), but I can't understand why only these two movies got most of the attention. All in all, this movie certainly is the kind of movie to watch before you die.",10
"This movie captures many of things that made us love movies in the first place! It is a movie that contains many beautiful messages about life in general and how we should always be grateful for what we have, it's about friendship, it's about dedication and determination! It teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. I rated this movie 10/10 because I seriously couldn't find any flaw, the direction, script, acting, production values, and acting. What I like about this movie is that's all about humans, it's about the simple human needs that we seek, freedom, love, respect, power, friendship, health, fairness and justice. This movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference, it will touch you so deep!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written, directed, acted, and filmed. Yet in my judgment it is a below-average movie. It lacks a real plot, and, while the title promises redemption, nobody and nothing is redeemed. The characters lack depth, and many events are implausible.

No doubt, wardens and prison guards can be wicked people. But those portrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become uninteresting. Their function is to represent ""the establishment"" and ""authority."" The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne, the main character. While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted, he's hardly an admirable character, and he becomes worse during his imprisonment. He's a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the warden's criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing so--which he eventually does. The prison also has has a contingent of homosexual rapists, who are called ""not human"" so as to avoid admitting that their behavior is all too human, and very much in need of redemption.

Thus, the film's popularity: it appeals to our tendency to rationalize our own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters. Unfortunately, serving that function does not make a mediocre film great any more than serving sound moralism does.",9
"Ok, there are a ton of user reviews on here and everyone pretty much already established as to why this film is so incredible. That is undebatable at this point as far as I'm concerned. So, I'll just keep this short and to the point.

Yes, it IS as amazing as people say. Is it a tad bit over rated? Yes, perhaps. This is in no way, shape or form the greatest film ever created. If someone told me The Godfather was, I'd agree with them more on that. Both wouldn't even make my top 10 or top 20....there are just too many extraordinary films out there. My personal #1 will forever be Dances with Wolves...now THAT is a true human and well told story in my eyes that in no way gets the props it deserves on here.

But anyway....here's my main beef. If this movie IS indeed as well loved as it is today, then where are all of you supporting it? It has by far the most user ratings on here yet outside of this website the film is nowhere near a success.

Now, I get it why it didn't do well at the box office (it flopped). It was a difficult film to market. Everyone just somehow overlooked it - heck, I didn't even watch this film for the first time until just 3 years ago - but then why did it also fail on home video? It's nowhere near one of the best selling films. Usually you show your love for a film by supporting it and owning it. Both Avatar and Titanic are two of the biggest selling (non animated films) of all time. I bet some of these same people who bought these films prefer Shawshank even, but didn't go out and buy it. And something like this I find upsetting.

I don't think the close to 3M people on here even own the movie at all yet they claim it is the greatest they have ever seen.

I just don't understand why a film everyone praises so much isn't supported. Go right now and buy it on DVD or bluray. Heck, I did and it's not even in my top 20. Maybe top 30, somewhere...but it still deserves a 10/10 from me and I'm just such film viewer with such varied tastes.

(Ok, so this actually ended up becoming longer than I had intended.)",1
"I could probably write an entire novel about how great this film is... and it still wouldn't do it any justice. I like to consider myself a huge movie buff and this is probably what got the stone rolling. This movie single-handedly proves that you do not need incredible action scenes and hilarious humor to make a great piece of art. This movie is basically just people talking to each other with an occasional intense scene thrown in every so often and it makes it absolutely perfect. The one thing I love more than anything in a film is to see a group of characters change so significantly for the better and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the movie that does so better than any that has been made. Without spoiling anything, The two characters Andy and Red could not seem to be any more different at the beginning and throughout the film we gradually see them grow closer and closer together as different individuals and it grows into such a special bond that nothing could possibly break. Under such terrible circumstances the main character Andy has to endure throughout his time, all we see from him is nothing but hope, a message so strong that it is guaranteed to leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches and truly appreciates this beautiful piece of artwork.",9
This is the worlds best movie. Never seen any other beautifull movie than this one. Best acting and story. Must watch movie,7
"This has got to be one of the greatest films of all time! Absolutely flawless! The acting, the story line, the scenery is amazing. Amazing directing. Just a superb production. Sorry if I'm extra with the praises but this movie will not waste your time. I saw it several years ago and can still watch it til this day and be entertained. First review on IMDb.",9
"I really can't explain why this movie does absolutely nothing for me. It has a great cast that turns in some good performances, and the story is compelling; however, I always feel so empty after I see it. I get a similar vibe from FORREST GUMP and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, to name a couple others. I can't really figure out why.",10
"This film is hard, exciting, realistic, beautiful and surprising. The Shawshank Redemption completely absorbs you and constantly throws you back and forth between joy and sadness. It simply blew me away, and if it was possible, I would give it 11 without thinking twice.",10
"From the writing, direction, camera, and actors.... this is one of those films that seems almost like you have to watch it over and over. It reminds you never to give up, to figure a way out of your situation, to be patient.... the list truly goes on. Thank you for such an incredible film!",6
"This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my seventeen years. The movie is highly underrated by film critics, but if you look at imdb's top 250 films you will see it is rated #1. Tim Robbins gives his best performance, he plays a prisoner who is serving time for a crime he didn't commit. I guarantee you, you will enjoy this movie. Check out my other reviews!",10
"How many ways can I list why this is best movie of all time?

1. The most perfect ending of any movie I've ever seen. 2. Best story - Steven King (not even a fan of his) 3. Best acting performance: Morgan Freeman, absolutely

amazing, best ever (Tim Robbins is brilliant also) 4. Best narration - Morgan Freeman's character 5. Most uplifting, touching, moving story ever told. 6. Outstanding soundtrack 7. Beautiful cinematography. 8. Most evil antagonist - The warden 9. Best dialogue - so many memorable phrases and quotes!

I could keep going. I've never encountered a movie that has touched so many people.",10
Good very good its a good and i aconselho a ver fdsafsadfdsafdsaf,10
"A film which has every emotion packed in. Tim Robbins is fantastic. Morgan freeman is the typical Morgan Freeman, amazing actor who is in my eyes an all time great which we will not see the likes of again.

Mark Rolston(Alien, Rush Hour, Lethal weapon) and Bob Gumpton(Patch Adams, Broken Arrow, Ace Ventura) play the bad guys you hate to love.

The Shawshank redemption is a film that can be shown in cinemas till the end of time and will sell every showing.",5
"Ten Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story, incredible cast. I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films. There should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out ""Million Dollar Baby"" for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasn't all there when ""Shawshank"" deserved its due. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. Yes, this one is one to own, if you don't have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed.",9
"The title says it all. ""Hope is a good thing probably best of all & good thing never dies ."" it shows the actual truth what humanity always need most .",10
Fresh movie. Very good. I do be liking Morgan Freeman and Andy Dufreshne.,10
"Have watched the thing twice and frankly I still don't have a clue what the fuss is all about. There's hardly anything special about the movie, let alone breathtaking, intriguing or groundbreaking. The beginning is somewhat promising, but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to the moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is way too often overdrawn and phoney, the music - heavily pretentious and irritating. The performances are not bad, but let's face it - the script is far from demanding. The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytale-ish and even the drastic bits seem oddly out of the place, as if thrown in to make the thing feel more dramatic. Words keep flowing in abundance, soothingly creating the impression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace. Having recently watched the ingenious ""The Straight Story"" I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talk.

All that is not to say the movie is appaling. However, an inch above average is as good as it gets. Both ""Midnight Express"" and ""Escape From Alcatraz"" beat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down. 6/10.",7
I think that says what I think about the movie pretty clear.,10
"I cant understand why this movie got such a high rating. its a good movie but there are lots of others that deserve to be number 2 in the ""best of all time list"" (american beauty, pulp fiction, Chaplin's, Buñuel's or Kubrick's movies, just to name a few). Well..I'm an old Stephen King fan and the story of ""Redemtion"" is good and thrilling and the acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that has'nt been made before. don't get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a well made entertaining picture and nothing more.

So watch it and have a good time but don't expect an artistically great work or something all too original.",10
This was a very good movie. Robbins and Freeman are Terrific. It was a very moving movie. I would strongly recommend this movie.,6
One of the finest movies that I have ever seen. It's a must watch.,10
"These two did an amazing job together. You don't see this type of story telling between two actors in modern-day movies, let alone an amazing story at this level.",10
"I loved this movie! Beautifully filmed, the story is told as if time does not matter. No plot that has to be rushed through, no fast cars or anything. Just a very good story by Stephen King, marvellous actors and a lot of exciting emotions. It made me feel good to watch a man who keeps his hope for so many years.

The scene with the Mozart-record broke my heart!",8
"If you are looking for a story that is entertaining and just when you think you know the end you realize that this is not the case, this is the right movie, the dialogues are enveloping, the characters complex and immigrant and the relationship between them is intelligent and well managed.",10
"I cant find another word to describe this movie. AMAZING! The title is so horrible and i never expected i would watch it for 30 minutes. But when i saw it, i realised the big mistake in not watching it earlier.

The movie has a beautiful plot set over 20 years. Every part of the movie has a bearing on the ending. And never did i imagine such a spectacular ending. Not many movies can boast of a suspense of such a kind. This movie is not a thriller, nor is it adventure; but it is a desire of a Man who lives on Hope and who paves his own Destiny. Shawshank Redemption leaves you with a elated mind and a moral that it is fear that holds you back and Hope that carries you forward. I have only one message for IMDb viewers. Just watch Shawshank Redemption. Do not avoid it because the title is bad or else you too will have the same wretched feeling that i had today. Wish i had seen it when i did have an opportunity a decade ago. Well.. sometimes, cinema is like this. You go for titles, stars and big buck films and come back home disappointed. But Shawshank Redemption proves that all you need is a excellent script, a good director and some thespians like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.",9
"For the life of me, I can't understand all the gushing about this cornball, sentimental and PHONY movie. There are certainly some strong performances, but they're outweighed by some of the two-dimensional portrayals, weak writing (that opera sequence -- oh, please) and most of all a completely garbage ending (I won't give it away) that stomps on what little credibility the movie has.

I guess you really can't go broke under-estimating people's intelligence.",6
"This is a truly heart touching movie. One of the best movies I have seen. The story line is well written, the actors are all amazing in their roles. A mist watch. This is one of the best movies of all time. I never get tired of watching it.",8
"Sometimes it takes watching a two-hour film set in a prison to understand part of what life is about. At least ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has me convinced that's the case. This movie is one that does all the little things right and ultimately lets the story do all the talking--a story of hope and finding meaning, purpose and motivation in life or sometimes quite frankly, to live.

Writer and director Frank Darabont, who is the unquestioned king of adapting Stephen King prison stories and turning them into touching motion pictures, debuts here as a director who has an understanding of when to leave excessive artistic tinkering out of a film. Having created this outstanding screenplay, the script and the images flow seamlessly together throughout this film, so much that even the big moments feel naturally styled. He uses dark and light contrasts and some repetitive images to create a slightly fluctuating monotony to the prison life and those are the only ""tricks.""

The story is that of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), convicted to Shawshank Prison in the opening minutes of the film to life x2 for the murder of his wife and her lover. The film then shifts to the narrative of Red (Morgan Freeman) who has been a con at Shawshank since he was very young. While the film focuses on what happens to Andy in this vortex of inhumanity, what you don't realize is how the story is really about Red and what Andy makes him realize. Andy is a smart and clever guy and most of the first hour of the film is about how he brings some humanity to the prison and a mentality that is not common in a place with guys serving life terms.

Robbins was definitely ripped off on an Oscar nod. Its not that he blows you away with his dramatic skills, but it's that as you watch him you never once question his integrity as a character. Sometimes being that believable should be worthy of an Oscar, not just over- dramatic talents or actors playing unique roles. Freeman, however, gets his nod and that was also deserved. If I could have anyone narrate my life, it would be Freeman.

The second hour of the film turns it into a bit of a thriller as the warden (Bob Gunton) turns corrupt and begins to test Andy's limits. While many films do this, what makes ""Shawshank"" special is that you figure things out just as they are about to happen, which is satisfying. It's not too early that you think it stupid, but it doesn't come out of nowhere either. This hour of the film picks up the pace and brings it from just a depiction of prison life to something special and it's crucial to making the film as enjoyable as it is.

""Shawshank"" is not one of my favorite films, but it's the kind of film I could stop and watch every time it's on TV just because of its prevailing positive attitude. While it is so dark, it is so positive and motivating as it give the benefit of the doubt to those who do wrong. It's unforgiving, but then it becomes redeeming. The way it makes you conform to a prisoner's confined mindset and takes you out into the real world in just snippets that seem just eye- opening like the scenes in the grocery store can give you a whole other perspective on life. That and the script just writes itself out exactly as you know it should. Rarely does a film leave you as satisfied as this one does. While it might not be an artistic masterpiece of cinema, it is truly one of the greatest stories Hollywood has ever told.",10
"having this movie in your top ten best films of all time is like saying the greatest pieces of art ever painted are the ones they put on hotel walls. Maybe this is true in a sort of egalitarian, democratic and mind-numbingly banal way. A thoroughly ordinary film, that has been embraced by men who want to cry, have faith, and have equilibrium. Which is nice.",9
"Spending decades in prison for a crime you didn't commit can make an impact on your life. When you bond with a fellow inmate, life will be easier, and redemption follows through. In ""The Shawshank Redemption"", two fellow inmates bond throughout the years of hardships and good times. Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins), was arrested for killing his wife and lover, out of pure anger. He meets Red(Morgan Freeman) and they spend years together ironing out the rough spots. With all other dangerous inmates around like murders and rapists, prison life is a living hell! Sometimes the real villains in prison are the officials, including the warden(Bob Gunton), who was the worst of the bunch. Other inmates who raped or stabbed others got worse treatment than the other convicts. Being in the ""Hole""(Solitary Confinment) is not for the weak. One elderly convict Brooks Halten(James Whitmore), couldn't adapt to society very well when he got out. Got a new place and hangs himself. Andy, is very clever. He out cons the warden, gives Red a chance to live the good life, and he made himself a new man. There's a second chance for ex-convicts, if they can give it. 5 stars!",9
"After a sobering experience in the prison, what would a person believe as the best thing in life ? This movie tells so much story asides from the drama that going on in the prison.

Andy (Tim Robbins) is an accountant who's wife is cheating on him. She gets her comeuppance when she gets killed by a thug during her affair. Andy is accused of the crime, and gets sentenced for life at Shaw Shank prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who would become his life long friend. Andy knows he's innocent, and won't give up to get the freedom that he deserves. He devises a long term plan that will eventually bring bombastic results to the prison and its people.

Why would a movie about prisoners and life in prison ever make it to the top of so many people's best movie list ? Because it's about an underdog hero that gets his goods in the end. It's about someone who believes he's being mistreated, and through his genius not only devised a way out, but constructed a new life for himself. The irony, the humor, and imbecility of society is all crammed into this fine drama.

The finest drama ever to be captured on film. It would be a long time before someone makes a better movie than this.",10
"It's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since ""The Crying Game."" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.",10
"I suspect I can't add anything that hasn't been said, but I can add two things.

1. My personal experience seeing the movie for the first time 2. Examples of virtues the story beautifully portrays.

I won't spoil the ending, but IMO, any detail about this movie is a spoiler because it's just that good. So read at your own risk.

*Personal:*

This film came out in 94, which was an important year for me. I had just graduated high school with no direction and saw this movie ""accidentally."" I went to the movies with three friends. We were in line for the movie and couldn't decide on what we wanted to watch, even when we got to the window. One of my friends, frustrated at our indecision, chose ""Puppet Masters"" with Donald Sutherland and went his way. My other two friends chose Shawshank and I went with them as I could remember seeing a preview on TV and could tell that it was about something positive, though I had no idea what.

I had never been so engrossed in a movie my whole life. Do you know those moments in your life when something special is happening and your mind is 100% in the moment? That's what it was like for me. Like the moment that you are rounding the bases after a home run. You're not thinking about anything else. I was hooked and took the ride.

*Virtues:*

What's good about the movie? Well hope is certainly the biggest message of the movie, but there's more. Think of all the greatest human virtues. They're all in the movie.

Friendship: Andy and Red had the best bromance you could possibly ask for.

Tenacity: ""Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of s--- and came out clean on the other side.""

Purpose: ""Prison time is slow time, so you do what you can to keep going. Some fellas collect stamps, others build matchstick houses. Andy built a library. Now he needed a new project. Tommy was it.""

Direction/Decisiveness: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""

Salvation: Andy is saved in every way possible. And by doing so, saves others around him also, most of all Red.

Wits: When physically resisting a gang rape doesn't work, Andy goes for psychology: ""Sudden serious brain damage causes the victim to bite down hard.""

Influence/Wits: Andy provides financial advice for the captain of the guards while simultaneously getting free beer for his prison mates, thereby creating harmony on both sides.

Sincerity: Andy is not a fake, about anything.

Forgiveness: Though never stated, it's obvious that Red and Andy struggle with forgiving themselves for what they've done.

I'm sure there are other examples.

If you haven't seen the movie, watch it in the dark with no distractions. Watch without pausing if possible. Turn off your phone. Take it all in.",10
"One of those films you must see in your lifetime. The soundtrack alone is five stars! Sublime acting all around. A film that may have been a slow burn in popularity but has now established itself as a true hollywood masterpiece!! 🏅

P.s. my all time fav line: ""the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.""",10
"Compelling, fantastically acted, and superbly well written- The Shawshank Redemption can certainly be a slow ride- but one far worth the wait. Tim Robbins gives a tremendous and extremely underrated performance as Andy Dufresne, truly capturing the emotion, atmosphere, and pain that is all involved in a life of prison. Morgan Freeman also gives a rather good performance as well, and Robbins and him together make for quite a unique pair- not to mention their terrific chemistry. The film is very cleverly shot, and it housed to some of the greatest cinematic story elements (at least by the end) in film history. The biggest problem with The Shawshank Redemption is its criminally slow pace, which is by all means, reasonable, considering how long the characters have been in the prison, but you can't help but feel there is something missing as you stare bored at the screen in those moments- wondering if the writers, directors, or producers could have done just a little extra something to spice it up. In the end however, The Shawshank Redemption is a really good adaptation of King's work, and is clever in so many ways. It's performances are fantastic, especially from Robbins and Freeman, and may feel a bit dragged out, but contains some truly captivating moments. My Rating: 9.25/10",10
"Perfectly fine yarn, but those who are ranking it among the all-time greatest movies need to see some more flicks. The cliches are pretty heavy at times, and the moral of the story seems to be freedom _isn't_ a mental state, after all.",10

"""The Shawshank Redemption"" has so much skill which went into the production that it is regrettable that it's overlength undermines its attributes. Episodic, slack and slow formatting stretch the narrative far beyond what its material requires. The result is a fair film, with some worthy touches.",10
"One of the best films I've ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why, However if you're a big Sly or Arnold fan, you may not like it as it doesn't have any exploding cars, plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables",10
"This movie... is overrated. It's a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it is NOT the greatest movie ever made. Still, definitely worth a watch.",10
"This is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and no doubt the best of Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont created a masterpiece.

It is a very intelligent story telling us how hard prison life can be. It critics the judgements of innocent prisoners. But the most I liked is that every time there is another interesting story that develops in this prison. At the last third of the movie we can enjoy the big surprise or the dessert. This novel is very nice told and it merits standing ovation. I and my wife rarely see such films. This is quality of film making and today where we are? 8.5/10.

If you liked this don´t miss another masterpiece from the same director called ""THE GREEN MILE"".",10

James Whit more Also Gave a Great Performance

The Way Frank Directed The Movie Is AMAZING. He Kept This Movie At a Great Steady Pace Along With The Writing And Great Cinematography.

Each And Every Cast And Crew Did An Excellent Job..

Do Yourself A Favor Go Watch The Movie.",6
"this movie is all about that great story King wrote, that with great cinematic expression, great acting, great sub plots, this is a movie you can see many and many times in your life and every single time you see it, it will deliver emotional good feelings...

Andy Dufresne's expression on his face through out the whole movie is incredible, the very old guy with the bird, he's just perfect, i feel like he's my grandpa or something, you just can't help to not love him, his character is the one that really got me emotional... Morgan Freeman is great like in all his films, you just can't think of a better casting... i love this film

i'm not quite sure if it deserves to be #1 on the top 250 IMDb list, but well, you decide... hope you love it as much as i do !",9
"To be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life, Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the way it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. I've read a few (not that one) and what comes through in the movie doesn't seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may come along but it may be a while.",7
"you can't get more, from a motion picture Morgan Freeman undoubtedly is a great actor and finding him as supporting actor in movies has been a culture in the modern cinema.

The movie have a great plot the director did a great job, concentration on the story have a solid field and the scope to keep you sticking to your chair the movie have such a dialogue delivery that you have to pause if you even blink your eye.

Shawshank Redemption as the title is tempting so is the movie the star cast is great the performance can't get better, and criticizing the all the rules and regulations of the society challenging the so many other other things the movie becomes a legend to the todays actors enough war movies enough jail breaks you have seen in movies but it's all inspiring all contributing to the society and the diamond to the industry and the milestone for the coming actors is this. Tim Robbins performance is great as he lived the role and the eye stretcher movie shawshank redemption.",10
"Finally I Watched ""Shawshank Redemption."" Well, Last night I watched a movie which has most un-believable rating on world's most trusted movie rating site, IMDb with a rating of 9.3 by more than 800,000 votes (yes!). I's indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you know, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level) Now, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life imprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn't commit. Here it remembers me about the classical Russian novella named 'The Kreutzer Sonata' by ""Leo Tolstoy"". It seems to me a bit inspired from that. Indeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a story of a man's struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the prison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself innocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole story tells about the moral to heed i.e. ""Hopes Never Die."" I really can keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves so, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn't check the duration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just sitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off course). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off course terrible sleep in my eyes, I'm no more in situation to write anything else. But one thing I'd make sure that very soon I'm gonna read 'Stephen King'. And, At the last I'd like to halt my review by one of the dialogues of the movie, Which I liked a lot, ""Get busy living or get busy dying."" And, I'm really nowhere an obtuse to just review it like a blind-head Ass. Lol :) Remember Hope is a good thing.",10
"wow, how in the world is this film #2 of all time? Am i living in reality? hello? hello? can you hear me? am i actually a human being living in this world? hello? am i dreaming? there is no way in a infinite years that this film can be anywhere remotely close to being #2 of all time. maby the 99999999999999999999999999999999999999th film of all time, but not #2 of all time. no.

this film is for people who likes to be easily manipulated

this film is a joke

this film is so stupid that for the first time an object acknowledges its own retardation

-revision 12/29/2009- Sorry about the above comment from years ago, that was not very mature. This movie is okay. However, it should not be rated so high, as there are more deserving films. I have to admit, this movie had no emotional impact on me whatsoever when I saw it. I find it interesting it was able to touch so many people. I still think there was a conspiracy to boost the rating of this movie.",10
"It is a well-known fact that The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most well-made and moving films in the past twenty years as well as in cinema history. It doesn't have the formula that fits most huge successes. It consists of almost two and a half hours of dialogue between many prisoners that carry on for nearly twenty years. To the majority of movie-goers, that is a recipe for boredom. However, for those who appreciate the medium of film as less than entertainment and more as enlightenment, this is the perfect example.

In order to be so effective, this type of movie really only needs two very successful angles: the acting and the writing. Both are covered quite well. Morgan Freeman is terrific as Red as are all the supporting characters. However, it is Tim Robbins as Andy that sticks with me after the movie is done. Somehow, and Frank Darabont deserves credit as well for writing this character so thoroughly, Robbins is able to embody a kind, considerate yet gentle spirit into a man that is allegedly convicted of murdering two people. This alone is evidence to show he couldn't have done it. With this blessing, he is able to influence nearly everybody he comes into contact with, especially Red. Together, they form a bond most people only dream of. And this is what lies at the heart of The Shawshank Redemption. According to Andy, there is a feeling, and idea that drives a man to try and overcome all obstacles he faces and to not rest until he has done so. That would be hope, and with this Andy Dufresne is determined to come out on top.

Simply put, this is a true piece of art as well as being on the best films of the 1990s and one of the best films ever made.",10
"Well now I've finally seen it, and I have to say after the tremendous build up from everyone I've spoken to (IMDB No.2!) etc.. I thought it was ..... OK. I think I would have scored it higher if I'd seen it five years ago but now without nostalgic hindsight it's only a 7!! Shock.. This film is still well worth seeing but the characters are not as well crafted as in 'The Green Mile' nor do they command your compassion (Brooks excepted).

I suppose I'd better see 'Hannibal' SOON!",1
"Sent to prison for a crime he did not commit... no wait, am I about to review the A-Team... without spoiling, if you haven't seen this film the by the end of it there are some A-Team style antics deployed :D

Sent to prison for a crime he did not commit, a former banker struggles with life on the inside. It's not until he makes friends with a wise long-term prisoner that things start looking a little less gloomy. They bond through shared interests, morals and knowledge and eventually try to make things a little better for anybody they encounter. The banker though is keeping a secret from everybody which makes an exciting finale to the film.

A lovely film which is character driven and very emotive. Stuck in the same location this film had to be a character driven film, and its two leads; Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, pull off a magnificent performance, complimenting a tight and clever script with some gritty and raw acting. The film is an adaption from a Stephen King novel, which is sometimes a curse (some movie adaptions having been poor), this however is absolutely great and has become a cult classic film. If I had to pick out one single word to describe this film it would be 'hope'. This film is about hope, not just for the characters, but the audience too, in fact at the time of its release too, hope for the film industry that was changing away from character driven dramas to more action based films.

If you haven't seen it, watching this film may be one of the best things you do with yourself. Easily a 9/10.",9
"If you want to see hope in its most poetic and dramatic sense, choose The Shawshank Redemption. I commend it to everyone who thinks movies are more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life and its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such compelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what redemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if we let it reign inside of us.

From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of each character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office title. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best Picture by far.",9
"The evangelical adoration this film has earned is lost on me. Like so many popular films of recent years, ""Shawshank"" is an obvious, cliche-riddled epic that's won fans because it plays it safe. Characters are either saintly or satanic. There's no room for shades of gray. Sure its sumptuously filmed. A $50 million budget can do that. Add the always solid Morgan Freeman, a paper-thin moral about hope, and you've got a film longing to be loved. Obviously, plenty of people do.

But compared to Freeman, Tim Robbins' vanilla performance as the long-suffering innocent (dare I say Christ-like) man trapped in purgatory comes off bland. Clancy Brown as the sadistic prison guard is the worst cliche of the all. When you toss in the obligatory prison rapes, the corrupt warden, and James Whitmore (who is very good) as the veteran inmate unprepared for life outside the institution, you've got a predictable film that only snaps to life near its plot-holed conclusion.

Worse of all, Frank Darabont directs the works at half-speed. This is a painfully overlong concoction.

In time, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" will be regarded as a well-crafted but shallow prison film.",7
"I have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. On the left is 'The Dark Knight' and on the right is 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. These are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and, in my opinion, are the greatest films of my generation. I have watched each countless times because they're filled with action, suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome.

Then, purely because it was rated highly, I watch a film not of my generation, on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special effects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance.

Each are excellent. Shawshank's better.",9
"This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation. The drama was compelling, the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection. The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration. This is a great example of what film making is all about. It doesn't rely heavily on ""movie magic,"" but instead uses camera movement, framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences.",10
"I'm sorry but I just don't get the big deal over this movie.

It is pure melodramatic schmaltz. Give me Cool Hand Luke or Papillon any day. Or how about Scum or even Chopper.

I have to admit I felt the same way about The Green Mile, maybe it's just Stephen King's view of prison I don't like. As if he has a clue!

I think he should just stick with the coming of age stuff (loved Stand By Me) and the isolated looneys (The Shining), things he can obviously relate to. Leave prison stories to the folks who actually leave their house.",10
"when i started watching shawshank redemption ,i think it's a kind of slow movie type about a an investment banker who's role played by Tim Robbins one of most acclaimed actor of her genre , accused in the murder of her wife , by identifying the affairs with other guy , and come jail of shawshank and her in jail the actor face so many difficulty by jail's offcials , fellow criminals , and also get few a nice friends including Morgan freeman . Tim Robbins who just get deep into character and play role with excellence , as the story movie the role of actors are get more intense , and as Tim Robbins who initially afraid but on the other part he get more calm and relaxed and determine and managed to survive and working on her secret plan , when you watch this scene you get blanked , you never thought of such thing happy in the movie , it surprise suspense just leave with a question mark on her mind in every seconds , at last Tim Robbins successful in task and reveal the liking of Marley Munro in the movie .

i like story of shawshank redemption and its characeters ......",5
"This was one of the best films of the 1990's and was all but snubbed by the Academy. It was nominated for seven Oscars in 1995 including best picture, but it came up empty, trodden under by the Gump stampede.

Frank Darabont's adaptation of Stephen King's short story was a thing of beauty. The story of an accountant who thinks his way out of a maximum-security prison, and survives on sheer intelligence, guile and will is expertly spun and engrossing. The ending is uplifting and exhilarating.

Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave career performances. Robbins was outstanding in the portrayal of a character whose phlegmatic and understated persona belied his cunning and razor sharp intellect. Freeman was also fantastic as the old convict who knew how to get things done in the joint. Freeman's performance got him a Best Actor nomination in a year when Tom Hanks was a cinch.

Everything about this film was superlative. The direction, the cinematography, the sound and the music were all top flight. It is difficult to comprehend how such an accomplished film was left with so little acclaim.

I rated this film a 10/10. I highly recommend it, although viewers should be advised that there is some disturbing prison violence. Don't miss it.",8
"This has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. I first saw it when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying it and i've watched it a few times since then.

The characters have so much depth, you end up loving them the more you watch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.

This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little on Stephen King's novella.

This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDb",6
"This movie has been rated number one by IMDb for a reason. Why? What's not to like? It has everything. Crime, drama, romance, some comedy. The writers were very well set on what they wanted. They achieved it. One can watch this movie over and over. Every time I watch, I notice something new that I had not noticed before. This movie is very well written. This movie is very well produced. This movie is very well acted. This movie was very well financed. They did not need to use too much money to produce it however, one would never know. Yes. It's that good. This is definitely a movie that belongs on your shelf or in your movie collection. It's rated number one for a reason. Anyone who rates this below an eight, doesn't really know what a good movie is about. The way it's written, directed, acted, financed, produced and acted. If I had three thumbs, the would all be up. So, three thumbs up. If you've never seen this fantasias film, you're missing out. It's a must have. Enjoy.",10
"Without a doubt, one of the greatest films ever made, little to no continuity errors, fantastic acting and a thrilling and engaging story that keeps you hooked from start to end.",10
"When I first saw this movie i was 16 and wasn't allowed in the theatre since it was rated R. I asked some of the people standing in line if they would let me come in with them. I don't know why I wanted to see it so much(the trailer wasn't that great). But when I sat down and watched that opening sequence where the judge slams down that gavel for the poor Mr Dufresne and Red comes walkin in to the parol board i knew i was in for something special. The cinematography of that old prison was amazing. As we hear more dialog coming from the two main characters our hearts go out to these ""brave souls"". The character development is better than in any movie i've seen for a while. You really start to care and feel for these imaginary people as if you knew them. The more times i watch it on my laserdisc player, the more I can't believe how anyone could not at least ""like"" this masterpiece of filmmaking. It really got the shaft at the oscars. Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated. I still don't think forrest gump had as much to offer about the human experience as ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION"". It really is a fantastic piece of work. Writing, acting, direction, and cinematography come together in this masterpiece.",10
Still not as good as Mario Bros 2 best game of the year 70 years in a row,1
"Words cannot encompass how great this film was. The acting, plot, and even the soundtrack was absolutely spot on. I'm not exaggerating it, but this film really felt like it transcended past me just enjoying the film to actually feeling the film in my soul. To feel that pit in your stomach, the ache in your heart, to the warmth that spreads throughout your body, I was just left in awe of the marvel before my eyes. Even after the end credits roll, I was lost for words. My curiosity as to why this film is first in IMDb's Top 250 movies list is finally quenched and I leave with a smile on my face and happiness in my heart. Don't think I'll need to say this but I'll definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone. Just know that the better the films you see, the worse the bad ones get.",10
"I can understand why this film is loved so much, but I can equally understand, although I do not agree, why it is despised. People say it is life affirming, brings hope and happiness, and it does, others say it is sentimental crap, and at times it is. But I've always been a sucker for sentimental movies, ones which have the power to genuinely move the viewer, and not hide under a cheap plot and a tragic death. Being another King adaptation, there is violence, and hardness to counteract the sentimentality, and the prison, although not as horrifying as those seen in Midnight Express and other movies, breaks the human soul to the point that it relies on the prison for survival. Heartbreaking, tear jerking, brutally funny, all phrases used repeatedly to describe this film, all appropriate. A film everyone should love. Great Quotes: Andy. 'I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged' 9 out of 10",9
"The Shawshark Redemption is very good movie. This is a story that reflect prisons as seen by many prisoner. The Shawshark Redemption also reflect society problems. The plots and actors played very well that make me wanted to continue watch. They are very professional as a director and actor. they capture and identify with America male spirit as it shows in movie. The story is even more interesting seeing red and Andy building a relationship in a prison. Scenes are very good. Overall, this is a fantastic film.Comparing this kind of movie with other type of movie like comedy,I recommended every movie lover to watch this or you will be missing one of the best film.",5
"In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film in the whole way of action and how we learning from this movie. Shawshank encompasses friendship , hardship , hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going though. These artists show their capability to produce art, real art that in spires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.So, Shawshank is the must see movie in your life before you gone.",10
"If you haven`t seen this film, watch it as soon as you can. Maybe you`ve had the chance to do it, but just skipped it because you thought it was one more story in prison. Yes and no! YES because most part of ""Shawshank Redemption"" happens in a prison, but NO, it's not like the others. It's much better.

The story, you may know more of it in the Plot Outline, is really interesting and the performances are just impossible to forget. There is a little of everything: drama, friendship, violence, love and dream...""Dream of Freedom"". That's the title in Portuguese.

My Rate 9/10",10
"A simple brilliant movie in all aspects. I am not sure how many times I have watched it and each time it still has the same effect. When you feel low, watch this ""hope is indeed a good thing"".",7

"My friend asked me that question and I said... TODAY

I saw The Shawshank Redemption today, yes nearly after 14 years it was released and after 26 years of my life on earth... I should have seen it much before, I guess. I am truly moved by the story and more than that by the character roles played by Morgan (Red) and Tim (Andy). I have to admit, this is not one of the greatest, BUT THE GREATEST movie ever produced.

Brooks was there, so was Red... I wish I was also there to see it for real.

This movie gave me new avenues, new thoughts, new energy and more than everything... it gave me what it gave Morgan Freeman... HOPE",10
The movie depicts how a man can achieve the most incredible feats once sheer will is applied.,10
A movie based on a Stephen King book could be great or awful. Thankfully this was amazing.,10
"I don't want to offend anyone, some of you actually seem quite intelligent, but listen up: If a movie is on the on top 250 list, in this case second from top, it simply states that this film is the second best liked film in the ""IMDB"" world. You can't argue that it don't deserve it just because it aren't as creative, innovative, artistic or influential as many other films are. ""THE SECOND BEST LIKED""! It's a fact. Swallow the truth.

Movie lovers, as opposed to the general movie enjoyer, have, like most disciples of art a much more developed, or trained mind when it comes down to their field of obsession and will choose accordingly. (You can't expect your classmates to love jazz, prog rock and classical music, just because you do.) Shawshank Redemtion is, obviously, generaly an enormously likeable movie and even some of the most artsy people people I know accept it as valid and enjoyable entertainment. In my book it rates a solid 9/10. It's indeed, along with Back to the future (that ranks high much because it hit me so hard in my early youth.), my favourite mainstream movie of all time!

"This is without a doubt my favorite movie. Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic. Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it.

Robbins, Freeman and Whitmore's characters are the ones that I like the most.

It is just stupid, unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes. The IMBD voters have it at #2. My hope is to see it in the future at #1.",10
"Gut-wrenching! Beautiful! Intelligent! A masterpiece! The actors are perfect in their roles, I am surprised Tim Robbins didn't rise higher in his stardom than what he actually did after making this movie. The chemistry between him and Morgan Freeman is perfect! Every single character makes sense and seems ""real"". The dialogues are realistic as well. It portrays the corruption going on within heavily guarded facilities (such as this one) in such a simple, yet brutal way - that despite the crime committed (with a few exceptions of course) it makes you question the justice system and its fairness. I can relate to people I would never have thought I would in real life. I won't say much more about this movie, except tell you to watch it! Even if its not your type of movie, even if you tend to get bored with dramatic tales - anyone can learn something from experiencing watching it! Just be prepared to feel real human emotions. If you don't then something is seriously wrong with you!",9
"This film should be joint along with The Godfather as being the greatest film of all time. The character development and the messages that is conveying is beautifully done. When the messages such as hope, friendship and survival come together, it makes an excellent display.

It consisted of different metaphors when they were drinking the liquor on top the roof, and Morgan Freeman was narrating his thoughts as feeling that they were a free man, this was the best moment of the film and made me how at that time people were living in jails.

Excellent. Prefect. Outstanding film, best jail film I saw in my entire life...10/10 PS watch out for the new drama that came out in the UK... Prison Break on channel five. If you liked Shawshank then you will like this.",10
What can I say? Probably the best movie of all time. Really well written story with a beginning a middle and an end.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. This is a film that focuses on what happens to people when imprisoned. The different experiences had amongst each character are all representative of what kind of person the character is. This movie has gorgeous cinematography and classic dialogue, this paired with the peaceful yet ominous score make an amazing atmosphere. On top of all these technical marvels you also have one of the best stories ever told. The Shawshank Redemption is truly a work of art.",10
Well made movie with a great story. very long and dragged at times (2 viewings),10
"Always a favorite of the members of this site, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has proved itself to be much more than your average film about prisoners. It took me a bit of time to reflect on this movie before I truly realized how great it was. In this film, Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man sent to prison after being falsely accused of murder. He meets Red (Morgan Freeman in one of his best roles), and the two of them leave prison many years later as changed men. I can't explain what sets this film apart from so many films like it, but it simply fascinates me. Watching Andy bring redemption to himself and the other prisoners and his clever methods of escaping from prison are wonderfully done, especially when you don't realize until later what he is doing. Perhaps my favorite scene of the film is when Morgan Freeman gives his final speech on why he should be let out of jail, as this truly displays how much he has changed throughout the film. His choice of words is brilliant, and the scene can't help but make the viewer think. The film could be cut down a bit, as some of the scenes are fairly unnecessary and repetitive. However, even if you don't think the film is anything special the first time you see it, give it some time. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" gets better and better the more you reflect on it in your mind, and the second viewing will prove it.

***1/2 out of ****",10
Real good movie....but has taken a lot from Papillon (1973),10
"As we all know, valling something a 10/10 is a high statement to say in this world. I believe that this is one of them, and I don't think anyone should think it isn't. If anyone thinks this movie is bad, they either haven't seen it or they just misunderstood it. Let's start off with the themes. The themes about friendship and hope in this movie were potrayed perfectly, especially friendship. There was even a moment where friendship really was one of, if not the main theme of this movie. Next, let's talk about outside parts. The cinematography was one of the things that were just perfect. The acting and music were also some things that were just perfect. One last thing, the backstories to characters. This definitely fits in for being in the debate of the ""greatest movie of all time"". Once I have kids in the future, once they are ild enough, I can't going to have to make them watch this movie. This perfectly portrays that if you get too used to something, you wouldn't want it to leave for your whole life.",7
"You won't regret seeing this movie. Even if you love movies such as Fast and Furious, you will like this one. It's impossible not to like it.",10
"Like a lot of people, didn't really seem an interesting title when it was released. WHOA. This is a movie that I know I've watched the most number of times than any other movie. Fantastic movie.",10
"I have always heard what a great movie it was but never got myself to watch it since I didn't want to watch a prison movie. However, I am so glad I watched it! I was sort-of suicidal when I watched it; and it gave me hope and made my heart warm even when I was at my lowest!",10
"Another one of those overlong morally right-on movies that never rises above average - saved only by the acting.

Its bleeding-heart politics 'dignity of individual maintained in adverse conditions' is played-out well enough but actually lacks any real dramatic tension.

Dufrane is a two-dimensional character who seems to go through the drama by numbers - there's never any doubt that he will triumph in the end, it's only a matter of how.

Tim Robbins has done many more interesting films than this one - try The Player or Bob Roberts if you're looking for drama/moral ambivalence and how they interact.

Basically, there are a lot better prison films than this one - Jailhouse Rock for starters.

Like most Stephen King stories - quite prosaic. There was a story in here somewhere but it got over-inflated and somewhat lost along the way.

One to watch on a rainy day when there's nothing better to do.",10
"You may think 10/10 is a given, but the way I see it 10/10 is perfection. This movie is NOT perfect. It relies too much on the ending. The first 2 hours of the movie ( great as it is ) is lacking complexity. The remaining 20 minutes fools you into thinking it's the best movie ever made. But I am here to tell you It's NOT! I love this movie with all my heart but I just don't think it deserves the number one spot.",10
This is exactly the type of movie the new era cinema need ... Magic!,1
"I can't put into words how great this movie is, this is probably the greatest movie of all time.",10
One of the rare occasions where the movie is as good if not better than the book.,4
"This movie provides positive proof that the IMDb website has security holes. Somehow the family members of the filmmakers hacked the system to grossly inflate the votes for this movie. How else to explain the No. 2 ranking of a film that probably does not belong in the Top 2000? It is an entertaining prison yarn but there are at least twenty prison movies that are superior to this and the filmmakers had the good sense to borrow from these (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, etc.). In fact, the same director's The Green Mile, which is also based on a Stephen King story and set in a prison, is a better film. On the acting front, Robbins and Freeman are always watchable.",10
"This is one of my favourite films ever. Why? Well a lot of reasons really. But mostly because of the plot. It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art. The actors are superb (note: Freeman - why he didn't receive an Oscar for this one, I'll never understand). The story is great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King (Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all among my absolute top films. Try them out. I promise you all several great movie-moments.",10
"Shawshank redemption is one of the best and outstanding movie of all time. i watched it in 2017 and i was just watching it simply and in the end it just left me speechless.Totally obsessed with this movie.movie has a such brilliant sort of logic in the end.this is the movie with no any action,fighting or any violent thing but a pure drama and suspense which is why it is called masterpiece and piece of art.

this is kinda fantastic and brilliant movie of all time that can never re-make in the history of hollywood.the acting of tom robbins and morgan free is so genuine and stunning.we can not totally think that andy is with plans and in the end what a shocking scene is.

Movie has great background music.and the most importantly thing is that ocean in the end what a scene it is.the talks of andy for the experience of life is so emotional and when he says that i want to live at a place where memories doesn't exist.what a thoughts and genuine acting of robin william's is.totally obsessed with this movie.",10
"No matter how much i talk about this movie i wouldn't give it justice. The movie got nominated for a lot of awards won nothing but the people loved it its been the no. 1 movie of all times by over 2 million people votes the story the direction the actors it's a piece of work, it makes you angry, happy, emotional and inspiration. You should watch if you haven't already",10
What a great movie. It's been my fave for years but I never knew just how many other people liked it until I saw that it was ranked #1 on the top 250 list here at IMDB. It may not be the greatest movie ever made but everyone who has seen it liked it. I can't imagine anyone hating this movie. The best part of the whole movie is when Red walks down the beach in Mexico and meets his friend on the boat. You know everything's going to be okay after that.,2
"Oh my God, I no doubt about it, love this movie more than any other I've ever seen!!!!! I mean, the script is just breathtakingly brilliant, and the acting was superb, PERFECT even. I can watch this movie any time of the day, because it never gets old and I never like it less. I am so glad to know that it is highly appreciated on here as well, and it needs to be, this movie KICKS ASS!!!!! If you're a hater, you don't know what a good movie is, and get a life, but if you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY, ""HIGHLY"" recommend you see it right away for you have missed out on something special your entire laugh, and truthfully, that makes me sad. SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION IS TRULY THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent example of Hollywood craftsmanship. It has believable acting, excellent pacing, good cinematography and tells the story in a very effective manner. But it is film as a craft, not as an art.

To put this film in the same category as those of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Truffaut or Bergman is like comparing a piece of quality furniture to a Picasso.

I doubt even one in a hundred people, who hold this film in such high regard as to vote it #2, could actually name the director if you asked them in the street.",1
"This film is overrated, it can't possibly be the best film ever, there are much better films than that, however it is still a good film.",9
"The story's quite plain, the acting is OK but nothing really over the top, even though the soundtrack, the quality of the shots and the atmosphere really stood out! I think it's for obvious sentimental reasons that people like this movie! The good guy takes a lot of crap but wins in the end because he's smart!! There are way better movies than this one and I really can't understand why so many people rate it 10!! 10 equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it!! I think 7 is a very high rating and this movie probably doesn't deserve more than an 8 maximum!! The masses don't necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained, that's what the movie industry is about! Still, this movie was quite gay! Way too much emo and way to predictable!",10
This is certainly not a bad film but it is Also completely overated in my opinion. This story has been done a million times and How the wardens didn't notice he was chipping through the wall everyday to escape is beyond me. The acting throughout is very good but i am shocked to see this number 1 on the chart.,10
"What can i say?...The only film to make a grown man cry! No film comes close to this in any way or form,it draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene!.Enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.",3
"One of the best movies ever made! This movie is a masterpiece not to be forgotten. There is no other movie like this, and you won't regret it if you watch it. I'm.",10
"The 'Shawshank Redemption' undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.

Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.

Didn't watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Can't miss a movie like this....",10
My lifetime favourite movie in Hollywood. Can't believe such a wonderful screenplay and characterization in jail. This movie will be speaker for generations. Hatssof To the screenwriting and director. Morgan always rocks. Salute to director and screenwriting,10
"Three words: ""Cool Hand Luke."" Same film, done better, done earlier. For that matter, is this film any better than other Steven King ""novelettes"" such as ""Stand By Me""? All in all, it probably ranks a 6 or a 7, but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film, I give it a 1 in one man's attempt at sanity.",10
It is a great piece of film making and a story of hope. Justice is done at the end. I also recommend you watch Female Prisoner Scorpion.,10
"Shawshank may not be the best film of all time, but for me it was perfect. A film is perfect (for me) if it shows a character who wins against insurmountable odds (Robbins). Another essential ingredient for a perfect film is a character who, by his actions, changes the life of another human being for the better (again, Robbins). The last 15 minutes of the film are so gripping: we don't know what is going to happen to Freeman, but we are so involved at this point that any other ending would be unthinkable. I loved this film!",10
"I came expecting a masterpiece and left with the impression I'd seen a relatively unremarkable film with pretensions of profundity. Put plainly, the primary message is ""Hope sustains the human spirit in a world of hardship and despair,"" which is a truism that would fit nicely in a fortune cookie. Nonetheless, the power of hope can serve as an affecting theme. Perhaps this common theme is taken by so many as great depth because so much of Hollywood's product these days is appallingly shallow or callously brutal. Apparently, the public is desperate for something to care about.

The direction is somewhat mannered and reminiscent of older films, which in itself is neither good nor bad. But in this case it blends with a storyline that seems virtually comprised of movie cliches of prison life. The characters are also stereotypes: the evil warden (bible-toting, naturally!), the brutal and inhuman prison guard, the gang of prison buddies, the gang of cell block victimizers, the experienced convict who has mastered the system (played by Morgan Freeman), the enigmatic newcomer who works subtly to subvert the system (played by Tim Robbins) -- all the classics on parade, with few of the unnecessary peculiarities that define real human beings! We've seen them all before, and in more realistic guise. These one-dimensional characters function with the monomania of gears in a machine, churning out a largely predictable plot. This is typical of allegorical stories, and I suspect this story can be read as allegory (which is not surprising, since it is based on a Stephen King tale). Regardless, I can honestly say not one element of the plot caught me by surprise.

In all, the film seems to hover in tone and content somewhere between reality and the idealized world of the fable (say, a fable like The Green Mile, a movie by the same director). Many of the story elements seemed in one way or another contrived, which left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied and manipulated. Even good devices -- such as the well-known tendency of prisoners to become programmed by prison life, resulting in problems when they return to society (a syndrome referred to in the film as becoming ""institutionalized"") -- lose some of their power through a rather heavy-handed treatment. However, the climax of the story (although predictable) was very well-constructed and quite effective.

Regarding the acting, Tim Robbins is fair, but hardly awe-inspiring. On the other hand, Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors, is a rare talent who is almost certain to turn in a superb performance. This movie is no exception, and I believe if viewers think about it, they will realize that the strongest, most eloquent and moving portion of the movie is the last half hour in which his character, Red, is the focus of attention. The extended denouement almost saved the film for me, but for this viewer the movie reached its end with only a hint of the title's promised redemption.

For those of you who want to see a prison movie that is deeper, more profound, has better dialogue, plotting, and symbolism; and presents characters in now familiar roles (your assignment, compare and contrast!) but with considerably more substance and reality, check out Cool Hand Luke. It may not spell out what it's all supposed to mean in Shawshank's user-friendly, large-print narration, but it is nonetheless in all respects the superior movie.",10
"I have read tons of people getting off watching this pile of random prison drama, and I cannot believe this is the highest rated movie on IMDb.

I never liked Morgan Freeman. Really. He always plays the wise man in movies, and that is quite unbearable. Not only it jails him (lol) to a specific, unrisky role as an actor, but it's also outrageously pretentious. Tim Robbins is OK I guess.

So you get to see some fishy business involving cigarettes and rocks for two hours, spiced by some five-year-old melancholic philosophy.

End of story, If you like prison drama, go watch The Green Mile.

I wasted two hours so you won't, you're welcome.",10
Its a perfect example of a movie that never gets old. Love it.,10
"1994 was the year I was born. 20 years later I watched The Shawshank Redemption and do not regret it. It is truly one of the best movies of all time. I personally wouldn't put it as #1 in IMDb's top 250 list. There are a ton of movies that are on the same level as The Shawshank Redemption.

The story follows Andy Dufresne, a banker who is imprisoned for murdering his wife and her newfound lover. He claims he is innocent but is sentenced anyway. At Shawshank Prison, he meets and becomes friends with a man named Ellis Redding.

This entire movie revolves around their relationship as friends and the type of bond they formed while in prison. Both come from different backgrounds: Andy as a successful banker who is wrongly convicted, while Ellis is rightly convicted for murder. The movie has so much depth to these two characters and really fleshes them both out.

The Shawshank Redemption is also a very powerful, moving film. Watching the movie, a person might think of Andy Dufresne as a modern ""Jesus"" as to how he is able to convince all of the guards to allow several benefits for each of his friends he meets in prison. He is able to do all of this with no fear as he confronts the main guard Captain Hadley (played in a stunning performance by Clancy Brown). Who knew Dr. Crabs from Spongebob Squarepants could be this cruel.

As time goes on at Shawshank, Andy gains the favor of eventually all the guards and has them for protection against a group called The Sisters led by their leader Bogs. The warden even allows Andy to switch his job to help out other inmates in another part of the prison.

I must mention the other perfect performances of the other inmates. William Sadler plays Heywood, who is one of Ellis's group of inmates. James Whitmore plays the elderly Brooks Hatlen, who is the oldest member of Ellis's group. Honestly, these two actors have perfect performances. Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton is very sneaky and ruthless.

This movie will keep you guessing. Andy asks several times throughout the movie for different items. He gets them, but the viewer is clueless till the end of the movie. Andy does everything to make life at Shawshank enjoyable by doing various deeds throughout the film (despite the protests from the guards and the warden). He doesn't seem to care what others think and seems to do things for others.

In the second half of the movie, a new prisoner named Tommy Williams becomes part of Ellis's group. With the arrival of Tommy, truths are revealed.

I won't spoil anything about the ending, but Andy has one final surprise for everyone that will shock the viewers and everyone in Shawshank Prison. Like I said earlier in the review, the whole movie revolves around Andy and Ellis's friendship.

Stephen King created a novella called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption which Frank Darabont directed this in his first attempt as director.

Thank you Frank Darabont for creating this masterpiece. I also want to thank Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman for portraying Andy Dufresne and Ellis Redding respectively. Thank you Stephen King for writing the book. Thank you to everyone else who was involved in this.",10
"It is no surprise that this movie is simply tremendous. This review probably won't even be seen because so many people gave 10 star reviews. I guarantee that if you check the 1 star reviews there either won't be any or it will be a bunch of 6 year old's talking crap. I love this movie more than I should. And it is rare that a Stephen King movie is better than the book. This deserves so many rewards. The acting is phenomenal. And I can not even say that I found any flaws. If you haven't watched it already, (which you probably have.) I highly recommend it. If you are searching for a movie better than a book, here it is. It will not waste your time.",9
"I like this movie.It has a great-deep message about life,freedom and friendship.",10
"#2 favorite movie in the database? Mein Gott!! Surely you jest.

Big-budget marquee name rip-off of the ever popular naif-in-prison B-film standard. Except the B movies don't pretend they aren't going for the shock/schlock appeal.

Utter rubbish.",10
"Overrated. Drastically.

Tim Robbins is okay. Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman.",10
"The director definately knew what he was doing when he got the highly emotional and sad script on his desk: ""Deborah!? Get me the two actors in hollywood with the saddest faces, even when they're not crying! I have a tearjerker to make, and this time I won't take any chances!"" Joking aside; This movie is very very good, but it is not a 10! Please stop crying before you write your review... (also a joke)",9
"They say there are no perfect movies. Most of the time that holds true. But this is the one exception. I find no faults in The Shawshank Redemption. It is indeed a perfect film if ever there was one. It is wildly entertaining and extremely insightful. You won't want to blink for fear of missing something. You are able to identify and sympathize with the main character, and with his friend, who provides the greatest bits of narration of any film ever. This is not an exaggeration. Furthermore, we learn something about ourselves and our fellow human beings by watching this film. It is a work of art and a bit of real life. The production values are amazing. It should have won ten Oscars.",10
"Best movie. Must see. Engrossing. Great story, good acting, good direction.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption lost the Academy Award for Best Picture to the new visual effects technology utilized in Forrest Gump. In addition, Shawshank only made 10% of the box office gross as Gump, which received far more press coverage due to the visual effects used in the film. Gump is a great film and deserved the Oscar for visual effects, but its story does not compare to the brilliance of Shawshank. The ability to see Tom Hanks shaking hands with dead presidents in the White House amazed movie goers and the box office receipts amazed the Academy members. Shawshank is an amazing story and an outstanding film; whereas, Gump is a series of vignettes exploited by the new visual effects technology.",10
I love this film I don't know if it's Morgan freeman's voice or the acting or even the music it's all there but I know that it tells an amazing story.,1
"My impression is that since the early ninenties and especially after ""green fried tomatoes"" was released movies regarding human relations and/or tragedy and using narative as their spine became fashionable..Countless movies followed that i dont care to mention most of them inferior than the original they tried to follow and one of them is Shawshank redemption.Sure it is not a mellow love story but about life in prison that is objectively hard.But somehow the typical ingredients are there.The film is mostly sad and melodramatic and one can even consider it romantic in a way.Despite its strong cast and a good storyline it does not avoid all these characteristic cliches that sadly deprive it from any real replay value.Rent it on dvd and you wont be disapointed by viewing it but the second best movie of all times it aint and you will know this because you wont feel the need to watch it now and then as it happens at least to me with movies that are really classics...Not a bad movie but highly overrated....3 out of five stars.",10
"So the movie ends, credits roll and the music cues in. With the music comes attached a feeling and the feeling is a loud throb in my heart. And before the feeling fades, I wanted to write about it.

The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece in every way. Morgan Freeman's voice melts my heart. Acting is solid. Once the movie starts, its walls are new to you. Funny, how they make acquaintance of you and then a friend. The time passes, you think where did it go? For once it never felt cramped despite several themes flowing through per scene. It was smooth. Pace was incredible. Nearing the end, I wished it to last a little longer. Damn. I hoped. Because Hope is a good thing.

Ah, I'm institutionalized.

"This movie was excellence at it's best. In my mind, it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end. That's what this one did to me. Besides the point that the acting was some of the best you'll see in the 90's. The story was golden. If you haven't seen this, get it now.",5
"This is a great movie. At first, when I heard that Stephen King was one of the authors I didn't expect it to be this good, I don't enjoy horror movies but later I understood that it wasn't a horror movie so I watched it and I enjoyed every minute of it. Excellent performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.",10
Shawshank redemption is world's best movie ever made. I will remember this movie throughout my life. Pls pls watch this movie. It will change your perspective.,10
"Absolutely the best movie I have seen in my lifetime. I'm a hardcore action fan, but I sat and watched this movie and never checked the time. This movie is compelling. Tim Robbins gives a great performance nonetheless, but it is Morgan Freeman's character that adds such emotion to the movie. I always catch the movie on TNT and I watch it to the end. The end is fantastic, and it leaves me with tingles (if you know what I mean). Morgan Freeman's line ""Get busy living, or get busy dying..."" is one to remember. He adds so much feeling to the movie, and the entire thing is flawless. There isn't a line or scene out of place in the entire thing. I sat there thinking hard about the movie for a while, but then I got up and headed to the nearest shop. That movie was going to be my own.",10
"in my opinion ,it's better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale , so this time the escape is greater! and the hero is an ordinary man , who is so patient and hopeful, while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that it's social or silly story, but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong, it's a Brilliant Story,a never seen before , a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characters,like hating,and true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman,

I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....",10
"I struggle to find how people hate this film, it's their opinion and that's fair enough but I can't help but think they hate this film because of it's great reputation!

It probably is the greatest movie of all time. From the screenplay to the direction to the cast right to the Special Edition DVD cover art this film is genius!

So sad that it was overshadowed by two other films that year! I believe it must have been Forrest Gump at the Oscars and Pulp Fiction to the cool dudes! I think if someone can boast seeing Shawshank at the cinema deserves a medal!!!

Frank Darabont, Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman deserve all the praise they've received since and they've gone on to great careers.

I don't need to go on about the story etc because the majority know how good the film is.

If you haven't watched it where have you been?",6
"Best movie ever. I've seen it about 25 times now, and it never gets boring.",10
"This wasn't a bad movie by any means, in fact it was pretty good. Good story, good acting, fairly dramatic, it has most of the key elements in place. But after reading the book, which was amazing, watching this drawn out film version just isn't the same. Compared to some of the modern junk that's out there, Shawshank is pretty solid. But overall, it truly is overrated, and #2 all time is silly.",8
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",6
"I am dumbfounded by the exorbitant praise for this movie. It is almost frightening--like a cult. I watched it last night and was completely underwhelmed. This did not have have half the emotional charge of a dozen other prison flicks, not to mention other dramatic categories. Yes, the story was OK, good (not great) acting, but I found it to be largely insipid and predictable. It just did not grab me like other stories of redemption such as A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life. As you can see by my citing these two films, I am not offended by cheesy sentimentality, if well done. Shawshank simply had nothing new to say or a new way to say it. The only reason I am writing this review is to demonstrate that there are indeed some people who are not swept away by this movie. Otherwise, I would not have bothered. The film simply was not interesting enough.",10
"Share some of the sentences in this movie. 1.It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another. 2.Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.",10
"This is the #1. Absolute must see film of the 1990s, Our Generation, anyone's lifetime and quite possibly the history of film. Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster. Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise you'll wish to share it with everyone you know. Don't think ""another Prison Movie"" about-this one, it's above and beyond that cliché. Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, and James Whitmore. Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast. I Cannot emphasize-the importance of this film. I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece. It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day. thank you.",1
"Is there anyone who does not like this film? If there is, I've never met them. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film that doesn't sound too interesting when you first hear about it. A banker who protests his innocence after his wife and her lover are killed befriends a group of prisoners and changes everyone's life for the better. It does not sound that great to most people, but when you see this film you will honestly come away loving every frame of it. Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is greater, and the supporting cast are all perfect. William Sadler, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows stand out as well. James Whitmore, who has been in acting since the 1940s, gives his best performance as Brooks and should have at least received an Oscar nod. If you haven't seen this film go and see it. I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch on a rainy afternoon, or at anytime for that matter. Frank Darabont, who had been involved in horror films before this, became a big-time name after this film. Unfortunately, ""The Green Mile"" is nowhere close to comparing to this film which will be remembered forever. A great achievement. 5 stars out of 5.",10
"This movie is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella titled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". This movie is truly a masterpiece with the perfect casting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The lessons you learn, the emotions that were touched, the friendships that were made and overall, the redemption that every character got in their own way is what made this movie special. This movie teaches you about hope and institutionalization which means being stuck in one place for so long that it's all you ever know. It shows the darkness about being in prison. In conclusion, this movie is a 10/10. Hands down one of the greatest movies ever and I'll definitely rewatch it in the future.",10
"It's not a bad film. It's just derivative and melodramatic. It borrows from ""Cool Hand Luke,"" a superior film. It relishes its significance too much. It's a bit smug. Morgan Freeman's voiceover is a clumsy narrative device. I don't know -- I just know for sure it's not one of ""the best films of all time."" Not even close.",9
"The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.""",9
"When I first saw this movie in 1994, before the hype, I thought it was a passable flick; nothing special and certainly in keeping with the usual schmaltz expected from any non-horror Stephen King work. In fact, with the exception of Morgan Freeman's excellent performance, I found it imminently forgettable. Then, lo, came the Academy Awards with a surprising nomination for Best Picture. Then, even worse, came the belated hype from its legion of fans. I could not understand this adoration of a movie that was as sugar-coated as that other saccharine movie of 94, Forrest Gump. Worse than Gump's unpalatable cuteness, however, was Shawshank's genre clichés: the rape scene, the prisoner's pet, etc. Had no-one seen Escape From Alcatraz or Birdman of Alcatraz? For me, Shawshank is possibly the most overrated film ever made, a fact emphasised by its place at No. 2 in the IMDb top 250.",10
"What can I say about this movie; simply awesome, adorable, great, brilliant, excellent, the best ever movie I have seen in my entire life. Surely it is worth to be on the top for decades. When I got to know about this movie I watched it and to my surprise it was zillions time better than I thought. Even the new sensation ""The Dark Knight""(which is the best in its genre with the legendary acting by late Heath Ledger) could not match with this.I have watched movie so many times and even now not bored of it.

The greatest performances from the actors Morgan Freeman (who is my favorite actor) and Tim Robbins is worth a watch.The story had every thing about the prison life, the friendship bonding, about the HOPE(never to loose). The supporting cast was also very convincing and realistic.

I will give it 10 if I can will give it more than that.I suggest you all to watch it and am sure u will love........... it.............................",8

"The Shawshank Redemption is an exciting and very emotional excursion. It is the best ""jail"" movie ever made, for sure. There's suspense, surprises, and more, but it's true greatness is in it's show of the human spirit triumphing over impossible odds. With a pair of great actors and a very nice script, The Shawshank Redemption winds up getting a 10/10 from me.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is simply a brilliant and classic masterpiece. It received a lot of critical acclaim and was largely praised by the audience. And yes, it deserves all the praise.

The story: fantastic. The entire movie is superbly written, based on Stephen King's book ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"".

The acting: Amazing! Each and every actor in the film gives their best.

The soundtrack: The soundtrack can also be praised! The film is full of brilliant songs.

The direction: There is nothing to criticize in the directing either. That's really great too!

In conclusion, this is an amazingly good, very enjoyable and masterfully made film.",10
"Cannot see why this film is rated so highly. Sure, its watchable and nicely inoffensive, but its not really about much, and nothing really happens. Just a film about a bloke going to prison. Somewhere along the line I think I must have missed something, because I can think of at least a hundred better films. Saying that, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are flawless, though the latter's best film will always be the Hudsucker Proxy. (Which incidentally is a better film.)",10
"Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free. Some people's wings are so bright that even the darkest prison in the world cannot encircle them for a long time. This film tells a simple story, a redemption, in exchange for freedom. Besides the belief drive him to do so. This film is moving, it also makes many people grow up.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a story of, well, Redemption. Just like any film from Quentin Tarantino, but with an extra dose of melodrama. Orchestral music to drive you to tears, overly dramatic dialog, and plot twists that come so far out of left field even M. Night Shylamalan would cringe. You just have a hard time seeing them, because the movie is relatively laid back.

Which is the best part of the film. It slows down whenever it needs to take its time. It's the story of two prisoners who bond over. One is a wrongfully accused man hoping to find a way out. One is a man who has given up all hope. And random acts of kindness help them earn their redemption.

See, it's about Redemption. It's in the title. No use thinking about the theme. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast in this film, and gives one of the best performances in his life. But every one of his lines is not the line of a prisoner, but somebody who has been paid to pretend to be a prisoner.

The movie lacks any sense of reality, from the poorly supervised chain gang, to the subplot of the sinister warden, and even down to the fact that a man is allowed to keep a tool made for chipping away rocks in his cell.

The film would have worked as a stage play easily. Because we expect this detachment from reality. But this film likes to pretend this is reality. The film also likes to make conclusive statements, and then immediately retract them.

This movie has a heart. It spills out all over the screen while we watch the characters monologue, getting to the point of the movie over and over again. Long movies never bothered me. On the contrary, I think it's a shame four hour movies never get released these days. Still, when it's two and a half hours plus of monologues reiterating the same plot point, it's two and a half hours too much.",10
"Just finished watching this IMDB top rated movie, a staggering 9.3/10. Wonder how it scored such high ratings. Well I guess it's the seemingly simple yet unexpected and ultimately hopeful plot that makes it stand out. Even in the absence of mind blowing scenes like those in action movies 🎥 it paints a very thought 💭 provoking, soul searching and heart-wrenching yet eventually upbeat story. It is hope, yes hope, that finally helped the characters regain what should have belonged to them. And shall I say I particularly like the following quotes as they are so philosophical? It really requires a fair bit of thinking to truly immerse yourself into this movie.

1. ""Life comes down to a simple choice: You're either busy living or busy dying."" 2. ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""

Truly very well said, aren't they?",10

The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely terrific movie that shows why Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two of the finest actors alive today. I predict years from now Shawshank will be held up as a true American classic. This is a flawless film. My one regret is that I never saw this on the big screen. (I think the odd name 'Shawshank Redemption' and the fact that it was a Stephen King story kept me away initially [thank goodness for cable TV]) I urge anyone who reads this to please see this movie. It is the best film I have ever seen about life and hope.,7

What I dislike most about this movie is the typically boring people who say it's their favourite for no other reason other than it's what they think people want to hear. Thus making them appear less boring.

1 star because it needs knocking down a peg or 5.",10
"This is one of the best movies about ""friendship"" I've ever seen, also one of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redford's ""CASTLE"". Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish this couple come together for another movie, the kind of it is not important I'm sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his, normally he prefers to play in films like ""Seven"",""Kiss the girls"",""Along came a spider"",... but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts...",10
"Starring : Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore Directed by : Frank Darabont 1994 American drama directed by Frank Darabont walked without an Oscar to its name but had a lion's share in attaining critical acclaims and attracting the audience to it. This movie proves all its way that films devoid of Oscars can still be counted under a masterpiece. Set up in 1947, the film is about a smart banker Andy Dufresene is imprisoned for killing his own wife and her lover. Though he claims his innocence, he is thrown in a prison Shawshank where he befriends a smuggler Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding alias Red ( Morgan Freeman). The film exhibits different prisoners inside Shawshank and how Andy tends to befriend them all except the Sisters (that is what they are called ) who try to kill Andy just to have some little fun. The protagonist is shown up passing his time creating artistic stone carvings and watching sexy Hollywood actresses on the walls in his cell. The film takes u on the ride inside the prison where cops take up entirely over the souls and lives of prisoners. Andy being a banker is plunged into money laundering business by one of the cops and the warden. The warden himself as a man of principles but wait ! inside he is just money- hungry beast. Even with concept of an old prisoner Brooks ( Whitemore ) who has spent 50 years of his life in the prison and gets 'institutionalized' with it and ends up hanging himself to death when being released from Shawshanks adds up to the exciting plot of the film. The film is basically Andy's 20 years of imprisonment inside Shawshanks and his friendship with the fellow inmates and how things inside prison too also gets illegal sometimes. Shawshanks Redemption is a film which has a terrific ending. Watch it once and you will have an urge to watch it again.",7
"This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.

While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the ""standard"" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre.",8
"The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters. Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades. All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional. Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250.",8
"Morgan Freeman, in one of his most iconic roles, gives an outstanding performance as Red. His deep, soulful narration adds depth and emotional resonance to the film, making him the perfect choice for the character. Red's journey, as he transitions from a hardened criminal to a believer in redemption and hope, is beautifully portrayed by Freeman, and his chemistry with Robbins is nothing short of magical.

The supporting cast also shines, with memorable performances by Bob Gunton as the ruthless warden Norton and William Sadler as the sympathetic inmate Heywood. Each character in Shawshank State Penitentiary adds to the richness of the story, providing glimpses into the harsh realities of prison life and the transformative power of friendship.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a visually stunning film, thanks to the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins. The way he captures the starkness of the prison environment and juxtaposes it with moments of breathtaking beauty is a testament to his mastery of the craft. The film's iconic scenes, such as Andy's escape through the sewage pipe and his triumphant emergence into the pouring rain, are etched into cinematic history.

Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score further elevates the emotional impact of the film. His music weaves seamlessly with the narrative, enhancing the audience's connection to the characters and their struggles. The recurring motif of hope in the score becomes a character in itself, underscoring the film's central theme.

At its core, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a story about the enduring power of hope. Despite the bleak and oppressive environment of Shawshank State Penitentiary, Andy Dufresne's unwavering belief in the possibility of redemption and his determination to live life on his own terms serve as a beacon of hope for those around him. This theme resonates deeply with audiences, making the film a timeless classic that continues to inspire and uplift.

The film's emotional impact is profound, and it is impossible to watch it without being moved. Whether it's the camaraderie among the inmates during movie nights, the heartbreaking stories of fellow prisoners, or the moments of triumph and redemption, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" elicits a range of emotions, from tears to cheers.",10

PEOPLE USE RELIGION AS A COVER TO HIDE THEIR CRIME

These four key messages that I have derived from this movie. This is the highest-rated movie in IMDB. A simple storyline with no toe-curling or butterfly in the tummy feeling suspense, but after watching you will get more than that.

Shawshank is a penitentiary which is controlled by a religious, ruthless and corrupted warden named Norton (Bob Gunton). His henchman is captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), who shows no mercy to the prisoners in any situation and only knows how to punish them in more devilish ways. One day Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) arrives Shawshank as a convicted of murdering his wife and her illegitimate boyfriend. He sentences to double life imprisonment. He was a banker of a reputed bank in the country. He befriends with Red (Morgan Freeman) who has been there for a long time. Red appears many times in front of the parole board but every time he is rejected. He runs a gang in the jail area and in exchange for CIGARETTES, he supplies anything for the prisoners. One day, Andy demands a Hammer and a big poster of Rita Hayworth and agrees to pay as many cigarettes as Red wants. Red manages a hammer for Andy which is delivered by Brooks (James Whitmore), a fellow librarian of the prison who has been there for nearly 50 years. Andy is being bullied by some prisoners which leads him nearly dead, he has to stay at the prison hospital for a long time, When he comes back to his cell, he finds a big poster of Rita with a WELCOME NOTE from Red who gives him as a friendship gift. Andy involves with Brooks in the prison library and eventually proves his worth in the library. He manages to get funds and more books from the government after continuously pursuing through sending letters relentlessly. Also, with enormous skills in finance and banking, Andy proves his value to Warden and other officials by filling up their tax files. He also serves the Warden to hide his black money and hence Warden becomes quite faithful to him. Andy also keeps Red as his assistant to do documentation activities. After 19 years of prison, Andy once shares his feelings to Red about his dream to live in a Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town of the Pacific Ocean. People call this city as NO MEMORY and Andy believes that if he stays there, he would forget his sad memories. Red is frustrated and feels no hope to get paroled ever from this penitentiary. But, Andy convinces him that Red shouldn't lose his hope and instead he should make his hope alive. They remembered Brooks, who paroled a couple of years ago after serving 50 years in the prison, but he became too frustrated of the outside world and misses the Shawshank badly . He committed suicide and Red believes that like Brooks, he also becomes institutionalised. Andy also tells him that he didn't kill his wife and her illegitimate lover but he feels that he failed to express his depth of love to his wife in a proper way and that's why his wife committed adultery. Andy blames himself that because of him his wife committed adultery and eventually killed by someone.

WILL ANDY EVER GET OUT FROM THE PRISON? WILL RED EVER GET THE PAROLE FROM THE PRISON? WILL ANDY EVER STAY AT HIS DREAM PLACE THAT HE WANTS?

The Shawshank Redemption receives positive reviews from all critics and nominates 7 categories in the Oscar 1995 and 2 categories in the golden globe awards but didn't receive any of them.

The acting of Freeman and Robbins was remarkable. Also, the storyline contains lots of learning insights. If a movie watcher watches this movie with utmost concentration, s/he would get this movie as a good source of motivation",1
"This is the best drama that I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman was beyond amazing, and was one of my favorite aspects of the movie. The story was perfect. I genuinely cannot think of a single critique of this movie. I advise you to drop whatever you are doing and watch this now!",6
"On the outside, Frank Darabont's directorial piece de resistance does not look promising: Scripts purloined from little-known Stephen King novellas, hacked up and padded with sentimental Hollywood schmaltz do not tend to yield cinematic gold. King, a master of unnerving, psychological drama would never be so trite as to tag one of his stories with a vague, syrupy axiom like 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.'  that kind of corny meddling smacks of the ad men tugging mercilessly at the heart strings, ripping the freshness and originality out of every project they come across. I am also immediately wary of prison melodramas (especially those with the word 'redemption' in the title)  they are all so predictable.

These were my thoughts as I first contemplated watching The Shawshank Redemption almost a decade ago. Then there was nothing like the hype and fervour that surround the movie now. I had only the rapturous, breathless testimony of a friend of mine to go on, and he was something of a philistine when it came to the pictures (I believe his previous favourite film was Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, so you can forgive my scepticism).

Still I did some research before going in: Yup, thought so: Idealistic young man, banged up for a crime he didn't commit  I'll bet he soon bears the brunt of some pent-up sexual aggression from his misanthropic fellow inmates. What's that? He befriends an institutionalised black guy played by Morgan Freeman? I would imagine he'll be providing a wise voice-over throughout, perhaps whimsically tinged with an ingenuous Southern drawl. And the Warden: He'll be a stern, God-fearing fellow with steel-rimmed spectacles and a shady secret.

I went along and watched it anyway of course (my social diary as a teenager was hardly cram-full) and as I sat, I soon realized I was right on all counts. But still I watched. Past the grim depictions of new recruits being raped and beaten by both guard and lag; past the scene on the roof with the insurance advice and the ice-cold beers; past the bittersweet tale of Brooksy's freedom and Tommy Williams' fateful revelations. I watched through the ever-changing posters on Andy Dufresne's wall, and at the end I, like everybody else in the cinema emerged blinking, dry-of-mouth and my heart soaring.

Teenagers aren't supposed to be awash with optimism and joy. They slouch and scowl and lock themselves in their rooms with the stereo on full blast, but, despite myself, I couldn't take the big soppy grin off my face or shake the shiver from my spine. After watching The Shawshank Redemption, I smiled so hard my cheeks ached.

Because what cynical young sods like me didn't realize was that some films are formulaic for a reason. You cannot reinvent the wheel every time. What I also learnt was that redemption (when it is done right) can be the most moving and satisfying cinematic theme of them all. Shawshank excels in its simplicity. It is by no means the only great prison drama: Cool Hand Luke oozes, well cool, but the young Paul Newman was such a screen god that the film ends up being more of a slavish homage. Other prison revenge flicks (Murder in the First and Sleepers spring to mind) are more obsessed with action or courtroom finger pointing than any thoughtful resolution and the protagonists are bitter and angry.

Not here. The characterisation is crisp yet understated. Tim Robbins' Dufresne draws empathy and respect in equal measure, while Freeman's Red has an extraordinary dignity. When we meet him, he has served 20 years for a murder he committed as a kid and any angst and aggression has gradually ebbed away. Now he is revered as 'a man who can get things.' Inside his ability to procure contraband has made him influential  much more so than he ever was as a free man  but instead of using it to bully and menace his fellow cons, he sits back in quiet reflection. This is Red's redemption.

Dufresne meanwhile has a grander plan and it comes to fruition in the most splendid fashion. Unusually, we see it all through Red's eyes and that leaves us as wide-eyed and incredulous as the warden after he throws the pebble through Raquel Welsh's midriff.

I am not usually in favour of the retrospective voice-over. It is a lazy, mawkish device that is all to often used to paper over plot holes or lack of imagination. This one is different. I suppose it is all in the voice and Freeman sounds like he has been gargling with a heady mixture of rich New England soil and spitting whiskey. It is quiet but wholly convincing  much more so than his subsequent authoritative Presidential ramblings in Deep Impact. The language he uses is easy and uncomplicated but breathtakingly effective:

'His first night in the joint, Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes. He never made a sound,' he says when the new convict refuses to buckle, wryly encapsulating the intricacies of a friendship based on a mutual respect and true affection.

Who will ever forget Red as an old man 'so excited I can hardly sit still or hold a thought in my head' as he shuffles along the stone wall in the cornfield towards the big oak tree and Andy's hidden treasure  a true moment of silver screen magic. 'Get busy livin', or get busy dyin',' is the final maxim, and by that stage, no matter how cold or hard-nosed you purport to be, I defy you not to have a lump in your throat. Maybe for once the ad men got it right.

"Absolutely mind-blowing movie. Great script, direction and acting!",9
"Very good performances from Freeman and Robbins. Good writing. The best move ever? Nope. I gave it a 8 out of 10.

As a libertarian, my own feelings about freedom, power, and corruption are apparently quite a bit stronger than either Darabont or Stephen King.",10
"Best movie ever? Not even close. This is good movie, but there are 1000 good movies. Very few Great movies, and this certainly isn't great.

Like others have pointed out, way overrated.

Don't need to review it, as so many have already done. But I wanted to add another voice to the small group of people that acknowledge that it is getting way too much praise.

This doesn't even come close to both Godfather films.",3
I can watch this movie over and over.. Great work!!,9
"Can't believe it didn't win anything... Morgan Freeman was suoerb. He and Tim Robbins should win an award... and yes. This is how movie should be made. It touches your soul, make you feel good and grateful.",10
"Towards the end, dealing with Freeman's loneliness, I felt how he was feeling. These are believable criminals. People say these guys are too nice to be hard-core criminals, but people make mistakes. The guys' mistakes were on a big-time scale. One line will remain with me forever : Get busy livin, or get busy dying.

Well, Get busy watching or get busy goin';",10
"This is such a good movie! Excellent screenplay and directing. And the casting is fantastic; everyone just fit their part like a hand in glove. The whole story flows smoothly that you forget it's all make-believe.

I told one of my friends many times to watch this film and it took her years before she actually did. Once finished she said, ""What took me so long? This movie is soooo good!"".",9
"I read the short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" when I was in high school and enjoyed it quite a bit. I vaguely remember when this movie was in the theaters but I don't think anyone I know actually went to see it. Imagine my surprise, almost 10 years later, when it's rated the #2 movie ever made by IMDB users! Having finally had a chance to see the movie, I'm still just as surprised.

This isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. In some ways, it's a very good movie. But it's certainly not a great movie. Better than Casablanca? Better than Citizen Kane? Better than The Seven Samurai? I don't think so. As cornball melodrama, it's not even better than the first Star Wars. What could possibly account for this movie's inexplicable popularity?

As I say, it's not a bad movie. The acting is generally good, and Freeman and Robbins are both typically excellent. Roger Deakins' photography is, of course, gorgeous. The story itself is compelling (a ""page-turner""), as are most of Stephen King's stories.

Yet under it all, the story is just as much a fantasy as any of King's horror novels. While it's presented as a serious drama about prison life and the tenacity of the human spirit (and make no mistake, every emotion, every significant action in this movie is foreshadowed, highlighted and generally telegraphed to the degree that there's absolutely no doubt as to how the director expects you to react), the storyline and characters are so simplistically drawn that the movie wouldn't have rung significantly less true if an army of vampires had appeared in the final reel. This is a mawkish, sentimental and highly manipulative movie where the evil characters are pure, unadulturated evil and the good characters are the unsullied embodiment of pure nobility. It's the male equivalent of one of those Lifetime Channel movies where the woman's abusive boyfriend sleeps with her sister, steals her car, poisons her cat and kidnaps her developmentally disabled daughter to another state. It's pure melodrama, and while the great performances and photography make it enjoyable to watch, they can't change the fact that it is, Freeman's voice-over notwithstanding, a fairy tale.

It's hard to really care for anyone in this movie because the characters and their struggles are so completely cliched and cartoony. There never seems to be the least chance of Robbins' sprit being broken and the rest of the prisoners rarely seem any more perturbed by their incarceration than the prisoners on ""Hogan's Heroes"". There is something of a plot twist near the end, but it's telegraphed almost two hours in advance and there isn't really any question of the movie ending up any differently than it does. What we're left with is a beautifully-filmed, well-acted movie without the slightest hint of subtlety, nuance or ambiguity. This is the sort of movie where it's not enough to give the hypocritical, self-righteously religious warden a wall hanging that says ""His judgement cometh, and that right soon."" We also have to cut to a quick shot of the hanging right before the warden gets his comeuppance, just to make sure that not one single person in the audience misses the incredible irony.

It's supposed to be a celebration of the triumph of the spirit, but since there never seems to be the slightest chance that Robbins' spirit *won't* triumph, we're left with no more genuine suspense than we would get waiting for the cavalry to appear in an old-time western. What could have been an above-average B-movie has been turned into an overwrought, ham-handed, pretentious melodrama.",10
When you watching this movie you need that the keep your mind claim and relex yourself . And at the end movie teaches you that your plans never fail when you execute your plans with your 150% of 💯% that make you success in your life and your dreams come true.,10
"I have to admit I ignored this film in the 90's because I thought it was a violent film set in a prison with a bleak experience but seeing it last Holy Week, the movie moved and inspired me. The film was about Hope, Faith, Friendship and Determination and Guts, We have been prisoners of our own lives whether it be jobs, family life, social issues, you name it which becomes so routinary yet we never dared to grow further ahead that there are things outside our walls that are never discovered. This film teaches you that.

What use is our dreams, talents and positive outlook in life when we're not determined to push it further to the next level? It is really an inspiring film to watch over and over again, and something that you could share and teach to other people who have given up hope and faith. Indeed it quickly became one of my latest movie bibles of all time Whenever you feel hopeless and down watch this film and be revitalized to pursue your dreams and recover from your losses.

Get busy living or get busy dying.",10
"A very deep, very powerful actor, a very beautiful and engaging film that you don't tap into, and you enjoy it minute by minute, I advise you to take a pen and pen with you when you see this video to write down the tips that will teach you to use it later in your life. At the end of the film, you'll feel a real sense of freedom, and you'll feel all the sadness and sorrow you saw in the film, as if none had happened. To put it this way, it's all over. I strongly suggest it.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption can probably be accurately described as the king of the sleepers. For a good number of years now this film has routinely been included at the top or just off the top of best films of all time lists. Yet, unlike most others with that type of prestige, this film did not do well at the box office on initial release; it did get nominated for several Oscars but didn't actually win any. It was only once it was released on home video that its reputation began to grow and grow. Nowadays it's almost taken for granted that Shawshank is one of those films that many people consider their all time favourite. For me personally, I can't truly understand the magnitude of love that Shawshank engenders. I think it is certainly a great film though.

It's based on a Stephen King novella called 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. It's a prison drama and the story itself is quite straightforward. It's essentially about an innocent man incarcerated within a corrupt legal system. It has some well observed things to say about men being institutionalised and the direction is expertly handled – it takes it's time, keeps things simple but is never less than compelling. But what really makes this film work is the characterisations and the excellent script. There are two great central performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. They have a real chemistry together and you really believe in their friendship. In fact, it's friendship that Shawshank is effectively about. I think it's this factor more than any other that has helped it make such a wide connection with people.",10
"This film was totally amazing and is my favourite film of all time. This film humanizes the characters in prison which something we don't see in many Hollywood films as they dehumanize the prison characters. Also, it depicts the cruelt of prison very well and all the characters in this movie were amazing! Even the side characters were very engaging to watch. I actually tested up at the end of this movie. I strongly recommend this film to you if you haven't watched it yet",8
"What is so great about this movie? The question should be: ""What is not so great about it?"" And the answer would be: ""Nothing!""

The story is good, and the outcome is not obvious but great. The acting is superb all over the line. Tim Robbins is Andy Dufresne and we suffer and feel joy with him. Morgan Freeman is magnificent as Red, and when he is narrating it is like chocolate to the ears. He has so many great lines, most of which are quoted here, because they are worth remembering, like this: ""Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine."" The music by Thomas Newman is fantastic. It soars over the movie giving it the right mood, sad many times but it always fits in. I have just seen this movie for the fifth time, and it keeps getting better. I'm looking forward to seeing it again, when some time has passed. I know there will be something new to notice which is another reason why it is so great. I haven't talked to anyone that didn't like it, and with the number one spot on IMDb's top 250 most people must like/love this masterpiece. I haven't found any flaws in the history, though you can find some errors on the goof list. That Forest Gump ran off with the Oscar that year seems unfair to me and obviously to a lot of other people too.

Why only the second best movie? My absolute favorite is and will always be ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" I like This movie for some completely different reasons, like that I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood, Sergio Leone and spaghetti western. But with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" almost everyone I know agrees with me.

I hope there will come more movies like this, I hope many more people will see and enjoy this movie, I hope....",10
"Stephen King's stories usually do not translate well to movies (Carrie, The Running Man), but occasionally, a King story is done right (Shining, Stand By Me). This movie is probably the best of the group. It's a brilliant story matched with a brilliant screenplay. The cast was great from the professionals (Robbins, Freeman) to the relatively unknown actors. This movie is about a man's will to survive even when his future looks the darkest. One of my all time favorite movies.",7
"I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies. There is nothing new in this film and there isn't anything in it that makes it special. Wake up people! Quote Bill Hicks ""Piece of Sh*t"".

OK I'll give it that there isn't anything to complain about the acting or directing, etc. But this entire movie seems to be a compromise. I also think that the success of this film is based on the ""least worst principle"" and that makes it bad.

I'm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music. All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations. Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is? I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference.",10
"As I'm writing this, the Shawshank Redemption is at #1 on the IMDb Top 250. That means that IMDb users have given this movie a higher rating than the Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) movies, Forrest Gump (1994), Titanic (1997), etc. Is the Shawshank Redemption that good? Of course not, the IMDb Top 250 also puts Pulp Fiction (1994) and The Dark Knight (2008) above those movies. So personally I can't take the IMDb Top 250 very seriously. It differs greatly from the All-Time Box Office lists as well. So why is the voting behavior of IMDb users so different from the movies people in general like to watch in the cinema? The Shawshank Redemption, for example, didn't do so well in the cinemas. At the Academy Awards of 1995 the Shawshank Redemption was beaten by Forrest Gump and Forrest Gump has also done well at the Box Office. Yet in the IMDb Top 250 Forrest Gump is at #28 (as I'm writing this). So why are the differences so vast? In my opinion it has everything to do with hype, what people understand (for example, for non-Americans Forrest Gump is not as easy to understand as it is for Americans) and what people want to be popular. What's really surprising is that the Shawshank Redemption is not a movie about gays/pedophiles/anything sexual (like I Love You Phillip Morris (2009) or Mysterious Skin (2004)), drugs or mafia (like The Godfather (1972)), trashing Christianity (like Paul (2011)) or anything along those lines, which is what IMDb users are in general very fond of (as evident by the IMDb ratings of such movies). Although the Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie. So I guess it's ""cool"" to say that you like a prison movie, as opposed to a movie that is about an unintelligent man (Forrest Gump), romance (Titanic) or elves/dwarfs/hobbits (Lord of the Rings). Yet, I guess, it's not very ""cool"" to go see it in the cinema with your friends, due to the exposure of the friendship between two men (who are not gay).

Nonetheless, the Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie. It's in my opinion the best prison movie so far. One of the best movies ever? Nah, but still very good. The casting of the movie is also excellent. It's hard to imagine that anyone other than Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman could portray Andy Dufresne or Ellis Boyd Redding as perfectly as they have done. Everybody else in the movie has done an excellent job. The performances are awesome. The story is enjoyable. Definitely a recommended movie. Just don't expect it to be the best movie ever, as the IMDb Top 250 may make you believe. It's, after all, based on a Stephen King novel. Not that Stephen King is bad at what he is doing, but he is certainly no J.R.R. Tolkien. Combined with the director of the Shawshank Redepmtion, Frank Darabont, they are both certainly not James Cameron. The Shawshank Redemption is just an excellent movie and probably the best prison movie. That's it.",10
"I'm not saying that Shawshank Redemption is a bad movie, in some ways it's perfect. The storytelling is seamless and unquestionable, the characters are bright and strong. Villains with motivation. Heroes are not idiots. Events are justified by circumstances that push the heroes to independent actions. But my God, there are so many films that are so many times more worth your time and emotional energy that Shawshank Redemption is a quiet and meditative movie that is hard to watch at times. It's impossible for me personally to worry about characters that look so fake and created specifically for this story. They cannot be imagined in other circumstances, outside the picture. The lack of deep meanings and the possibility of different interpretations of the characters and what is happening is annoying. In general, he may just not be my type, but in the end it's just one of the opinions.",10
"when i began to watch this movie,i just said to myself,this should be the best i ever saw in my life,judging the IMDb rating and Kinopoisk rating!and it really haven't disappointed me! i learned,that if you want something so much,and the wish to achieve a thing or to get something is bigger and greater than anything else,this will obviously happen! there is nothing more important than to believe in yourself,to believe in justness, in the right choice of destiny! there are things that i disliked in the movie,but those awesome moments just overcome all the misses! I'm gonna watch it again...cause there still remain a lot of meanings and messages that i must follow! Hope is the best thing that can ever happen to you! never loose it!",10
"I think its obvious to anyone that has seen this movie that its quite possibly the best film ever. Its just perfect, iv watched it so many times but its gets better every time, in fact the last time i watched it, it brought a tear to my eye just as it finished. And i know, that sounds quite sad but, anyone who has seen film and understands the sheer quality of its brilliance! Don't get me wrong, there are other brilliant films but this this one stands out amongst all others, if you haven't seen this movie then i strongly advise that you make it your #1 priority.

"I love this film to bits, even though it can be hard to watch.",1
"I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it was about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes it is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I abnormal???????? I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that. I'm sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever, but I don't.",9
This is an amazing movie. I can watch it time and time and time again,6
"Hope is a powerful thing. Allow it to poison your mind and it will drive you to insanity; handle it with care and it will guide you to redemption.

The Shawshank Redemption is the story of a man, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who has been convicted of a crime he claims he did not commit – the gruesome double-murder of his wife and her secret lover in bed. He is sentenced for two lifetimes at Shawshank State Penitentiary, one for each murder. The lanky, soft-centered Dufresne is soon befriended by Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, another lifer, played magnificently by the prolific Morgan Freeman, who is also the narrator of the story.

What we see of Andy is through the eyes of Red. He is like the ocean – calm on the surface, yet seething from within. He isn't shown crying, begging for mercy or slipping into madness despite the fact that he is forever haunted by his past and desire for redemption. The relationship between the two men extends beyond just friendship – they are survivors who need the company of each other to make it through the hell they find themselves in.

But the movie is not just about their friendship or Andy's desire for redemption. The life in prison too has been displayed with remarkable empathy. You feel for Andy as his life is brutally altered forever. You feel for Red as he is repeatedly denied parole despite his immaculate behavior. You feel for the men vilified and ostracized by society who still have humanity left within them.

The performances by the two lead characters, Robbins and Freeman, are splendid. Robbins, in the shoes of Andy, touches you deeply with his soft-spoken, timid nature; but Freeman as Red steals the pie. His portrayal leaves a last impression on you and it is something you carry with you even after the end of the movie. His haunting voice brings life to the narrative as it resonates through the stony prison walls. He carries his character with ease, not once letting his acting look forced or contrived. I wouldn't be hesitant in stating that this is certainly one of his best performances till date – and that's saying of a man who has given breathtaking performances in Se7en, The Bucket List and the Batman series. The other characters too fit their places – the sadistic prison guard (Clancy Brown), the warden with rigid yet corrupt principles (Bob Gunton) and all the other inmates each with a personal life and voice of his own – nothing looks out of place. They work together like cogs of a well-oiled machine, or in this case, a desolate prison.

A feature that strikes you distinctly about the movie is the varying colour palettes. The hue of the film changes with the situation the protagonist finds himself in. They are associated with the mood of the scenario. When hope is bleak, the screen is predominantly grey which conveys a sense of helplessness. In the prison, shades of blue create a claustrophobic environment and overwhelm one with morbidity. At the same time, when Andy is happy, the settings are bright which helps develop an atmosphere of ebullience and joy.

The movie released in the same year as other masterpieces like Pulp Fiction, The Lion King and Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, it missed out on the Oscar to the latter, yet IMDb terms this as the best movie of all times. Despite the greatness of the movie, somehow I beg to differ with that. I believe that there cannot be one best movie of all times. This is a subjective area that varies with person and perception.

Where does hope come into the picture? Everywhere. Just as with Pandora's Box, when evil is overpowering, the only thing that remains is hope. Coupled with clever dialogue and heart wrenching moments, this movie reeks of emotions, out of which hope is the primary one. In the words of Andy Bufresne, 'there's something inside... that they can't get to, that they can't touch. That's yours.' It's hope.",10
"This movie when i see, i forget myself totally, very fine art, very creative, good acting performed by all characters. Special to the hero of the movie.",10
"It's boring, i don't care about the characters. Overrated to madness. The movie could have been way darker, feels like a disney adventure.

Great acting, ok story.",10

"Thought provoking and emotional, Shawshank Redemption remains as one of the greatest movies to grace the big screen and will always have a special place in my heart and mind.",10
"Frank Darabont has created a good film about the misuse of criminal justice system and the obnoxious corruption in prisons.He has done this by showing an insider's view of a penitentiary from the perspective of its inmates.Although Tim Robbins has a good role in this film as Andy,he is surpassed by Red played by Morgan Freeman.He is at the summit of his acting prowess as everything is written on his face.There is no other actor in Hollywood or elsewhere who could have done this role of Red with absolute conviction as Morgan Freeman. Shawshank Redeption tells us in clear terms that in prisons it is the rule of everyman for himself but sometimes there are exceptions. Feelings of suffering,sadness,trust,joy,companionship occur which give the prisoners the hope to carry on.It is nice that there is not much focus on feminine characters as they did not have anything that could have justified their presence.",9
"This has to be one of the only films that, if not actually hitting perfection definitely brushes it.

At first one would be wary of it I'm sure. A Stephen King novel about prison doesn't at first sound too stimulating (especially if you have watched Christine, a killer car cmon!) but it certainly does stimulate.

Even if you cannot understand or relate to the underlying message of conformity and institutionalisation that the script is getting across it doesn't matter as the characters are believable due to high quality acting on everyones part.

As my summary says perfection. The directing in this is perfect, every scene every shot seems to have been thought out to maximum potential. The acting is not over emotional like many a film is these days or not wooden like many other films are but its believable, emotions just right, every facial expression effective.

Though I'm more a fan of unconventional cinema that doesn't follow the standard Todorov form of thesis, anti-thesis and synthesis. This still strikes a chord with me because it seems to raise it's standards above that of the classic cinema standard.

All in all I will defend this movie till death as it really is one that you must watch. For those of you who have already watched it, I plead you to watch again.",10
"This movie takes you through all kinds of emotions. It's an absolute classic. And with the two wonderful protagonist actors, it's definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've watched it 3 or 4 times and never gets boring.",9
"I cant describe how amazing this movie is, but i dont have to because almost everyone saw it and if you havent... what are you waiting for? Probably the best movie on earth",10
"Andy has a better place is that he did not give up all the thinking in his outside life, he was not convinced by the institutionalized life in prison. In other words, he still insisted on his own heart and did not lose himself. This is the most important point of life. If you don't know why you are alive, it can only be a walking body, not an emotional person.",4
"This film, if it isn't one of the greatest of all time, at least I can say it is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This is a must-recommend, because to be honest, this is one of the many movies a movie lover must see before they die. It is not just a great film, but a great experience. And it is quite the experience! Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his career in this film. I give props to the director for making him narrate the film as well. He is just that great. Tim Robbins give a very underrated performance in this film. Freeman stole the show, but there was a certain subtlety of Robbins' that can't go without being recognized. Either way, both these men give their full effort into this film. There is a great atmosphere around this film as well, it's a subtle tone, as this is a subtle, (But great) film, but it changes when it needs to change, and it knows exactly when. As a matter-of-fact, what makes this movie great is that it knows exactly when it needs to do something powerful, thoughtful or sentimental, and to be honest as a moviegoer, that is all I can ask for.",8
"Look, usually I'm not a fan of classics. Godfather is boring. Star Wars is fun, but there are better fantasy movies. 2001: A Space Odyssey is far longer than it needs to be. With most classics, I appreciate how groundbreaking they were at the time and am happy for their contributions to film history, but I personally don't enjoy them as much as some of my more recent favorites. Shawshank is a wonderful exception. Every part of this movie is enjoyable thanks to the clever dialogue and great acting. Unlike things such as Casablanca, which aren't very fun but are enjoyable because you can appreciate the character's resolve and character, Shawshank is fun. Even though it takes place in a prison, you enjoy watching Andy slowly climb his way up the ladder and use his knowledge to maneuver his way around everyone. It's a blast. As a result, it's never boring. That being said, the movie truly shines because it has one of the best, if not the best, endings in movie history. It's not only completely satisfying, but downright epic. Everything fits into place perfectly, and the result is the beautiful combination of inspiring and heartwarming. Even though it's been parodied into oblivion, I'm happy to say I didn't many of the twists coming. The title is fitting: this is a movie about redemption, about being put in a terrible situation and coming out on top. It's truly wonderful and a movie everyone should see.",8
"Reading through the comments by other contributors here, I begin to realise the reason why this movie features in so many all time top 10s - the film means different things to different people.

As straightforward prison drama it is head and shoulders above others of its type - an epic story told with sensitivity and emotion, superbly acted and brilliantly shot. What makes what would have been a good film into a great one is the subtexts and themes which run through it that allow the viewer to actually think.

Personally, my more recent viewings of the movie have highlighted the religious subtext - the way that Red is influenced to 'get busy livin' (and find his way to the Promised Land) as a result of meeting Andy, the Crucifixion/Resurrection/Redemption metaphor of Andy's escape as he stands with his arms wide letting the rain wash away everyone else's sh*t/sins.

To be honest, I hate it when people try to look too deeply into art and identify supposed meaning of which the artist probably had no intention at all. I might be way off with these religious musings but the fact that I have been stirred to comment on them merely reinforces the power of this movie in the way that it can move us.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic gem that transcends time and genre, leaving an indelible mark on the world of film. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this 1994 classic is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and the enduring power of hope.

Set within the bleak walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins), a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit. His transformation from a quiet and introverted banker into a resilient and intelligent inmate is nothing short of captivating. The heart of the story lies in the profound friendship he forges with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding, portrayed with unparalleled depth by Morgan Freeman. Freeman's narration, as Red, adds a layer of gravitas to the film, making it impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.

At its core, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a testament to the human spirit's ability to endure, to find purpose even in the most dire circumstances, and to maintain hope when all seems lost. The film beautifully explores themes of friendship, redemption, and the quest for freedom, all against the backdrop of a stark and unforgiving prison environment.

The supporting cast is nothing short of exceptional, with standout performances from Bob Gunton as the ruthless Warden Norton and William Sadler as the tragic Heywood. The script, penned by Darabont himself, is a masterpiece of dialogue, seamlessly blending moments of humor with profound wisdom.

Visually, Roger Deakins' cinematography captures the essence of both confinement and liberation. The iconic scene of Andy's escape through a sewage pipe during a thunderstorm remains etched in cinematic history, a symbol of rebirth and the triumph of the human spirit.

Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score complements the narrative, stirring emotions and adding depth to the characters' journeys. The soundtrack, featuring classics like ""Duettino - Sull'aria"" from Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro,"" further enhances the film's emotional impact.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless classic that invites repeated viewings, as its layers of nuance and symbolism reveal themselves with each watch. It is a film that can make you laugh, cry, and reflect on the human condition, all in the span of 142 minutes.

In conclusion, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not just a movie; it is an experience. Its enduring popularity and critical acclaim are a testament to its exceptional storytelling, powerful performances, and profound themes. This film has earned its place among the greatest in cinematic history and remains a must-see for audiences of all generations. Don't miss the opportunity to witness this masterpiece unfold on screen-it's an experience you won't soon forget.",5
"I wait for the day when this film is no longer in the top 200 of IMDb, as it deserves. Please, if any film was passed over in favor of Gump at the 1995 Oscars--it was the best film of the nineties--PULP FICTION.",10
"I had heard about the movie since it first came out, but somehow, I never got around to watching it. Now, I super-glad that I watched it. It is an utterly fantastic movie, to the max. The movie contains almost every human emotion that there is, and overall, it is a totally wonderful character study, as well. There is marvelous writing, and a totally well thought-out plot, and the acting talent throughout is on an almost otherworldly level. It is a movie that captured my attention from the very beginning, keeping me totally engaged throughout for the entire duration of the film. All said, this is yet another movie that I truly wish that I could give more than ten stars, because it truly deserves many, many stars.",10
"So i watched this film maybe 10 times Russian version, 5 original English. Read both book versions. It's beautiful story! When i have watched this film first time, after started to follow the career of the actor Morgan Freeman. He is a great actor. I give the film 10 stars",10
Well there's not much you can say about this movie except that it is the Best movie of all time and no other Movie will top this great Great movie If you have not seen it sit back clear your mind and watch it and make sure you are not bothered while watching it that way you can fully understand the film and its purpose.So out of a 1-10 scale I give it a 10+++++++ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT RENT IT!!!!!!!!,10
"I'm not sure Shawshank Redemption deserves to be considered the best film of all-time, personally I'm not sure I would even have it in the top 50. Regardless, this is still a majestic and thoroughly entertaining movie with an unforgettable finale. The lead performances from both Robbins and Freeman are career-defining and help make the film so memorable.",10
This movie proves its worth of having top spot on IMDb list.It is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.Great acting displayed by lead actors specially Morgan freeman.Truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.Dialouges of this film are well written. You will miss something if HAVE not watch it. Highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.I will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.Like godfather.Godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.,10
This film is a masterpiece and clearly deserved 10/10,1
"I'm constantly amazed by the praise heaped on this film. I've always seen it as a good film, but too clichéd to rate as as truly great one.

On the plus side, it has high production values, has a good performance from Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and it's well-paced until close to the end.

But the downsides are legion.

First of all, some of the secondary characters are utterly two-dimensional (particularly Warden Norton and Captain Hadley). They lumber through the film as such obvious and simplistic bad guys that they may as well have moustaches and wear black hats.

Secondly, the film cranks out every prison cliché in the book. The assaults, the corrupt wardens, the ex-con who can't handle the outside world, the withdrawals of privileges - all have been done before and with considerably more impact.

Thirdly, there are plot holes you could crawl through (as Andy does!). The notion that Andy Dufresne could dig a tunnel for 20 years without being spotted isn't up-lifting, it's ridiculous. Did no-one feel the draught? Did no-one lean against the poster when they visited him in his cell? As a resolution, it's not clever, just silly.

And the finale (from the tunnel to the beach) is overlong and overwrought.

And yet there are standout sequences. The scene where Andy locks himself into the Warden's office and blasts an aria from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro over the prison Tannoy is sublime and haunting.

An enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but no more than that.",10
"Wait, no it isn't. I have a hard time understanding why this movie is rated at #2 on IMDb. The acting is good, I'll give you that, but it's inexplicable how a standard prison drama that hauls every cliché out of the book has enchanted so many people. I mean really, does it say anything new? Have any of its images or dialog made their way into pop culture (the sure sign of an influential film)? No and no. When you really look at it, this is actually a pretty boring movie, and the sleep-inducing musical score doesn't help.

The most objectionable thing about this movie is how the convicts are made to be funny, humorous, engaging. I assure you that if you ever stepped foot into a prison, they won't be anything like the characters you see in the movie. They are in prison for a reason, usually because they are uncontrollably violent, anti-social, and manipulative. They are killers and rapists, thieves, inhuman monsters; putting a friendly face on them does a disservice to the people who worked so hard to get them in there. The sheeple who love this movie are the same kind of people who were hoodwinked into believing that Robert Stroud (the Birdman of Alcatraz) was a quiet, gentle, kindly man because of the movie they made about him. In actuality, Stroud was just the opposite: he was a bitter, violent, poisonous little man who wrote detailed child porn. It doesn't help that Andy's innocence is never shown, it's only implied. Why should I root for a man who might have killed his wife, if they won't show that he didn't do it? The only thing Andy has going for him is a convict in another prison who confessed to the crime. It's not enough for me to believe in his innocence.

I guess Morgan Freeman's soothing, grandfatherly narration, Andy's cavorting on a Mexican beach, and the warden's desperate final denouement might all have something to do with the popularity of this standard prison movie, but like I said it's all been done before, and to better effect, in other movies. As an example, James Cagney's howl of despair when he learns his mother dies in ""White Heat"" is an electrifying moment, and is loaded with more humanity than the icy and distant Shawshank Redemption.",4
"I watched this film several times and I am fascinated with it today as I was then when I watched it. Everything is top of the line. Acting, plot, camera, everything.

Plot involving jail in 1940s is really an interesting plot and characters are really colorful. I think that was one of the films when Morgan Freeman came to fame. Other actors are fantastic too. This story is timeless and it will probably be watched many times over and over again by many people in the future.

However, I am not sure that it deserves to be number one on IMDb top 250 films of all times. I would put Schindler*s list there rather then this film. But that is just me.",10
"I'm way too astonished to find THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION at the top of the rankings list. Maybe it's because TITANIC got your tongues!

This is a very satisfying tale about prison life that develops friendships and painful moments, with solid performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It's disturbing to mention a couple of major flaws I've noticed in spending 2-1/2 hours of silver screen magic. Lengthy time is just one of them. Another is that certain scenes quickly lose your interest, while others are so interesting that you can't help but sit back and enjoy them with the pleasure of comfort. Just draw a line graph inside your head and notice how the levels get screwed as time progresses. Same thing with those machines that measure waves of earthquake intensities. I'm not being too complex, but I think this is a good comparison to what the movie accomplished in general. So much for the harsh part...

With good intentions, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION gets better and better at the conclusion, which is by far the most impressive I've witnessed. We must think of this film, as a whole, a true part of escaping society's problems, the definite basis of what it really means. Freeman's narration contributes to the story with thought, and Robbins does exceptionally well as a con who awaits the splendor of freedom. Stephen King did an adequate enough job in writing a book that escapes horror. Prison flicks usually are straightforward, but there is higher emphasis on its ideal writing, a crucially vital element in good filmmaking standards.

So while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has some pros and cons, it is a natural and redeeming look at the pains and friendships that any living soul can accept or caress. It isn't THE greatest movie ever filmed, but stands out as a Hollywood classic that will see future years for the whole world to crave.

Then again, I did not say TITANIC ""is"" the greatest...",10
"What a complete masterpiece this film is, from the first line spoken to the zoom-out in the end. The actors are all great, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do outstanding performances. This is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasn't seen it there's only one thing I can say: Please do! You won't be disappointed.",10
It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Out of my top 5 worst movies this would be in at least the top 3 movies I hate. It is just so boring and everytime I turn on TNN or something it is on! By far one of the worst movies ever!,10
"Let me just say that I liked the movie. I love Freeman, I respect Robbins. Reading King. But the review is red. I explain:

In the IMDB list (as well as on Kinopoisk), films often float, sometimes climbing to second place in the list, and then dropping to one hundred and ninety-third, etc. The picture is changing. But one thing remains the same: The Shawshank Redemption comes first.

The site has almost the entire filmography of mankind, but this story remains the best. Yes, the story is good, as is the setting of the film. But is this the best thing that the world has created in more than a century of work? Is that what worries people? The most pressing? Deeper than 'Forrest Gump'? More classic than the tacitly declared must see 'Titanic'?",3
"An UNDER-RATED movie?? Gimme a break! This is one of the most over-rated movies on IMDB! 8.7, what a joke! This movie is boring, plain and simple. You want to watch a movie 5 times so that you can put the pieces together and finally get it, fine. I'd rather watch a movie that was actually more entertaining than a jigsaw puzzle.",1
"Off the hop, I don't mean to upset people with a 9 out of 10 rating. In my world, nobody gets a 10; there is always room for improvement. Mind you, this movie comes very very close to a 10.

I knew nothing of the movie before watching it and was picking my jaw up off the floor upon completion. The amount of situations and experiences I could relate to and empathize with was incredible. The simplicity of the message within the complication of human interaction and misunderstanding. It was a shocker. The extent of rawness people can portray towards each other versus the compassion was wound together like yin and yang. We can't really have one without the other.

Since, I have seen this movie several times. Each time, I still find something new to ponder if it was intentionally placed, or just happens to fit.

I highly recommend this movie to believe in the power of the human spirit and magnitude of motivation brought on by friends.",10
"This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work. The direction of it is exquisite (and gives much to Tim Robbins character, I know he is a good actor, but the direction gives so much more to him). The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite (thanks to Stephen King). I have seen many greats, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now....etc. This movie is fantastic, and the fact it didnt' win (or even get nominated) for an Oscar is the reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars anymore. This movie is fantastic, and an artistic triumph. I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick.",10
"The Movie is all about living in Earth Planet and how to Survive in Big cities!

I found it awesome and for sure will watch it every few months with Friends and Pets!",7
Not so nice and boring. They have to get better with their movies,10
"Let me analyze why people keep giving 10 points to this film. I think most of them were bedazzled by its top position on IMDB and cannot make an independent judgement. They pick it as their best film, because millions of people cannot be wrong. Most of them were drifted by the wind; some took the bull run as in a crypto market, and some were just railroaded. But I don't blame them. I was impressed by this film so much when I first watched it on TV many years ago. I was around 18 years old back then. It was one of my favorite films and IMDB didn't exist back then.

Through years, I have viewed and reviewed many films. One can seek many criteria when evaluating a film, but for me, rationality and consistency have become important criteria. And in this film, there are some scenes that came to me quite irrational, such as the scene in which convicts drink beer on the rooftop, or the one with Andy playing Mozart from speakers. Previously, a convict was beaten to death just for crying in his cell on his first day in prison. Moreover, the plot is highly contrived and this manifests itself in the character of Andy. He was made too stoic that he seems to foresee the outcome of everything. Such heroic characters appeal more to children. Maybe I am too old to buy that. His makeup is not consistent either. He gets old and then young again.

On the upside, Morgan Freeman's performance is outstanding. He portrays a real convict and delivers a delightful narration. Moreover, the film has an intense wish fulfillment in the ending. Overall, I can say that this is a nice film but not the best.",3
"I still don't understand what these two Italian women are singing today. As a matter of fact, I don't want to understand. Some things are better not to say. I think it's a non-descriptive beauty. But it hurts you so much.

The voice flew high into the clouds, more than any prisoner in prison, like a beautiful bird, flying into the gray birdcage, so that the walls disappeared, so that all prisoners in the iron window, feel a moment of freedom.

When Andy desperate to put ""Figaro's wedding"" (Le Nozze di Figaro) in the prison horn, the camera slowly scratched through the prisoners and guards who were in the wind in the square. They stood still, moving away from all resentment, vendetta and resentment, bathed in the sun I had never felt so free. Mozart's music spread on these people, and wonderful notes from the earthly world seemed to wash them all pure.

The strong save themselves, the holy save the man. That's why I understand what Andy means. When he repaired the roof, he won beer for everyone, in fact, the feeling of being as free as repairing his own roof, so he did not drink, but smiled with great happiness; Figaro's wedding was also to awaken their lost sense of freedom.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a 1994 American drama film directed by Frank Darabont. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, he befriends fellow inmate Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and uses his financial knowledge to assist the corrupt warden. The movie is about the power of hope, friendship, and redemption.

The movie is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made due to its exceptional direction, outstanding characters, and storytelling. Frank Darabont's direction is masterful, creating a visually stunning and emotionally gripping film. The characters are well-developed and portrayed by exceptional actors, particularly Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The film's themes of hope and redemption resonate with viewers, making it a timeless classic. The script is also exceptional, with its tightly woven plot, memorable dialogue, and excellent pacing, making it a film that consistently delivers from start to finish. Overall, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences to this day.",1
"I really recommend this MP. I thank all the casting, directors, producers, writers and other staff for crafting this unforgettable movie. I give 10/10 for leaving a smile on my face at the end and joy in my heart. Thank you!",9
"Amazing, must watch for everyone! Simple but touching.",8
"I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film is.

You've probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of 'IMDB's top 250', or maybe you've heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be half-decent. I can assure you this will live up to your expectations. The acting, the plot, the setting, the cast, the directing, the messages and symbols, the acting again (deserves another mention) is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting. Please don't waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because, I can assure you, you can. Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online - I really don't care - just make sure you watch this film before anything else. As an 18-year-old guy, I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. Go watch it! Now!",8
"It makes you feel stuff. This movie makes you feel emotion. It's awesome, a classic, and really not that overrated",10
"""Redemption by Shawshank"" turns life into a cruel choice. Shawshank's redemption is something we have to remember repeatedly in our simple lives. Believing in yourself, not giving up hope, giving up effort, and waiting patiently for your own glory in life, is Shawshank's redemption.",10
"This is a classic about hope. Hope is not in prison. The owner, gong'an Di, was misunderstood and imprisoned. Relying on his inner firmness, he saved his life with wisdom and hope, saved the prison with a small hammer, and sowed the seeds of hope into everyone's heart.",10
"My fourth time watching, but maybe the first time that I truly connected with its story and characters. The other times I felt that it was an ok movie, whereas now I would say it's better then ok. It's actually quite good. Though I do not believe that it's a 10 out of 10, nor worthy of IMBds top spot in the 250. Yet, I can certainly understand why the film would move and inspire so many. It is such a bitter and sweet story. Which, in the end, is more about the power of friendship, then anything else.

Yet it also mis-steps in a few places; which made it just that less enjoyable for me personally. I am thinking especially of the scenes involving the young convict who tells Andy the identity of his wife's killer, and the Warden then having the young convict murdered. That whole section seemed to clang in a story that otherwise seemed to flow nicely.

Overall though pretty damn entertaing, with a truly memorable ending.

(The 1 out of 10s that some people have chosen to give it, is generally nonsense I would say.)",10
"A story about friendship and hope. Every minute of this movie will keep you intrigued and wanting more, a movie you will never want to finish. There are two movies to me that are perfect 10's, Goodfellas and Shawshank Redemption. Enjoy.",10
"I have to say that it was just fine, but not as great as some are making it to be.",10
"In the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday afternoon I knew it was my favorite. I was captured instantly by how the story unfolded. You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't know if thats spelled correctly). The way he speaks with thought and hope, the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks. Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail. They couldn't have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman. His voice is perfect for the narration of the film. Every card played by this movie was an ace. From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not forget the music. I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I think it deserves it.",10
"I'll keep this short and sweet. I am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. However, I didn't think I would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. I have to honestly say that I was impressed by the directing, acting and overall story. This is a great move! You should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This story has structure, purpose and meaning. Though, if you can't sit still then don't bother. However, I do think it's time we get some culture back in our lives.",10
"This movie doesn't deserve a 10, it deserves a 11...

This is the best movie I ever saw, everything on the movie is great, the story, the acting, the message, just everything. I spoke with so many people that saw this movie, and everyone of them said that The Shawshak Redemption is a truly masterpiece.

If someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you haven't yet, because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. It is the best rated movie (9.2) and when I see that rating Im just asking myself ""why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10??",10
"After I have seen this movie over a dozen times, in different phases of my life, I can help you by saying this is a milestone to have, not only as a movie fan, as well as a person to see, in this story, that hope is the last and first resource. More than twenty years after I saw this for the first time, I can still remember how I felt then and still share the same emotion now that I am a father and an adult with a consciousness of life. Yes, this is entertainment but also something to witness. Regards to everyone involved in the making of this touching masterpiece.",6
"This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.

There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is.",10

One of the top movies i have ever watch! Must seen!,9
"There are very few films that leave me in tears and make me reflect upon life in an extremely meaningful and profound way, and by God if Shawshank hasn't been the best.

Speaking as quite a young film enthusiast, I prefer more modern films in general; I can appreciate the classics in their period of release, but I think that we need to move on in order to advance and become more sophisticated in art. I see people reeling off their favourite films from decades past, past horror films, action films etc, and I think the standard of films has risen so much over the past few years that the only thing that makes some the classics seem tolerable is nostalgia. Watch 'The Exorcist' or 'Star Wars' now and although you can see why it was so popular, compared to their modern-day equivalents they don't exactly blow your mind. This may seem naive, but I detest the notion that because something was done first, it must be the best at it - we learn from the past to move forward. But watching Shawshank, I wouldn't mind if things stayed that way. There is nothing wasteful in this film at all. Every single line, expression, scene and shot has significance in the message that overrides the whole production.

I'm just gushing now and I haven't even said much about the film, but the fact that I was made to consider all this and then be compelled to write about it, is proof enough of this film's worth. No matter who you are, or where you come from or what you like, Shawshank will touch you - it will make you laugh, cry and marvel at such excellence that is nothing short of film-making perfection.

No-one reads the reviews for this film other than to confirm what they already knew - that this film is a masterpiece, and that it demands recognition, so if by a minute chance you are reading this without watching it, erase this review from your memory and watch it fresh eyes.

I thought this film was going to be a mediocre-fest that snobbish critics drool over because of the word 'Redemption' in the title. And that's the best way to watch it. Underestimate it, so that when it blows your mind you can sit back and slap yourself in the face for not already having seen it. And if you didn't feel that way after seeing, I suppose you can just go back and re-watch Michael Bay's Tranformers for the fifteenth time.",6
"Not that I have been known to admire the critical pieces of work in Hollywood/Bollywood (I would have aliens and zombies any day); I did love the cinematic motif called the 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Much has been already written about the movie and most of it would definitely have been more effusive, more spirited, more detailed than what I am about to write. But one more good review won't do it no bad, and I promise to be - to the point if not short, so that you would by now have determinedly made your mind to watch it. Well, what can I say, it is based on a novella written by Stephen King, a prolific writer suffering from highly activated carbon of imagination and a severe bout of literary diarrhea. He writes definitely long prose, that to good, but of course I have known him long enough just to give the chills. But it has indeed given me pleasant surprise to find out that he has taken out his time to write novellas/novels like 'Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Green Mile'. The latter, to tell you the truth, I haven't yet completed reading, it has been in limbo for some two-three years, but though I don't care much about them, has received pleasant reviews indeed. Now to the movie - except for Morgan Freeman, the star cast was pretty much unknown to me. But of course, great acting surpasses popularity. Each and every character of this movie had acted natural, without affectations, delivering masterful strokes, making this movie seamless and without even a protruded bump in its fluidic path. Of course, it has a great story to back on. Andy Dufresne is wrongly accused (as later in the movie, it is incontrovertibly proved) of a crime of passion and is convicted to a life sentence for the murder of two in a prison called Shawshank. Amidst the usual bets, about which of the new inmates would break down on the very first day (the old-timers call them their race horses), Andy comes in last. A cold-blooded fish, he is assumed to be, by his inmates ""Red"" (who considers himself to be Irish!), Bob and the rest of the ""Red"" Riding Hoods, but soon enough, Andy earns their respect by going an extra mile (and also to protect himself from some hostile elements) and bravely puts up with the seriously dangerous warden (Bob Gunton) and his gun toting whelp of a chief guard (Clancy Brown). He soon enough finds himself much in demand! But seriously, life in prison is hell. Be it the description of Arthur Road Jail (Shantaram!) or Shawshank in this movie, they all give me jeepers. After vicariously experiencing life in jail, I am always like, 'God, let me not commit any crime so notorious that it lands me at this concrete hell'. Frank Darabont and Stephen King have covered it all – be it the doublespeak that the warden indulges into, the plight of institutionalized prisoners and the sheer rottenness of the place. Amidst all that gloominess, like a tiny flicker, a scintilla of hope somehow survives in the form of Andy. Truly this movie is one of the best critically acclaimed (Imdb!) movie I have seen so far And to think that Rita Hayworth, the American beauty to be at the center of it all!!",1
"Shawshank Redemption narrates a beautiful story of two prisoners bonding over the number of years. Their experiences in the prison and the chemistry between two (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) have been shot with terrific care.Editing and Screenplay of this movie are among the best in any movie you will see.

The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently.

Overall, this is the sort of movie you will remember for long time and a benchmark among the ""feel good"" movies. MUST WATCH.",10
An enduring piece of art that will change certain aspects of the way you think for the rest of your life. That's all.,10
"I saw this movie few years back.i was immature, i didn't get what this movie was offering True Meaning Of Friendship,Patience, to see every Perspective of turns whether its hard or not we face during our lifetime.. Really a strong movie must watch",10
The shawshank redemption is probably the one of the best films ever depicted in cinematic form. It is the most controversial and sad film I've ever seen; second is American history x. I loved this film and I thought Tim Robbins was excellent and Morgan Freeman as well. Let me just say to that everybody should see this film. I give it 4/4,1
"Let's be honest, it's a fairly mediocre movie. Entertaining, I'll grant you, but profound? No way. Not much here in terms of innovative or even creative film-making either.

Is it one of the most popular films of all time? Probably. At least of recent time. Is it the greatest film ever made? Don't make me laugh.

That said, I'm glad people can enjoy this movie. I won't watch it again, but I don't exactly regret it.",7
"Good movie but 9 is too extreme, is certainly one of the masterpieces of cinema, but like many Hollywood movies there is some bad things, when the protagonist moves down the sewer pipe, in reality it would be caught bad. A very nice movie that you can refer to the way that each of us must do just to get out of certain problems. After all you put poor grades to great films, especially horror. Hardly comes out of jail in a tunnel of excrement, jail and violence and degradation but you can get out mainly in Italy. However great interpretation of Morgan Freeman, many sentences are historical and should keep in mind. In the movies there must be some humanity in this film there is too much violence",10
"While a successful writer, Stephen King has a bad reputation when it comes to the film versions of his work. ""Children of the Corn"" and ""Maximum Overdrive"" are some of the most frequently cited examples of how difficult his stories are to translate to film. Granted, there have been exceptions, such as ""Misery"" and ""The Green Mile,"" that have won critical and commercial acclaim, but these are relatively few and far in-between. As a rule, his non-horror writings tend to work better on celluloid. Still, no one, not even King himself, could have predicted the overwhelming praise bestowed upon ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" helmed by a then-unknown director.

If you're looking for cheap thrills and ""boo"" moments, you won't find them here. Unlike Darabont's ""Green Mile,"" there are not even any elements of the supernatural. The focus is on the relationship between a man wrongfully imprisoned, and the inmate he befriends. In later scenes, the story takes some intriguing twists and turns, in classic Stephen King fashion. What happens I will not reveal, but the screenplay is clever at making everything come together in the end. Despite the grimness of prison life, all is not lost. In fact, one marvels at how Andy did such a good job in making the best of his situation.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver subtle but effective performances, making everything absolutely believable. Kudos, also, to the fine supporting performances of Bob Gunton and William Sadler.

So far, this is the best Stephen King film I've seen.

***1/2 (out of ****)

Released by Castle Rock through Columbia Pictures",10
"The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. An absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. If you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead, nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. Everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. I have watched it for many times, at least ten times I guess. Now I hope I can download it and keep it and enjoy it once I have time. I used it to encourage people around me, for example, a girl friend who's suffering from the depression, a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet, and a friend who lost his job recently.",10
"Entertaining prison melodrama, overwhelmingly obvious and easy emotionality.

As if Freeman's explanatory voiceover wasn't enough, Darabont yells at us how we should feel about the movie and what we should think of each scene. The emotion of the scenes is thrown at us like slaps, in case we don't get it. The ambiguity, the understanding, the subtlety do not enter the universe of the director (in addition, the screenwriter of the film).

It's a film as correct as it is flat, with the aversion to risk, the standardized narrative style and the obvious tone of a television product.

The best are the performances: Freeman and Robbins. The worst, that shot-by-shot need to win over the public by giving it all away, to erase any edge of the story that might show the least ambivalence of the characters.

The educated upper-class banker is able, with tenacity, effort and intelligence, to create a habitable environment step by step in the harsh prison reality, with stupid jailers and teammates.

I have never understood the critical success of the film.",10
"Shawshank truly is the best-made standalone movie of all time.

As much as I might like the extended Lord of the Rings trilogy more overall, as for singularly movies, nothing tops Shawshank.",5
"This is one of those dramas that will keep on tied till the end. It showed the beauty of a griping screenplay. Some films will give a spark from the first glance itself. This is one movie that takes you deeper the more you watch it. a very thin story line with superb acting. But if you just want to watch a good movie with social message and how to not lose hope, then go for it",10
"One of the greatest films of all time. Frank Darabont, through his own screenplay of this Stephen King story, directs arguably the most powerful tale of hope and freedom in this masterpiece of a movie that should be watched by all. Andy Dufresne, charged guilty of the murders of his wife and her lover, is sent to Shawshank prison to serve back-to-back life sentences. This is the account of his legendary stay in the detention center as told by his friend, Ellis Redding. Packed with outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this is perhaps one of the most memorable films of the nineties, nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture which it ultimately lost to Forrest Gump. It is one of those films that leave you elated by the end, filled with happiness for its fictional characters that you eventually feel for. This will be the most satisfying two-and-a-half-hour film you'll probably ever sit right throughout. For a film that looks targeted to a male audience, it is one that transcends gender. Totally recommended.

I didn't have a single moment of boredom while watching this movie.When I think about this movie I wonder why.,5
"Well what can I say but, Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.",10
"First off, let me say that this was the real best picture of 1994. Forrest Gump was definitely a great film, Pulp Fiction was a film that set new standards in film genre, Quiz Show was great although a bit overrated, and I can't say much about Four Weddings And A Funeral. Despite the greatness of Pulp and Gump, neither of them matched up to the greatness of this film.

This film starts off with Tim Robbins going to prison over a crime he didn't even commit. The rest of the story unfolds as he befriends Morgan Freeman's character. The story is based upon the events during his stay in Shawshank.

When I said that this has everything you could ask for in a movie, I meant it. This movie has an engrossing story line, some great character development, awesome acting(you can never go wrong with Freeman), excellent score and editing, and an ending that will make you glad you watched the movie. The movie's place in IMDb's top 250 is well deserved, but the film not earning it's best picture Oscar is beyond me.",5
"In this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend.

I really like this movie, because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I loved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to.

I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.",7
"Despite its status as a classic, The Shawshank Redemption is not quite a great film, argues Robbie Collin.",10
"If perfection had to be defined through a movie, this would be it starting from the acting to direction to screenplay, everything, you name it and its here, done perfectly its almost as if God personally guided the people making this movie :)",9
"This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top 250, let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time. It is rather dull, extraordinarily predictable, and filled with clichés. This is not even the best prison film, let alone #2 among all films! Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone? I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not disappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible audience. Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition.",10
"Wonderful touching story that will make you cry AND feel extremely good inside. STEVEN KING proves that he is one of the best story writers EVER.

Superb acting by Freeman et al. Wonderful narrative, music, cinematorgraphy and backward looking story that escalates throughout the film.

A work of genious, J",10
"all I can say about this is that it is by a clear mile one of the best films ever made! the story line was gripping and intriguing, there was never a single dull moment and i can honestly say that this film is definitely one that i can watch over and over again without being bored. the cast really brought the characters to life and it was just such an emotional roller-coaster. if you have never seen this film before then i definitely recommend that you watch it! watch it on your own or with friends and family it really doesn't matter because i can guarantee that everyone will love it and if they for some reason don't then they clearly have no taste",9
"There is nothing to criticize about this movie. It is made as subtle and touching a movie can be. It never goes into emotions more than necessary. The music, the story, the acting, everything is perfectly orchestrated. It is delicate and beautiful in all the sense of the term. It is such a shame that Morgan Freeman didn't got an award, it would have been well deserved. Stephen King wrote again a masterpiece, like the Green Mile, from the same author and the same film director. Frank Darabont execute this story more in a tone that reminds me ""Out of Africa"". The prison is a character by itself, all the actors including the secondary roles are just perfect. Watching this movie remains us the true meaning of hope, and that everything is possible.

But what are you doing here? Rather than reading reviews, just buy it, rent it and see it. It is one kind of a unique movie that you will never forget.",2
Without question this is my all time favorite movie. Flawless!,10
"Okay so many people may be wondering why I hate such a ""beautiful work of literature"" or ""The best story ever told on screen"". Well there are too many reasons to list in my maximum of 1,000 words. So instead I will give a few obvious reasons on why I truly hate this movie. Being a teenager I enjoy movies like ""Mystic River"" and ""Donnie Darko"". You know psychological thrillers. Well this is nothing of the sort. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is what I classify as a Sleeping movie. The name says it all. You sleep while you watch it. It took me about a month to get through the whole entire movie. That is very sad considering the praise this movie received. I pray no one else ever has to go through the torture of watching this horrid movie.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie that should be seen by everyone at least once in their life. I am not one for re-watching movies or rereading books, but this movie is one of the few exceptions. I can recite more than half of the lines and it makes my day anytime that I see it is on (shout out to AMC for literally running marathons of it). It has a fulfilling plot that develops well and a great cast all around. To this day, it amazes me that it was not a box office hit.

It's a movie that will make you laugh and cry, a movie that will break your heart one moment and the next you'll be pumping your fist in satisfaction. This is certainly a 10/10 in my books. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"".",5
This movie is a life changer. It can change the way of how you perceive the life one lives in this world. It really is a movie which helps you for redemption. It always provides motivation and hope no matter how many time i watch it. It really deserves it's first place in imdb.,10
"Few movies allow you to feel as though youve been put on a riverboat in the middle of july as the suns going down, where you can see just how good you've really got life on the land.

Loved this mivue must see. This is a very interesting movie and a must see. Action packed and popcorn and chill.,9
Indeed... This is the best movie in history. An outclass script. And beautiful narration.,10
"Too sentimental, too pathetic, too slow, too conventionally made, and the voice over explaining everything ruins it completely, making it boring as hell. By far the most overrated film of all times.",10
"Every single scene in The Shawshank Redemption, every bit of dialogue, everything that happens all beautifully serves the purpose of intensifying the impact of the story itself. The muted colors and the relaxed cinematography do a spectacular job of taking us back in time, and the message of the film is inspiring, to say the least.

What you have in the Shawshank Redemption is a film that is extremely well thought-out and put together in such a way that it is able to hold your attention even for well over two hours. The movie is about holding on to hope in even the worst circumstances, even under tremendous stress, and even when you are in that situation unjustly. However, even though Andy Dufresne is clearly the protagonist, Red is actually a more important person as far as the message of the film. He seems to embody the lessons learned in the film, and this is shown in the way that his life is transformed by his friendship with Andy.

However, there were a few things about this film that I didn't like that I think took a lot away from it. For example, even though I admit that it didn't reduce the potency of the film itself, everything worked out a little too perfectly for Andy in prison. Sure, he got beaten up and sexually assaulted, but look at the aftermath of those attacks. When the ""Sisters"" beat him within an inch of his life, did he get his nose broken? Was he left with any scars? Were any of his limbs casted? Did he even develop a limp? No, what happened was he spent a month in the infirmary and got out with his hair messed up. That's a pretty small price to pay for almost being beaten to death.

I also find it hard to believe that every single guard in the prison, including the warden, would allow a prisoner to do their taxes. Sure, he's got expertise in the banking field, but he's also been convicted of murder. I would think that the warden in particular, with all of his, ahem, activities, would want to kind of keep to himself as far as his finances. Another problem was the timeline. We see events that take place over long periods of time, but we are largely left to speculate about what goes on in the years that are skipped over. The film comes together as a great story, but you have to keep in mind that in between scenes that seem to run together, YEARS have gone by. The aging process wasn't done very well either. All of the characters involved looked almost exactly the same at the beginning of the movie as they did at the end. When that many years have passed, something needs to be done to try to make the actors look at least a little bit older.

Aside from these minor deficiencies, as well as a confusing title, The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely incredible film. The setbacks can be overlooked because of the fact that the film as a whole communicates such an important and powerful message, and the film is not boring even for a second. It's intense, it's beautifully made, and it will not soon be forgotten.",10
Well directed & written. Each character is well played!,10
"The first time I saw the movie I was crazy about it .I did not want to speak to anyone nor do anything .I wanted to rise my arms and cry ---yes, just like what Andy did .It really inspires me greatly .

I believe it is a terrific film because it includes all things a film should have. The plot , the characters,the director,the spirits are all top.So I want to see it for another time .

Then I find out that I don't like the oaks which stands for power and strength .Why can't the letter just between two brisks. It's obvious the director wanna tell us something in a obvious way. But it's not serious,this is quite personal. I still know what I can get from this movie. The more I see it ,the more I get .

I know Andy deserves the happy ending ,will he succeed in the real world?",10
"Proof, along with _Delores Claiborne_ and _Stand by Me_ that Stephen King can spin a fine tale when he sets his mind to it. Even having read the book (this is one case where the movie is better), Robbins and Freeman's performances were so captivating that the ending still took me by surprise. Definitely one of the best.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption will go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time, If not the greatest movie ever.

The films draws you in for the very first second and keeps your eyes glued to the screen until the very last second! Excellently written and the acting was a class above the rest!! Highly recommend",10
"If someone tells me to describe a real, entertaining movie - that would be it. 'Real' for the lack of SFX is a true bless when talking about ""The Shawshank Redemption"". I become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the SFX crew or the team responsible for the CGI effects. Film's purity emphasises the importance of the act. The actors are incredible; not a single minute could be considered a bad acting (well, at least I think so). 'Entertaining' for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. I am not a huge fan of Tim Robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. Mr. Freeman stays solid as usual in his act.",1
"The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen it... please do, otherwise you are missing something.",10
"It's not that the storyline is extremely complex or something which makes this film great. The characters and the acting is what makes this film extraoridinary. So this film is about a few fellas who are prisoners inside the prison. Their goal is to get free. The characters live on hope and that's why this film is so important, it's one of the best inspirational movies ever which shows that no matter how bad the situation is, you will still have always have hope. The ending of this film is pure work of art and beauty. Hell, the whole film is one of the best cinematic experiences ever.",9
"Often said to be one of the best films of all time, I can't help but agree. No matter how many times I watch this over, I feel like it never bores me and I am always captivated in a way that I've never felt with any other film before.

The Shawshank Redemption is a tale of hope, courage and betrayal, seen through the eyes of prison inmates 'Andy' played by Tim Robbins, and older convict 'Red', portrayed by Morgan Freeman in an Oscar nominated performance. The film is set over 19 years in Shawshank prison, and depicts the life of Andy Dufresne, a hotshot banker and his struggle with keeping his mind and his sanity, whilst serving time for a crime he didn't commit. As Andy has to put up with harassment, distress and affliction throughout the duration of his time at the prison, the film illustrates a tale of eternal hope. As time slowly passes in the prison, he's assisted by an older inmate by the name of 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), a black marketer who is 'known to locate certain things from time to time'. As the years pass by, Andy's friendship with Red grows and so do the hardships they have to overcome.

The film itself has touched me in many ways, it shows me just what people can do when they have a little faith and keep incessant hope no matter what. Obviously, Stephen King's greatest and most memorable big screen interpretation, one of which he is almost certainly proud of. The movie is a timeless classic that speaks to me and probably a lot of others on so many levels, providing a near perfect film with a great plot line and representing a storyline with an even better message.

Tim Robbins delivers an enthralling performance as the titular character, one that certainly stands out throughout the film whereas Morgan Freeman's interpretation of fellow convict Red is just as captivating, earning him recognition from the academy but not his fellow co-star Robbins, obviously yet another Oscar snub.

Overall, the Shawshank Redemption speaks out to its audience, as it shows a tale of perseverance and perpetual hope when in the midst of the struggles in life. The film itself is possibly my favourite of all time and manages to keep my attention on the 10th time of watching it. A must-see for anyone who has a good taste in films and is looking for a movie that will change their perspective on life and give them the hope to pull through in the darkest of times.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless cinematic masterpiece that has transcended its genre to become a profound meditation on the human spirit. This extraordinary film, directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, grips the audience from the very beginning and takes them on an emotional journey that both captivates and humbles.

Set within the bleak confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the story revolves around Andy Dufresne (played flawlessly by Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murder. As the film unfolds, it delves into the depths of human despair and explores themes of hope, friendship, redemption, and the indomitable power of the human will.

What makes The Shawshank Redemption truly remarkable is its ability to resonate with audiences on a profound level. It strips away societal facades and lays bare the raw emotions and vulnerabilities that lie within us all. Through its well-crafted characters and meticulous storytelling, the film invites us to reflect on our own lives, prompting us to question our actions, choices, and the pursuit of happiness.

At the heart of the film is the extraordinary friendship between Andy and Red (portrayed brilliantly by Morgan Freeman). Their bond forms an emotional core that not only drives the narrative but also serves as a testament to the inherent goodness that can be found in the most unlikely places. Their conversations, shared experiences, and unwavering loyalty in the face of adversity remind us of the transformative power of human connection.

The cinematography beautifully captures the contrasting elements of the prison environment, from its oppressive walls to the fleeting glimpses of hope and beauty that manage to penetrate the desolation. The film's somber color palette and hauntingly evocative score contribute to the overall atmospheric richness, further enhancing its emotional impact.

Moreover, The Shawshank Redemption skillfully weaves a narrative tapestry that presents thought-provoking social commentary. It explores themes of institutionalization, corruption, and the resilience required to survive in a dehumanizing environment. Yet, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles, the film reminds us that there is always room for redemption and personal growth.

In its entirety, The Shawshank Redemption is an awe-inspiring tale that strikes a delicate balance between despair and hope, darkness and light. It humbles us by shining a light on the fragility of our existence, while simultaneously uplifting us through the unwavering spirit of its characters. It encourages us to reflect on our own lives, urging us to appreciate the freedom and opportunities we often take for granted.

The Shawshank Redemption stands as a testament to the power of cinema to evoke profound emotions, challenge our perspectives, and inspire us to be better human beings. It is a masterpiece that will continue to captivate audiences for generations to come, reminding us that in the darkest of times, there is always a flicker of hope that can ignite our souls and set us free.",6
"In this movie Morgan Freeman has delivered his greatest performance in his legendary career. Awesome right? but that's not all.

Shawshank Redemption is without doubt the best movie of its decade and one of the best movies ever made. Killer plot, great directing, great cinematography, amazing acting and in the end you are left stunned, touched and you will fall in love with it. If you do not like this movie something is definitely wrong with you.

This movie not winning any Oscar is simply disgraceful.

In conclusion if you haven't watched this movie than you are missing a lot.",10
This is the definition of a what a Great movie supposed to be like!,5
"I cannot believe that this movie has rec'd the accolades it has. I thought was mediocre at best and at worst saccharin, predictable, neatly cathartic and only mildly believable. I think that if it didn't contain the rape scenes, it would have been so sweet that I would have turned it off before I regurgitated. This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't - but it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at instilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about male bounding. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone.",10
"This is an amazing movie. The acting is incredible and the screenplay and direction are amazing. Extremely powerful and pretty depressing, it actually has a pretty heartwarming kind of ending and the way everything ties together at the end is simply brilliant. You must see this movie, definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen.",9
"When I watched this movie for the first time I knew anything about the movie, but I had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, I saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor.",10

One of the best prison movie ever made. I can't imagine talking about movies without mentioning this film.,10
"Shawshank is supposed to be the greatest movie ever. It was alright to me.

I mean not much to say really. I've seen it too many times. I guess it's cool if it's your first time watching.

Not bad, worth watching

7 stars",10
"It's a lovely story with nice guys (you'd love to make friends with) and bad guys (you'd love to hate). OK. Let's say it's the kind of entertaining stuff that makes you feel good... provided you are lenient enough to find it deep, genuinely humane, etc.

So you think it's a wonderful movie? Welly welly well. Maybe I need to tell you something about cinema. [Don't take it as a lesson from an infatuated Frenchman but simply as the point of view of a cinema lover.] Cinema is about images made emotions. Hence astoundingly good movies are way above the usual recipe: (good story + good story-telling) + (good characters + good actors) = good movie.

As long as it was, never did I felt emotions through images in The Shawshank Redemption. The good characters/actors/story-telling... had already killed every single spark of emotion. Especially the deadpan voice-over narration.

Bottom line: Shawshank Redemption is beautifully bundled, not beautifully crafted. Guess why Tim Robbins directed Dead Man Walking the year after.",10
"Shawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time. To say that this is better than Lawrence of Arabia, better than Alien, Better then Saving Private Ryan, is just ridiculous. This movie is weak, as are all the characters in it. I'll never forgot the scene where the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano symphony kicks in. Why should I feel sorry for him? Try living in Africa buddy and tell me how hard your life is. This movie is for weak people who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak people. Now I love the director of this and Stephen King, but im sorry, this isn't a masterpiece, it's forcing the audience into the characters emotional problems that few can relate. Go see the Green Mile instead.

"I always heard that this movie was good, so I decided to check it out. And I gotta say, I was quite impressed. The tone, characterization, screenplay, etc. are all fantastic. Is it the best movie of all time? Tough call. But it is one of the few movies I can say is 10/10 stars.",10
"I saw this movie for the first time when it came on television earlier this month. After seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250, I thought this would be a good opportunity to check it out. The story was gripping and I especially liked the pacing, with the story moving along at a quick pace, covering years in a matter of minutes. The film was quite gritty and realistic throughout but started losing that quality as it started feeling more like a fairy tale towards the end.

Although the story was initially focused on Andy, it later became quite apparent that Red was the true protagonist, who Morgan Freeman portrayed in one of his best performances to date. I believe Morgan Freeman deserved an Oscar for his performance, although he lost it to Tom Hanks, who gave an equally great performance in Forrest Gump that same year.

Although I disagree with The Shawshank Redemption's ranking at #1 on the IMDb Top 250, I believe it is worthy enough to at least be among the top 100 films. If I had to sum up the film in one sentence, I would say it is a very gripping and uplifting film to watch.

8/10",10
Truly a masterpiece of cinema. This is definitely one of my favorite movies.,10
"This movie became my favorite movie of all time, before i had even seen the whole thing. Has this happened to anyone else? I had seen parts on TV and that was it. The day i finally rented it, i was practically jittery with excitement. This just tells you about my unique subjective experience with it. After it was over, I wasn't dissatisfied in the least. It is truly a great film all around. It is one of those things where part of me wants everyone in the world to see it, but another part of me feels like my personal experience with it makes it my own. I don't want to write an extensive review and put it under some kind of lens and analyze it. I'll just say that from that day forward, The Shawshank Redemption had profoundly affected the way I view movies and it his been the gateway into my current passion for films.",8
I don't know anyone who dislikes this film. It's an absolute classic every time you watch it 10/10!!,10
what an amazing and motivating movie never get bored at any part of it. the music is so amazing and have you in a great movie mode. the screenplay was perfect you can never be bored from it or feel that any part wasn't in its place. Morgan freeman as great as usual never get bored from him knows when to make you laugh and when to get shocked or excited. also Tim Robbins I can't forget him since I first watched his movie Nothing to Lose with Martin Lawrence and the great amount of laughing and sorry you feel with along the movie. this movie for me is one of the iconic movies over history which I have a good memories for it and loves it so much.,9
"The Shawshank Redemption has been the number 1 ranked movie on IMDB for some years. What does that tell you?

Maybe it's mainly male readership values an all men movie. Where the only woman of consequence cheated on her husband and got murdered!

A rising young banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has been jailed for life for killing his wife and her lover. When he enters Shawshank State Penitentiary. One of the prisoners Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) thinks that Andy will struggle to survive the first night.

Instead another new inmate wails like a baby and is brutally beaten up by guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown.) He later dies in the prison hospital, the other prisoners did not even catch his name.

The ever quiet Andy befriends Red asking him to procure a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth.

Andy realises that the Bible loving prison warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is a greedy hypocrite.

Over time, Andy comes into invaluable use to the warden and the guards because of his knowledge of the tax system. He files their tax returns and launders their money.

In return he is saved from the prison rapists. Andy becomes popular with the other inmates, most touching is his friendship with Red that endures for 20 years.

When I first watched The Shawshank Redemption, I regarded it as a well made prison movie. Poetical courtesy of Morgan Freeman's narration. Writer and director Frank Darabont had elevated Stephen King's source novella.

I revisited many years later, in case I did the movie an injustice. I can why the movie is held in high regard. It has good performances from Robbins and Freeman, although Robbins is a bit too subdued.

Maybe that is because events show that Andy was always a man with an escape plan the moment he stepped inside the prison.

The movie also has something to say about prison culture. Many of these men have become institutionalised. It makes barbed observations about the parle board and how cheap prison labour affects the local economy.

Is it the greatest film of all time? Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Gone with the Wind suggests that it is a no.

It is not even the best movie from 1994 not to win the Best Picture Oscar. That accolade goes to Pulp Fiction.",10
The best movie I saw everrrrrrrrrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrr rrrrrrr rrrrrrrr rrrrrr,10
Awesome movie.it was one of the best movie I ever seen.,10
"This is THE greatest movie of all time, bar none. It should be #1, I don't care if you love Star Wars or if you love The Godfather. I don't like them, don't get me wrong, they maybe great movies in somebody else's eye, but how the whole world cannot relate to the Shawshank Redemption is incredible.

It just shows the difference between some people. I am probably being a bit shallow here, but I believe all the evil, racist and bad people have not seen the Shawshank Redemption, and if they have seen, haven't really understood it. They're too narrow minded. If you understand this movie, it will change your life, make no mistake about it.

After I saw this, I just knew...you in life, there are some things you just KNOW, with gut instinct...eg, when your in love or something? I just knew, no matter how old I got, how mature I became...I would never see anything like this. I am only 19 and god knows how many movies I may see in the future, if I live long enough but I can honestly say, I will not ever see anything better.

This just sums life up. If I don't watch this like every now and again, my life seems incomplete. If I don't visit the IMDb page I feel incomplete. If I don't participate with the fellow Shawshankers on IMDb...I feel INCOMPLETE.

This brings happiness to my soul deep inside. Brings a smile to my face. People can say what they want about clichés, and cheesy moments but I don't care. This movie stirs the soul and if somebody can actually HATE something like this...then your not human.

This movie shows....in every circumstance, that GOOD always prevails over evil. I don't want to spoil it for those of you who haven't seen it, but Redemption is a great thing.

We have all been through pain in our lives, and if you haven't...you will. This movie gives you tremendous hope. You will get far in life, if you stick by that word...HOPE.

""When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high. At the end of the storm there's a golden sky.

Walk on through the wind. Walk on through the rain. Though your dreams be tossed & blown. Walk on, Walk on. With 'HOPE' in your heart...and you'll NEVER walk alone"" No matter what you've been through, you can get through it and become a stronger person. You can literally have feces all over you but you will STILL be clean. Watch it and you will know what i'm talking about.

If you haven't seen this, then you don't and will never understand life truly.

Just watch it, and watch out for the memorable acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

They don't make movies like this anymore......",6
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances worthy of cinematic heaven. No where do we spot the intention of their performances, only the gradual development of a friendship that transcends race, age, and social class.

The line between guilty and innocent, although blurred amongst the inmates, is animated by the corrupt guards, and the abysmal treatment of men who have sand piles on their weary shoulders.

Redemption is the predominate theme, as well as perseverance and friendship through situation. Biblical undertones pervade: Robbins bears oppression that angers the viewers until the redemptive secret is revealed.

The institution, the jail, as metaphor for society often succeeds. The ""instituional man"" cannot survive beyond the social structure behind the walls. He is a lost soul without the community of thieves and murderers that defines his existence. What is a man, but a success amongst his peers? One of the best films of the twentieth century.",10
"Directing, script is awesome, acting perfect. Film rocks forever",10
"Shawshank Redemption deserves to be ranked among the elite films of the past. Some complain that this will never be a classic and should not be ranked with the Godfather, Schindler's List, Pulp Fiction...etc...Well guess what...This masterpiece of a film is rare breed. Sooner or later, a film deserving elite status WILL be produced,and there will be others in the future. You complainers would have said the same idiotic thing back in the early 70's, when The Godfather was released.

Shawshank is a tremendous piece of work that forever will be thought as one of the elites ever produced in the history of film and cinema.

Shawshank deserves to be #1 and I hope it retains that position. Someday another elite film will be released and may overtake Shawshank and then the complainers will be out in full force once again! Can't please everyone can we, typical stupidity once again.

Thanks for such a wonderful piece of art and film....It's one DVD I will always keep in my library for many, many years to come! Shawshank Redemption is not the best film of the 1990's, it's one of the BEST films of all time! Ranked right up there with other elite films of similar caliber!",9
"Although it does represent prison life in the 1940s and Robbins does a great job , this movie failed to entertain me. The movie is very well done, but the ending is silly and predictable. I don't understand the hype .",7
"Great film. If you like this, you'll love Virgins of Sherwood Forrest",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite movie of all time. It has every single element that should be looked for in a film. A brilliant script (with the best dialogue ever written), a perfect cast (not one bad performance), and not to mention an original, complex and ultimately uplifting story.

Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial intercut with his actions on the night of his crime. This leads to him being taken to Shawshank with one of the best shots ever captured on film, with the camera sweeping from behind the prison bus in the air and diving into the middle of the prison yard. There Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and others, and a gradual friendship begins to develop.

This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character.

The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.

There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. He is a director of the future. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.

I encourage everyone who has not seen this to grab it now, as it is surely not only the best movie of the 90's but the best movie of all time.

***** out of *****",10
"What is this movie is doing in the top ten? Its a good movie. By good I mean - you go to see it and you walk out saying - that was a good movie. Then you may watch it again because you remember enjoying it the first time. On the third viewing you are beginning to tire of it and the characters seem more contrived and you begin to see how the script has some flaws. Still - all and all - its better than most. A great movie (and there are many) is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you marvel at the script - the performances - the music - all the things we love about the movies. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't come close. Well made, good performances, but not great and not deserving of being on ANY top ten movie list of all time.",10
"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs

In 1947,banking boss Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover and given two life sentences in the notorious Shawshank State Prison.Keeping himself to himself and giving off a slightly aloof vibe,Andy finds it hard to settle in at first,but then he develops a friendship with prison fixer Red (Morgan Freeman) which comes to stand the test of time between life within the confines of Shawshank...and even outside it.

Stephen King adaptations are things that generally seem to have trouble even becoming watchable things on the big screen,let alone spell-bindingly brilliant pieces of work.So,it is credit to director Frank Darabont,who would later go on to helm another SK adaptation,the only slightly inferior Green Mile,that he has managed to do just that.

Of all the Stephen King books and short stories that I've read,I've never actually come across Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,yet I was still able to appreciate this films on all the levels it deserves to be appreciated on.

Everything just comes together and works like magic.On the performances front,as the narrator and co-star,Freeman adds solid,engaging and memorable support,but it has to be said he's been in better roles and,for all he's worth,he's outshone in the leading role by Robbins,who rightfully earned the Oscar nomination,and was only cheated in not getting it.He delivers a powerful,intensely focused portrayal of a man who appears in complete acceptance of all the events that have transpired around him and is fighting his own personal demons to adapt to the changes that are happening all around him.I don't think I can remember him delivering a more entertaining performance in any other film I've seen him in.Other great support comes from Bob Gunton as the bible-preaching yet corrupt warden and Clancy Brown as his sadistic right hand man/guard,but,in fairness to them all,they all take a back seat to Robbins.

Despite it's grim themes,the film somehow also manages to be a beautiful one of hope.""Get busy living...or get busy dying"" says Andy,high-lighting how from the direst of situations,what one makes of it can ultimately deaden despair and bring...well,hope.The topic of how incarceration can bring about institutionalization is also brought up,and how,for those serving life sentences,the ultimate punishment,having spent most of their life in jail,is to be freed at all,to a world that will have passed them by and an age they will struggle to come to terms with.""When they send you to Shawshank State Prison,that's exactly what they take...your life"",another line from the film that captures perfectly what it's trying to say.

Some would appear detracted that the film has a presentation that is more fitting to a TV movie than a major Hollywood production.But considering it could be put in the same league as all the effects-reliant blockbusters,the further the film could do to distance itself from those kinds of film,in my opinion,the better.

In it's tenth anniversary year,this is a film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Considering all the rubbish that gets released nowadays,it's good and refreshing to know that as comparatively recently as ten years ago,it was still possible to see quality stuff like this emerge out the woodwork every so often.I consider it to be one of the greatest films ever made (thoroughly deserving of it's position at No.3 on the IMDb Top 100 list!) and easily on a par only with Stand By Me as the greatest King novel to make it to the big screen.It truly is a film of majestic quality and brilliance.*****",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a good movie with great actors, a decent director, wonderful music and a very obvious plot. I think the movie would have been between mediocre and failure were it not for Robbins and Freedman.

Its ranking on the IMDb top 250 is a shame. It shouldn't be on a list with other such high caliber films as the Godfather and Gone With the Wind. I think that the re-release of the DVD is the cause of its illogical high-standing.

Don't get me wrong. Its a good movie its just not as good as people say. Worth watching especially if your a fan of either of the main actors.

"""Salvation lies within."" -Warden Norton to Andy.

I do not believe there is such a thing as a perfect movie. However, this, it is a masterpiece.

I was not even alive when this movie was released. I didn't know of it until maybe four years ago. Since then, I have seen this movie multiple times and honestly, I don't get tired of it. This is among the most powerful stories ever told in a film. Ever. This movie is simply about friendship. The friendship that takes form over roughly 20 years in a Maine prison. One man, is in prison for murder. He is guilty. However, his friend, is not guilty. An innocent man is placed in prison for two life sentences for a crime he did not commit.

Red (played masterfully by Morgan Freeman)is the guilty man, while Andy Dufresne (played wonderfully by Tim Robbins) is the innocent man.

The two of them show remarkable chemistry. They pull this off simply by talking to each other throughout the movie. Usually when I see a trailer for a movie today, there's explosions, or a natural disaster or gang wars or something. This movie consists almost 99.9999999% simple talking. And its done to perfection.

With a well done script, terrific acting, and a very good ending, this movie will forever be among the greatest ever.

There are countless moments in this movie where you feel moved, inspired, or you feel that you've learned something.

I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone. A true masterpiece.",6
"i remember watching this years ago, i loved the setting of the scenes and to me it was pretty good acting. and if anyone is to go see a good movie, i highly recommend this one, with some people it may not be their cup of tea, but, if you want a good kickback with some popcorn and prop your feet up, and take the phone off the hook, and DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR, DESPITE THE NEIGHBORS WANTING A OCCASIONAL CUP OF SUGAR, than yes, this is good movie to sit back and enjoy.",9
It is really a nice movie I have seen. In beginning it seems some boring but after one hour it change the atmosphere. It is well planned and seen are thriller. I never seen such a beautiful movie. The role which actor has played is memorable and very energetic. I recommend to see it all the movie likers. Must watch movie.,10

"In my opinion, it deserves to be in AFI's top 10 of all time. Just one of those extremely rare movie experiences. The highest compliment I can pay it is that every movie I have watched since Shawshank has paled in comparison. I've never been so involved in a movie from beginning to end. And the ending is so incredible it provides inner joy you can't even express. Gump was very good and won Oscars because of the hype and $$$ it spent & collected. But, Shawshank with no special effects or high priced productions provided better script, plot development, acting and ending than 99.9% of Hollywood films before and probably after it. Totally under-appreciated masterpiece..",10

"Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so. It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination. I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama. Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this.",7
"This film is a masterpiece. It manages to wrench the viewer through every emotion possible. With Morgan Freeman's ardent narration and Tim Robbins' masterful expressions, Director Frank Darabont has taken a short description by Stephen King and crafted it into something that deserves to be seen by everyone.",10
"This movie was inspired by the brilliant Stir Crazy starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. As an essay on prison life, Shawshank Redemption fails on every level that Stir Crazy managed to succeed on.

Shawshank is nowhere near as funny as Stir Crazy. There is not a woodpecker suited bank robbery to be found. There is no Grossberger, no homosexual black man hassling the heroes, no silly mania scenes. There is nothing here that even remotely comes close to emulating its predecessor.

The obvious links to the original are still there: Morgan Freeman in the Richard Pryor role and Tim Robbins as Gene Wilder. However, Robbins and Freeman are nowhere near Wilder and Pryor in the acting stakes and we end up feeling disappointed at their lack of conviction (no pun intended) in the roles.",6
The problem with this movie is that it is to ordinary. It seems like the movie is just a cheap feelgood flick that has an ending that is easily predicted. I didn't care much for the characters and the narration was pretty annoying. I've read the book and it's a good adaptation. See it if your a Stephen King fan or like Dramas.,6
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) bides his time during twenty years' imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story. And being Stephen King, the setting is once again Maine, though you'll find 'Shawshank State Prison' in Ohio. It's the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory, 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, on US Route 30, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland.

Built between 1886 and 1910, the reformatory remained in operation until 1990 and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made. In fact, much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution, but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction. Find it just north of downtown Mansfield, off South Olivesburg Road.",10
"Thought to be one of the greatest movies of all time and ranked 2nd on IMDb's list of top 250 movies ever created. When i first heard of this film and its general plot i wasn't too enthusiastic about watching it. I mean, lets get serious... yet another prison movie where someone is supposedly wrongly accused for a crime he did not commit... we've seen them all. However, i can honestly and proudly admit that i was beyond the shadow of a doubt, completely and utterly wrong. This is truly an amazing movie. With its own charisma to it, it leaves the audience on the edge of their seats, wanting to find out more and waiting for the plot to unravel further. It captures your mind and truly speaks to you. Of course, a great deal of respect must be given to Morgan Freeman and Tim Robin for their outstanding performances. This movie deserves to have its own genre. A MUST see movie and a personal favorite.",8
"This movie is a must see! It's warm, clever, heartfelt and a tearjerker. You will be sucked in immediately. It's one of those rare movies that takes you along for the ride and makes you feel like you're apart of the journey. You wind up so interested that you can watch the entire movie in silence and not want to turn off the television or even press pause. As the movie progresses, it feels like you are getting to know the characters and that they are real and their stories, backgrounds as well as their lives sync perfectly as the movie goes along only to conclude harmoniously as the cherry-on-top. Make some popcorn and enjoy because you won't want to get out of your seat once you press play!",10
"I felt very emotional with the story during my teenage. When I rewatched in my 20s, I understood the brilliant script and storytelling of the movie.

The title of the film is the on criticism you could make of this masterpiece. If you talk to any group of people about ""what's the best film ever made"" you're almost guaranteed that someone in the group will mention this film.

The script is superb and both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do make it a moving story of friendship, dignity, and most importantly hope. It's one of those films where you feel obliged to recommend it to everyone you know. Theirs something so special about this film and you shouldn't be allowed to talk about films if you've missed this gem.",10
"Shawshank Redemption, based on a short story by Stephen King, is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film, clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has.

He makes friends with people in jail, and goes through his daily life. Hope is all he can hold on to, count on, and rely on. Through years he figures a way to end all of it. The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. They hated the walls of the jail. They've grown used to them. And they love them. But not Andy.

Everything about this movie is amazing. Screenplay, cinematography,acting, production... its simply one of the best films off all time.",10
"I've seen this film a few times now but its only recently that i can really appreciate it for what it is, a truly remarkable story. As I've grown up since the first time I've seen it, i could only remember the main storyline and barley its characters and previously just thrown the name of this film around in social circles to sound like i knew what i was talking about. I find this story, the greatest story ever told through the medium of film (although originally a novel) purely on its merit and its inspirational tone towards life in general.

I sit here choking on my words because none of them seem adequate enough to describe how highly i think of this film and how much of a heart warming glow i received after I recently sat down and really digested its story. It is in my opinion one of the the best pictures ever.

I think it appeals to a lot of people. Its a story of friendship and hope. Im sorry its THE story of friendship and hope no other can portray the meanings of each better and i personally was amazed when i found out there was no Oscar's to its credit.

this film will always transcend decades and times as a great story",10

I could write for hours about the masterful direction, the acting which challenged perfection, the incredible writing, etc., but I wanted to point something out that others seemed to have missed. This film boasts the best music I have ever heard in a film. Whoever wrote the music deserves the credit of being the man, in my opinion, who made this film what it is. I'm actually studying music as my major in college, with film as my minor. So I just wanted to tell everyone to notice the music next time you watch this film, and you will have a much more enjoyable experience. Every person who contributed to this film is brilliant and I worship everyone who had anything to do with this film.",7
"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so Hollywood cliche ! How can this be in the top 2 best movies ever ? I don't understand it. Avoid at all cost, this movie is boring !",10
"I look at many of the contenders that would be the most marvellous movies ever made and can only be more reassured of this film's true status as the absolute pinnacle of what Hollywood has tried to portray over the past century. This film (as many greats), was originally ignored by critics even shunned.

So we should ask what actually makes a good film..., what makes the perfect movie???? Well, the answer in three words is .... 'The Shawshank Redemption'. This film was originally put down because it was not the best filmed or best acted etc., but overall it is better than 'ANYTHING' ever before and the benchmark for all that followed. I can't imagine a movie lover who would dismiss any notion that his or her life was made slightly better by this film (YES REALLY IT IS THAT GOOD).

The Godfather films even The lord of the rings are enormous cinematic triumphs, but for me the measure of a film is in how it tells a story, and how it leaves you feeling at the end. I can't imagine any narcotic that could rouse you in the same way as this would should you be viewing for the first time.

A simple story of a middle class young man, imprisoned for killing his wife in an unforgiving fortress, left with nothing but his intelligence and his strength of heart. Through his relationships with his inmates, and his ability to survive we walk every step with Andy until we finally witness the genius of ..... ""The Shawshank Redemption"" If you haven't seen this you are so unbelievably lucky to be able to experience it for the first time.

The best and most 'need to see' film ever made.

"In every way, this film is an affirmation of faith; not simply religious faith, but faith of any kind. In no other way has a film of such simple storytelling been so well received nor powerful. At the same time, there is a measure of realism here not seen many other highly-praised movies.

The Godfather, The Return of the King, The Seven Samurai; all incredible movies, but the one flaw residing over all three is this: In very little ways are the protagonists in these true-to-life. A Mafia Don, a would-be King, warriors of old - they are larger than life; they have a quality to them that raises them above all others - and the films, thus, retain a quality in the realm of the fantastic that sully the realism they wish to portray.

The Shawshank Redemption is not in the like. Not one of the characters could be called ""larger than life;"" in no way are any of the characters ""good"" or ""evil"" - the boundary is so grayed that it no longer exists; they're simply human, with sins, hopes, loves, and fears. In a way no other film has ever been able to, Shawshank perfectly reflects a story of humanity and hope. It comes to be that we do not begin to see these people as characters, but begin to think as they do, to become them.

If you really want to see a film of limitless power and beauty, a film that you truly become delved into, with characters that you feel perfect sympathy and empathy towards, The Shawshank Redemption is it.",5
"The movie is well built and has a few exceptional moments. But it is fully (or as much as possible) understandable only in a certain key. And that key is religious, or rather spiritual. It belongs to a certain view over the world, and makes me consider how much some people believe that is the only correct view. I think it is called gnosticism. In its light the movie depicts life itself, transdimensional that is. The human existence on Earth is a punishment, a form of demotion for the spirits that inhabit the human bodies, and the ""angels"" are here to protect the rules by which these punished spirits in human bodies have to live. There is not much kindness or fairness in this existence, unless some individual way of transcending it cuts through the harsh rules. Aside this rather severe framework of things, the story may be captivating, perhaps more for down to earth people than for dreamers. It is a milestone movie, so better watch it for a personal opinion. My take on it however, is that if one disagrees with its ""key"", it may just fall apart a bit, or if one does not consider the key, the movie feeds a sum of concepts that really should declare themselves as such, to allow awareness when coming into contact with them.",10
"Soooo amazing movie the screen plan, actors, director are awsome so successfull thanks for all workers on backstage you had a very splendid movie congratssss.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a film which follows the events of Andy Dufresne while he has to live, or more like, survive, at Shawshank Prison.

This film has it all. The scenes, the camera angles, the actors, the dialogue, story... It's all tied in in a way that few films do. The movie continues its narrative perfectly, and the actors do an amazing job at portraying the characters.

I don't want to do a review with spoilers, but I'll tell you, if you're having doubts on watching this movie, don't.",9

Great!! good movie.......................................,10
This movie deserves to be the best.. No movie made till the date has beaten it,10
"The Cost of Bondage tells the stories of the world that two prisoners, Andy and Red, set up behind bars. Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker. He is tried for the murder of his wife and his lover and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Shawsank Prison beatings, torture, rape, all kinds of situations are happening, but Andy is committed to life and optimistic. This attitude shows the people around him. When Andy opens his hopeful perspective, he convinces all prisoners that your bars are a bile-free life. Andy will also have a friend who will partner with these bubbles: Red. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, an adaptation of Stephen King, starring the film. In 1995, the film was nominated for seven Oscar nominations, including the best film nomination",10
"An amazing tale to explain such a simple message. Be patient, work hard, work smart and what was looking impossible will make it possible by itself.",10
A masterpiece. No other words has to be said. A pure original masterpiece.,10
Where do I begin. This movie has everything. An exciting and interesting plot. Even more interesting characters. An amazing story from beginning to end. One that anyone can recognize and enjoy. I watch this movie once a year during the Christmas holidays and every year it gets better. I can state without shadow of doubt that Shawshank redemption is my all time favorite movie. I might add also that I consider it the greatest movie ever made.,10
"I feel sorry for all of you , guys/girls who rated this as 1 star (awful). I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen.

Maybe it is overrated, maybe not , but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top 250. This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if you loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give it a 5.

I read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying : "" ... it is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star because I think it is very overrated ... "" That's so pathetic ...

The greatest movie never to have won an academy award - no doubt. The greatest movie of all time - possibly

If you have never seen this movie you are lucky, because i will never again be able to see it for the first time.A truly heart-warming and inspiring piece of cinema. Awesome",10

"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ****

A man sets out to scratch together some semblance of a life after he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. With the inmates taking bets on which one of the new prisoners will fall victim to the harsh environment, the movie evolves into a blossoming friendship between the convicted murderer and the prison handyman. With a growing trust and bond that will stand forever they begin to share in their experiences and over time the new prisoner becomes much more than just a friend; he becomes a man with vision and determination whilst also using the system to his benefit by applying his professional experience within the prison.

The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece portraying the issues that we expect a movie of this calibre to portray, whilst also developing sub-plots with such precision that the entire movie felt like it passed in double quick time. Rarely do I get the feeling that a movie was totally seamless, but this was one instance. The acting was first rate, with both Robbins and Freeman putting in the performances of a lifetime. I must admit I haven't see much of Robbins' work, but if all his other performances slump to deep mediocrity he will still be remembered for his part here. Freeman was superb as the inmate who has come to terms with Shawshank, believing that hope springs futility and that Shawshank becomes an institutionalised aspect of a mans' character, whether inside or out.

To focus on just two people would be ludicrous, there are a number of other outstanding contributions from the prison rule makers and the band of men that keep morale high enough to contemplate living on through their sentences. The movie triggered a number of responses personally, the obvious responses of sadness and happiness can be taken for granted. But emerging through the obvious were issues of friendship, trust, betrayal, hatred, anger and injustice. So too was there joy and relief, and a new perspective on what life and prison means to many people that I previously hadn't thought of.

Personally, one of the saddest moments I can remember from all of the movies I have seen involves an old book-keeper who has to come to terms with freedom. For those that have seen it you'll probably concur that it was deeply touching; for those who haven't seen the movie you may see a fresh insight into prison life. It is a wonderfully crafted film, and whilst I hate banding extreme and blind accolades at movies that can be taken as fads, this will probably stay in my top five favourite movies for it's enjoyment, its direction and it's comprehensive grasp of so many of it's focus points. An outstanding movie.",1
"This movie is flawless in my opinion. Every situation and character are so intricately woven, there is no wasted celluloid here. Every aspect of the movie, from acting, directing, and all factors that make up a masterpiece are in top form. It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way. If you are feeling down, give it a watch and it's hard not to be inspired. I find more meaning with each viewing. It's one of the few movies that I've not grown tired of watching again and again. Once again, in my opinion, it's one of the best!",9
"The first time I saw this movie I loved it. But I loved it more and more every time I saw it again. If you want to have a good and entertaining time watching a movie, buy this movie.",10
"A wonderful film, truly one of the best ever made and deserving of its place among the top films. There may be problems but the clever story line and brilliant actors will distract you from that. Tim Robbins has a good role as Andy Dufresne, the banker convicted for the murder of his wife and her Lover. Morgan Freeman has an absolutely brilliant role with his portrayal of Red, the experienced prison Fixer, in an example of excellent casting. The film shows the corruption within the prison system and has excellent characterisation. The idea of leaving prison is questioned throughout the film, as the characters wonder how beneficial leaving prison will really be. The film is certainly quite violent but the storyline more then makes up for this. The ending is delightful to watch but I won't spoil it. You should watch the film yourself.",10
"i'm sorry for watching this great film by a pirate video cd, that's the only way i can approach movies like this, because i live in china. in this place, you can only see a hollywood movie like ""true lie"" those having radical actions in it. i watched this movie when all my family were sleeping, for none of them likes this movie, they have no patience to continue watching movie like this with no action. and i really touched, in some extents living in china is somewhat like living in shawshank, you need hope and endurance to keep on, i got a lot from this movie, thanks to the director to tim robbins and morgan freeman,and the vendor who recommend the video cd to me.",10
One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass. The movie could have continued this story for another 2 or 3 hours and I don't think it would have lost my interest. I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the 'movie critics'. The best movie ever??? Definitely. Everything else pales in comparison.,10
"From the outside, the Shawshank State Prison looks like an English country home, with turreted corners and a wide open surrounding lawn. It's only when you get inside and see the walls and meet the brutal guards that you start to realize that the state government simply wants you out of sight and out of mind. And that if you die in Shawshank, the only reason that might interest the government or the public is that it will save them money.

The two main protagonists are Andy Durfresne (played by Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman). Andy is the new prisoner, a banker and investment expert convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Red is the experienced con, who makes do on the inside by smuggling cigarettes, whiskey, tooth brushes, movie posters, etc. into the prison, and facilitating a market between the prisoners and between the prisoners and the guards.

Two other important characters are prison Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and the Captain Hadley (wonderfully played by Clancy Brown). Andy, obviously, isn't your usual prisoner. For one thing, he doesn't look very tough, certainly not tough enough to have killed anyone. Red bets that Andy will be the first of the new draft of prisoners to ""break"" during their first night locked in cells, by crying. And ""The Sisters,"" prisoners who delight in raping other prisoners, target Andy from day one.

Well, both Red and ""The Sisters"" are wrong. Andy doesn't say a bad word about his confinement or his cell. And ""The Sisters"" have to beat the Hell out of Andy time after time to get any enjoyment out of him. (Another feature of prison life which Andy doesn't complain about.) What Andy does, is try to get on living. He has this hobby of rock carving, for which Red can supply the necessary tools and rocks. He is also good at doing things like filling out tax forms and giving investment advice. This skill comes to the attention of the Warden and the guards, especially Hadley. Soon, although not soon enough, Andy is given a trivial job in the prison library and protection from The Sisters in turn for providing investment advice to the guards and, for laundering all the money the Warden is making off the free labor he controls.

Andy does other things to. Over time he manages to turn the dark, basement library at the prison into a real library where other convicts can simply read or, with ambition, try for their high school credentials. In other words, Andy, although a convicted murder is good for the people around him, even a bunch of convicts doing hard time.

Is this the way prisons really operate? Can one person make the difference? Well, probably not. In fact I suspect Shawshank is shown to be a nicer place to live than any real state prison is, but the level of gross brutality displayed in the movie by both the guards and by some of the prisoners was all I wanted to see and enough to convince me that I wouldn't want to live there. Also, this is a movie about redemption, a rare enough event in ordinary life to motivate some ""suspension of disbelief.""

There's the other side of redemption too, which is punishment of the truly guilty. The Shawshank Redemption supplies both. And has fun doing so. In fact, when I saw most of the movie by accident on TV, I - who never watches TV - found myself yelling at the kids to be quite so I could follow everything that went on. And then I went out the next day and rented the video both to enjoy watching it again, and to help answer some left over questions, like ""who really did get redemption?""

I strongly encourage you to see the movie to find out the answer to that, and several other questions.",10
"This film is amazing! It holds such emotional power. There is such meaning in it, and it is all captured beautifully in this movie. The fact that hope does in fact still exist! Tim Robbins, and Morgan Freeman are an amazing team in it. I loved it! Its one every movie lover, or just anyone should see!",10
"The storyline, the links, the twists, everything about this movie made me want to watch it all over again. It is the best movie I've seen by far. I recommend it 100%.",10
"I don't disagree with the vast majority of folks that have seen this movie and found it to be excellent. But instead of chiming in with more rave comments, I'll mention the one thing I thought could have made it a better film.

I think the director had a choice as to how to portray the two chief villains, the warden and the head prison guard. He could have modeled them after well known American villainous types, or he could have used a Nazi type model. He seemed to have chosen the later which I felt was unfortunate. Maybe some would disagree, but I perceived them both as Nazis as I watched the film. The Warden's steely intellectual manner reminded me more of a sadistic Nazi doctor than a bible thumping Christian. And the prison guard was very teutonic looking and handsome rather than looking like the brutish American stereotype that I would have preferred. I guess its a minor point, but given the rave reviews this movie has gotten, I felt it deserved mention. I would have been able to identify with the banker's suffering even more with more believable, American villains rather than ones that seemed calculated to evoke memories of WWII prisoner of war camps.",10
"This is the best movie of all time. It has a great cast in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. This is the greatest movie based of a book I have ever seen. Every character filled every role to the best they could and they all did great. When you first watch this movie you think the story is about Tim Robbins character but when you watch it a second time you actually see that its a story about Morgan Freeman. I love this movie and always will. Watch this movie its the best there ever was. Also Tim Robbins should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie. I give this movie ****/****. This truly is the best movie of all time, it is definitely better than The godfather.",10
One of the best films I´ve ever seen. In the end I cried like a baby. Don´t miss this excellent movie.,7
This story truly is an emotional piece of art and show's a lifelike drama of a mid 20th centrury American prisoner and his friend's along with the struggles of injustice . It made me cry in the ending. This is a masterpiece on all levels .,10
"A beautiful film, finely crafted, and completely deserving of the cult status it has gained since losing the Academy Award for Best Picture (unjustly) to ""Braveheart"" in 1995. Tim Robbins will never top his performance as the wrongly-convicted Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman delivers the most effective voice-over narration in film history. I defy anyone not to be moved by the touching relationship between the two men, who grow old before our eyes as they serve out their sentences. One for history. I'll still get teary-eyed when I watch this fifteen years from now.",10
"Wow! This is a great film, one which surpasses anything I or anyone else could ever say about it. Truly one of the best films ever.",10
I love this film but it has simply been blown out of proportions.,10
"The acting is top-notch, the dialogue is superb, and even the cinematography only serves to highlight the first two. This movie never fails to bring a tear to my eye. The tears start about 10 minutes before the ending in anticipation. I've never used this word to describe a movie before, but it is beautiful.",1
"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.

This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.

King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.

What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",10
"Though I really enjoyed this movie, never would I agree that it is best film ever. It's powerful and full of heart, but it lacks one thing which is extremely important in a good film: originality. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were excellent in this film but their relationship is much like the relationship between Clint Eastwood and the librarian in ""Escape From Alcatraz."" The involvement of the library, the old coon who dies (Doc), the brut who is a threat (Wolf), the hole, the oppressive warden, and the escape in general all come from ""Escape From Alcatraz."" Though ""Escape From Alcatraz"" is not as powerful and emotional as ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" it is a brilliantly done film and has the originality which ""Shawshank"" lacks. Though I do not want to belittle those who worship ""Shawshank,"" I would suggest that anyone who has seen it should rent ""Escape From Alcatraz."" Then you may think twice before calling ""Shawshank"" the greatest film ever.",10
"Great movie! It deserves it's place of #1 out of 250! If you haven't seen it, see it. I don't know if it's possible to make a better version of this, because they did it perfectly the first time. It's a perfect example of the human spirit, as many critics have already said. Perfectly narrated, excellent acting, good script, nothing's missing!

The story's from Stephen King, in Four Seasons. This is under Fall, I believe. Stephen King wrote the novellas over a long period of time, and another movie that spawned from that book is Stand By Me.

If you haven't seen this, see it. If you want to see it, see it. If you don't want to see it, you're probably crazy, but see it anyways. The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect movie, and you should see it, if you haven't already.

4/4",3
"This movie is simply the greatest. Anybody can relate to the message of hope and the importance of freedom. If this movie can't inspire you to live your life to the fullest, I don't know what will. And I think all fans of this film will agree that the ending of this movie is the greatest. I must have breathed only three times while watching that. And critics complain that it's long. All the great movies are though. Anyway, whoever reads these comments and hasn't seen the film yet, go rent it. You will not regret it.",10
"Emotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite simply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay, casting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the ""cake"". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it. I know you will not be disappointed!

""Get busy livin'""",10
"I am happy to know that I am not the only one who thinks this is one of the best movies of all time. It's my personal favorite. It shows the determination of a person to live his life. How he works for years on his escape tunnel. The subplot of the parallel life outside of prison of Brooks and Freeman's character is excellent. I don't think any part of the movie is bad, not even avarage. It's perfect from beginning to end. The only probable flaw I see in it is that it makes criminals look better than they actually are, but that's the point.",10
"Tim Robbins smirks his way through this cheap rip-off of the >""Count of Monte Cristo"". The anti-Christian bigotry is too much >to stomach -- the murderous warden wears a cross, thumps a Bible >and utters fundamentalist platitudes. Morgan Freeman is very >solid tho",10
"I thought Shawshank was a gorgeous movie, wonderfully shot with beautiful production design. That said, I have a hard time watching the film. It drags-on for too long. I think the filmmakers were aiming for deep-thought provoking pacing, but I just got bored. The film moves slowly just so you can see how beautiful it is; personally, pretty pictures are not enough for me.",1
"Many people may be imprisoned by their own cages! No light, no tomorrow, no hope! Maybe you will sink because of this, but also may break through it, defeat it, and finally win the self sublimation! This movie seems to tell us that! Every time I watch it, every time I feel touched, I can have a lot of hope!",4
"Best movie ever made. Based on a Stephen King short story. I've seen it at least 20 times. It never gets boring. It's just overwelming and sorrowful. It makes you sad, angry and happy at the same time. Never forget, there is hope. Believe in your dreams.",10
The movie is the best prisons movies but i guess it needs a little more good writing,10
"The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.

I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.",10
Amazing Film. Very Good. Very Very Nice. The Shawshank Redemption(1994),10
Amazing movie - great direction - professional actors - not overrated it deserve to be where it is. This movie comes is my all time favorite movie list.,10
"There's not much to say about this masterpiece, it's spectacular in everything. Very entertaining and touching. This is a movie that you need to see before you die.",1
A great film which makes you think abot the most important things in life,10
"Good Movie. The first time I saw it, when it first came out in 1994, I thought that it was fantastic. But now that I have seen it approaching 15 times now (thanks to TNT), there a few things that I have noticed that have convinced me it does not deserve to be in the top ten or even the top 50 of all time.

I find the film to be unrealistic. The prison seems to exist in some sort of hyper-reality where people are either bad guys or good guys but there is absolutely no grey area. The prison and the prisoners are also very clean, neither have the lived-in quality that you would expect. I do not know if this feeling I get from the movie was on-purpose by the director Darabont, but I feel as the though the authenticity of the movie is not there. I also feel as though the movie is very manipulative of the audience's emotions in the way that the story is used to make the viewer feel a certain way about a character. Of course all movies are manipulative in this way. But I am very aware of it when I watch Shawshank. I was also aware of it when I watch movies like The Green Mile or The Hurricane, I feel as though these movies do not give the audience an opportunity to decide for themselves. Lastly I think that this movie was carried by the supreme acting, and that if the Freeman and Robbins were not so good it would not even deserve to be in the top 250.

Otherwise, I rooted for this movie get the oscar in 1994 because I thought it was a superior movie to Forest Gump.",10
"What an excellent movie!!! This has to be one of the best of all time. Morgan Freeman is excellent as always. Tim Robbins was superb. I've always believed Robbins was a decent actor, but he superceded any expectations I had. The movie is a real feel good movie. I recommend it for anyone over 15.",8
"This movie was a great adaptation of a great novella. Unlike many other movies made from books, this movie captured was almost an exact match.

A great commentary on how a person's environment can make them do strange things. I think Andy said something like ""I wasn't a criminal until I got to prison.""

Great movie!",10
"It's pretty obvious that this movie got to the top thanks to its publishing date (1994). IMDb became a viable site in 1994 and this was one of the best movies of that year. From there on - inertia. Why 6 out of 10? Cliché, Waaay tooo much. That's why IMDb should be ashamed of its algorith. Strike it down..",1
"Okay, i am obviously in the minority here, but i would not place this movie even among my top 100. Nevertheless, the Shawshank Redemption is a good movie and solid entertainment, filled with a compelling story, good actors and an accurate script. But i honestly can not see why this movie is appreciated so well; the cinematography is not that great and i have seen many more emotionally involving/uplifting movies as well, just think of The great dictator, The celebration (Festen), Leaving Las Vegas, etc.. 7/10",10
"I felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not know. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I felt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask myself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.

The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled across the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the film's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it move me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The ladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next many years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something more to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well told, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching. Because really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie, which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling.

Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to fantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out slowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film, where the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say that.

I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is simply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be disappointed.

I hope...",10
This is very awesome movie rtdfgcvtrfd t4efdgcvrtfd rrefd,10
If you like crime or prison films watch this. Has the highest film rating on IMDB (2020 February).,10
"I'll keep it short and sweet. The cinematography along with the storyline, paired with the perfect cast make this one of my favorite movies of all time!",10
I could re-re-rewatch this every time. Must watch!,9
Based on the Stephen King's book. It made me think about a lot of things.,1
"Salvation in Shawshank begins with a mysterious and enigmatic atmosphere (the result of Frank Darabont's decoupage and perfect atmosphere) and the arrival of Andy Dufresne (a first-class banker accused of killing his wife) to the prison location. By creating a narrator and a relative change of perspective and throwing the burden of narration on the shoulders of the rejectionist (Morgan Freeman), he invites the audience to judge Doferrin and watch his character from a greater distance.",10
"I have no idea why this rates so highly. The whole premise is completely unrealistic. Its an OK prison film, but even Escape from Alcatraz is much better.",1
"I like this movie all right, I would not rank it on my top movies of all time and I am also not the type of person to give every movie I see either a nine or ten or one and two. There are six other numbers in between and I use them all and I say this one warrants a seven. The movie about two inmates becoming friends in a corrupt prison has its charm. It also has its bad points that being the evil prison system with its mean warden and guards who batter the prisoners. Still, I can role with that as I can the fact that Tim Robbins is horribly cast in this film. When he first arrives at Shawshank he does the role perfectly, however his performance never changes throughout the movie. He still talks softly, still has the same look, the guy has supposedly spent some time here so he is going to change even if he does not lose his hope. There are many positives too though as Morgan Freeman literally carries the film and I loved the ending escape scenes. I also like the fact I can just start watching this movie in the middle and just go on doing something else. Maybe pick it up again later at the beginning, it is just one of those movies that I can watch it from here or there and be entertained, but do not necessarily feel I have to watch it from beginning to end. I know I am now going to be attacked though as I did not give this movie a nine or ten though. Especially attacking a movie that so many people think is the greatest thing ever, however this is just an opinion so just chill. At least I did not like it and give it a one to lower its score like some people have.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film about people, which is becoming increasingly rare these days where movies merely showcase special effects or action.

The film seems slow but that is the point. It must convey the slow passage of time, as we see Andy and Red lives in the prison. Its a film that makes us think as well as feel, and that is what makes it truly great.

Tim Robbins' performance is incredible, making Andy out to be a complete person with real thoughts and feelings. He IS Andy, not simply an actor going through the motions. He is the film's heart.

And That make's Morgan Freeman's Red it's soul. It is his point of view that carries us through the film, making Andy seem even more mysterious because he is never quite sure what Andy is up to.

A Wonderful film that suceeds on so many levels. A must see for anyone, even if you don't think you will like a film about prison that is so long and may seem slow. See it anyway! It earns its place on the top 250 list with heart and style. We watched it in a sociology class and it is the only movie I have ever seen that has a climax capible of moving an entire room full of jaded college students to standing ovation. A true masterpiece!

PS: In one of the scenes on the bus (I forget if it is when Brooks or Red gets out) a woman with short reddish curly hair can be seen (At least in widescreen) She was my math teacher in high school, and most of the movie was filmed around my hometown of Mansfield. I just felt like mentioning this.",4

"It's not just a movie, it's hope, life, death and trying to survive.",10
"This movie is one of the best movies of all time. At first the title+the poster of this movie might seems boring and uninteresting. Once you start watching this movie, you cannot stop. This movie will inspire you to not give up in your life like what Andy Dufresne said ""Get busy living or get busy dying"".

This movie is the master piece of art. The flow of the story, the editing of each scenes, the acting of the actors, and everything else in this movie are perfectly combined together. Shanwshank Redemption is a must-see movie.",7
Yep...this is it...an absolute masterpiece that is timeless,10
"I've read the novella from ""Different Seasons,"" and feel that Frank Darabont's screenplay was an excellent refinement of King's story. It pretty much sticks with the original plot while eliminating some portions which didn't add much to the story as a whole. The only part I wish they would have included (that they didn't) was Red's tales of other breaks at Shawshank Prison, if only for the novelty of them. Regarding the movie alone, I thought the grand aerial views of the prison combined with Thomas Newman's score (especially the 'Stoic Theme') were quite wonderful, almost breathtaking in their scope and power. I would have to say this is by far Tim Robbins' best role to date while it at least is among Morgan Freeman's top three cinematic performances. I have seen this movie several times, and although I'd say the first viewing is the best, I never tire of experiencing the story of Andy and Red, their story of hope.",10
"Its greatness resides in that it makes you feel; that's what makes it a masterpiece of modern cinema. Without artifice, or lies, or unnecessary entanglement, Perpetual Chain is brutally honest, like life itself. It has scenes that are pieces of Cinema in capital letters, you know, the one that grabs you by the lapels and whispers in your ear: wake up. This film talks about hope and love of life, about how to survive hell with determination, about keeping dreams alive even if you haven't seen the sunlight for two months, about friendship. Open your eyes wide when you see it because it may teach you what really matters",10
"It's the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Without a doubt, this movie along with Gladiator are the best in history.",2
"Its literally my favorite movie. I can watch it over and over again. The acting is of course amazing. Ah I simply can't put in words how I feel about this movie. I LOVE IT! In my opinion its a must watch movie! I totally recommend it.

Oh Did I say that I LOVE IT!? Well.... I LOVE IT!!!",10
"Nice film i cant speak english but nice, yes nice the best",9
Great movie. One of my favourite movie of all time. A prisoner life is shown as the movie . Especially we also experience that .,6
"It's a fantastic film based of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. I adore this film, truly. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Frank Darabont as a director. What's not to love? Maybe not THE BEST film ever, but it's up there.

The novella is very good, if a little sentimental. The film is a masterpiece, though, that I actually prefer to the source material. Anyways, it's a must watch. Timeless.",10
Well this one was good but I think it is too overrated,10
"My heart did back flips when I discovered that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" had been rated the #2 movie overall by users of the IMDb. There is little that can parallel my satisfaction of knowing that the viewing public can still tell excellent film when they see it, despite dangerous competition with other pictures of its time. Particularly in a year (1994) which saw the release of Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", family-friendly blockbuster ""The Lion King"", and the now-immortal ""Forrest Gump"" (all of which are, indeed, outstanding films) it would have been easy for ""Shawshank"" to glide under the radar of North American audiences of the time, and of future years. Yet here it stands, one of the most widely recognized and highly praised movies of the century.

But why? What of the films like ""Forrest Gump"", ""The Lion King"", and ""Pulp Fiction""? How has ""The Shawshank Redemption"" stood stronger against the test of time than its award-sweeping, box office-smashing contemporaries? Much of the credit goes to writer Frank Darabont, whose screen adaptation of Stephen King's short story assembles the plot of the film in such a way, that this movie gets better and better every time you watch it, while all the time spelling out an inspiring and important message of hope and, as the titles indicates, redemption.

Brought to life by a stellar cast and splendid cinematography, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is proof that given the time, the cream always rises to the top.",7
"I have seen this movie and think it is very good, Tim Robbins is really good in it and Morgan Freeman as usual is great. It has a lot of original ideas and is deserving of much praise, however i really feel it lacks something that The Godfathers 1 and 2 have. They are just a different caliber of movie no offense to it, its very good. However Al Pacino in both of those films is as close to perfect of a performance as you will ever get. I really feel because it is 35 years old so many people of todays generation has not seen it, I am 20 and own all three and can appreciate the talent by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the first film and Al in the second with Francis Ford Coppola directing both. I understand that when someone sees a movie and they would like to rate it on this site its difficult to see all the other movies on the top 250, but when you are dealing with the top 5 its not that hard, see those movies and then judge.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic film from the beginning right till the end. It is really beautiful. The direction and script are really superb. The acting of Morgan Freeman is exceptional. If Forrest Gump was made on another year, he would certainly have got an Oscar.

If you want me to describe the movie in one word,I would say, "" Beautiful."" The story was very good, the storytelling was better. The scriptwriter deserves an applause.

It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It certainly deserves a spot in the top 250. But having said that, I don't think this movie should be #1. It will be like a disgrace to the movies like Schindler's list and Forrest Gump because those movies really touched my heart. I think Schindler's List and Forrest Gump should come above Shawshank Redemption.

1 thing I forgot to tell you. I liked the dialogue of Morgan Freeman with the parole evaluator. It was absolutely heart touching. This movie has a hidden propaganda. Well, not particularly hidden, anyway. It is about the question of imprisoning people. Should it be done??Do we have the right to do that?? Wouldn't it be better if we try to talk some sense into them?? Or, wouldn't it even be better if we kill them rather than to give them life sentences?? I think I have an answer but that shouldn't be discussed because I think this question will continue to be a moral dilemma of the human community

I really liked that dialogue. Rehabilitated?? Let me tell you something sonny, that word is for politicians so that you can wear a suit and a tie and can have a job. Brilliant. Heart touching.

This movie is an emotional dilemma folded together into an easily understandable story. There is one more thing I need to put here. Most o f the people who have rated this movie # 1 haven't got a clue about this hidden message. They have rated this because of the surprise ending. This is an open criticism.",1
"I'm a 290 pound, mean-looking dude, but I cried like a baby watching this movie.

This is a masterpiece in American story telling.

Every scene builds up the tension.

Every dialog adds depth.

Every central character makes sense.

The ending makes you smile.

Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freemans acting is simply outstanding. Throughout the movie, you feel you get to know their inner thoughts, their longings, their fears.

FANTASTIC! MARVELOUS! INGENIOUS!",10
"I simply do not know how some people out there voted this movie anything less than a 6 or 7, but a small percentage had the audacity to vote it a ""ONE""! There are always that small percentage. Sometimes I believe people vote down other movies in some attempt to get THEIR favorite movie into a certain spot. The fact that people put that much effort into doing so amazes me. I'll take the time to comment on a movie and give my 2 cents worth of opinion. This movie was a classic the day it premiered and the 2nd place showing overall demonstrates that without fault. My hope is those who voted it down somehow obtain a clue.",6
"I've heard of this movie before i saw it, to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue, man!!! when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute, its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the American cinema's history ... I'd like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it, i give it up for their great effort that will last in every one's memory for his life time. I'm sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me, I did my best to deliver what i think. Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.",6

"Amazing,Mindblowing ! I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.",10
"Simply a masterpiece, i was a fan of Morgan Freeman since long years, but watching The Shawshank is something different, stories, life, prison, concipracy, words said never forgotten... For me, my best complete movie ever with stunning narration and end.. What to say ? All what you need is here..",10
"All I have to say is that this movie is perfect. It has to be one of the best movies ever made and in my opinion, it's the second best movie ever made. After I watched it for the first time, I was amazed. The ending is wonderful and the plot of the movie was PERFECT. Good action, good actors, amazing plot.....what do you want more? I watched it two times and I never get bored while watching it. This movie remains in your mind forever and you will want to watch it every time you will get the chance. Some scenes are amazing and they remain in your mind. Believe me, watch it and you will never regret it.

10/10.",5
"This movie is absolutely fine. It is very well made. Great acting. Great cinematography. Tight script and interesting complex characters. That being said, it's a bit contrived. The bad guys are just a little too bad and the good guys just a little too good. The moral is a little obvious and telegraphed. It's fun in parts, but honestly a little uncomfortable in parts that doesn't really make up for the relative lack of realism. I wouldn't say this movie is unrealistic, but it's contrived in a very obvious way. It feels ""written"" not lived. Now I know this movie is beloved, and it is a very well made movie, without question, but the kind of obvious nature of the story makes this personally for me not one of the greats, but one of the goods. I am happy its found an audience, though.",8
"Best movie ever, I enjoyed it a lot. The Shawshank Redemption received positive reviews on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, to the general unpopularity of prison films, lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. It went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box-office gross to $58.3 million.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is amazingly powerful story about two friends life in prison. The characters Andy and Red are fundamentally good men in a hostile environment. This is a quietly narrated movie, by Red (Morgan Freeman) and gives an up close, raw depiction of lives served in prison and the ongoing trials of several inmates. This film is a compelling story of redemption.",10
"So everybody in the world thinks I am insane for having never seen ""The Shawshank Redemption"", so I finally broke down and rented it the other day. What I thought was going to be a really good film turns out to be nothing but a bunch of hoop-la sandwiched in-between opening and closing credits amounting to nothing. What a snooze fest this turned out to be. I was bored almost 90% of the movie and have decided to make a list of things I would have rather spent the two hours of my life doing instead of torturing myself with what I consider to be one of the worst 5 movies ever made (don't get me started on Pulp Fiction).

1. Wash dishes

2. Let a burning candle drip wax on my arm

3. Drive 60 miles and turn around and drive back without stopping

4. Practice getting my tetris score just a bit higher

5. Count silently in my head to 10,000

6. Beat King's Quest I again

There are countless other things I would rather do that watch this horrible movie again, but I think you get the point. Do not believe the hype surrounding this movie because you will just end up hurt and bitter like I did.",10
"It is an amazing movie. One of the best movies I have seen in my life. I like it very much. I think everyone should watch this movie. What a great screenplay. And the climax of the movie is amazing. I think whoever watches this movie will like it. I felt the tension when I was watching the movie. Dialogues are good. We have a lot to learn from this movie. The intelligence of the hero was extraordinary. He was constantly engaged in his work. He has thought of everyone with him. His work revealed many things. The more I watch the movie, the more I like it. I love this movie. Must watch everyone.",10
"This is an excellent movie, whether it is direction, or cinematography or editing, each and every frame looks brilliant. In fact it is a trendsetting film and I would like to watch it again and again. And last but not the least the background score is also awesome. The background music and the story are weaved together in such a way that it doesn't look that these are two different things. It's like they are made for each other. Each and every character of the movie has given an unforgettable performance and I appreciate each and every technicians' and artistes' hard work which they have put into this movie.",9
awesome movie...the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb...one of my favorite movies...!!! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie's can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.,10
"This film is based on one of my favourite Stephen King novels (albeit a 'novella') The original book contained four long 'short stories' one which became 'Stand By Me' (another great movie) and 'Rita Heyworth & The Shawshank Redemption' which has been (full marks to the director& production team)lovingly rendered into a true cinematic masterpiece. Staying true to the printed word, it follows the prison life of Andy Dupree from sentence to freedom with care and sympathy, never revelling in his hardships or flouting his attempts at beating the system. The film concentrates on his will to survive and his hope for eventual freedom. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman were born to play their respective parts in this film. If neither had ever made another film, it would not matter because this film will always be their mark in movie history. No major action sequences, no breathtaking special effects and no outrageous subject matter. Just a great movie, based on a great story, acted convincingly with great skill by two men who could really be the best of friends the story requires them to be. Superb.",8
A classic movie that you can watch over and over again. Brilliant performances by all actors and actresses.,10
"Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale. It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like. People like fairy tales, so both these movies were very popular.",9
"this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I have watched this movie over two dozen times. I never tire of seeing ""Andy Get Them"". the lack of awards that this movie recieve was a true travesty. Tim Robbins performance ranks as quite possibly his best and considering who we are talking about that is saying alot. Morgan Freeman talent overshadow the fact that he was not like his character in the book. The rest of the cast though for the most part nameless is extraordinary. Chief among them though is Ron Perlman. There cant be anyone who didnt feel a great swell of joy when they heard the chess piece go through the poster. This is one of the greatest cinema moments i have ever witnessed. This film taps into you and elicts a great emotion. This is something few movies have or ever will do, but it is what makes this one of the greatest films ever made.",1

"Gospel song and praises still remains one of the best Medium of communicating with God. No doubt, you will leave to enjoy all the good musics and song been uploaded to Musicbasin,",10
"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.",9
IT WAS AMAZING AND WONDERFUL BUT I WANT WATCH AGAIN,9
"I have seen this film so many times over the years and each time I watch it, I find something new. It's a film that takes me through a ride of emotions from tears of sadness to tears of happiness. It's a tale of hardship and friendship. The casting and dynamic of the actors is first class. This will always be my favourite Movie.",10
"I first saw this film when it came out in 1994 and unlike what most people may have thought, I loved it. I thought that it should have most definitely taken the Best Picture award over the vastly inferior and vastly overrated Pulp Fiction. This is the kind of film that comes along only once in a lifetime. The story, the gripping performances, the settings, the acting, everything molds together to make such a work of art. This goes beyond film making I believe. I'm having a loss for words to describe this piece of cinematic brilliance.

The best I can say is that you just have to see this for yourself to be able to appreciate its beautiful storytelling and the message it gives you. Watching this movie will give you hope and courage. Courage to get through your everyday life. To overcome any obstacles you may encounter on your path in life. This movie is simply this powerful. Rent it or better yet, buy it now and witness for yourself why this is #2 on the top 250 list. Personally, it's #1 for me and a lot of others.",10
"This movie takes place off in fantasy land somewhere. Absolutely ridiculous. Anyone with a brain who knows how the real world works would not fall for this fairy tale. Go watch ""Escape From Alcatraz"". That's what this is ripping off so badly anyway. Alcatraz is the original. I did almost add an extra star for Tim Robbins though. You look beautiful darling!",8
Saw this movie after seeing imdb top rated movies and doubted what s wrong with those people who consider this movie as a masterpiece. the movie is so plain i understand it is a old movie and a feel good one but keeping it number 1 above pulp fiction or prestige movies does nt make any sense,10
"I saw this movie about a year ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. Everything about this movie is so perfect and if I'd have to choose one favourite scene it'd have to be the scene where Andy and Red enjoys a beer on the rooftop, Even though this movie is a bit old I still didn't think about it at all while watching it.

I ussually don't give movies such high reviews but this one definetly deserves a 10 out of 10!",9
Hands down one of the best movies i've ever seen. I was glued to the screen for the entirety of this film and invested fully in to the story within. Amazing.,10
On of my all time favorite movies. Its a great story line with great talent.,10
"Not a spoiler but a ? Well the whole movie was compelling but noted something forgotten how good it was when i first saw it 25 years ago but perhaps a missed fact or? Well when they couldn't find the gun thrown in the river to identify and compare to crime scene, yet they found bullets and broken glass where his car was, wouldn't those bullets at his car be different from the ones at the crime scene ....would have proved his story but other than than, unless he was deliberately framed by someone but it doesn't even touch on that...",9
This movie is life the greatest picture ever. I loving it.,9
"Why this film is so highly rated is beyond me. First of all, where is the redemption? The characters do nothing that can be construed as redeeming (except for the one played by Gil Bellows). They simply survive.

Someone who also doesn't like the film compares it to a fairy tale because it's unrealistic. This is an insult to fairy tales. Fairy tales are beautiful and deep, with complex motives transmitted throughout the centuries, the traditional good-bad dichotomy and a clear moral conclusion. The Shawshank Redemption is dull, with some basic and carefully explained symbolism (because apparently we're too stupid to get it otherwise) and, contrary to traditional notions of morality, the hero's sidekicks are some nice criminals. Of course, prison staff are cast as the bad guys and their boss is portrayed as a hypocrite speaking of the Bible yet acting in an un-Christian manner. Can you say anti-Christian bigotry?",8
"Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.

* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a Beautiful, Touching film that can not be described in words how truly wonderful it is. I mean, come on, what can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Everyone I know (almost everyone) loves this movie. My sister (at the moment) has never seen this movie! I beg her everyday to watch it with me but she keeps putting it off. She has NO CLUE what an amazing film she isn't watching. The impact that this film has had on me, along with everyone else who has seen it, is massive. This film makes you realize how wonderful life is and how great people are (even those in jail). It defines the word Hope better then Webster's dictionary does.Also, it is in my opinion, the best film adaptation of a Stephen King story.

10/10",1
"How the Shawshank Redemption is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time is unfathomable to mean. Infact there are films in the prison genre which I have found to be more effectively made than the Shawshank Redemption. Is the film bad? No, infact it's quite the contrary. The performances from the two lead characters are undoubtabely compelling, the film very effectively pulls at your heart springs, and allows you to feel sympathy for supposed criminals. The film is also well crafted from a technical standpoint, with good use of camera angles, and pleasantly crafted cinematography. The film, however, can best be described as unremarkable. Infact, while some may find it difficult to concede, it seems as though the film weaponizes sentimentality to pander to its audience. The film about the brutality of prison, and the corrupt nature of mankind shouldn't have the tone of a cheesy soap opera, and certainly shouldn't be cleanly wrapped together like a christmas present. The inoffensive, and uncontroversial nature of Shawshank redemption is borderline cringe inducing, and perhaps this seems hyperbolized, but here's an analogy that best describes the problem with the film. Imagine if the godfather who beats up talia shires character gets killed and talia shires smiles and begins hugging her brother and talking about how she can start over her life again. That analogy pretty much sums up the operative problem with shawshank redemption. Its a good movie, well acted, technically impressive, well written, full of compelling moments, however it is simply conventional, and far too pandering. Certainly far from being one of the greatest films of all time.",10
It was shocking to know initially that this masterpiece was not accepted by audience when it was released.Well it was too ahead of it's time.It shows real character development of Red...a unwise hothead kid to a wise man who accepted his wrong doing.What I like the most was its ability to tell an extraordinary story in a very pleasant and simple appealing way.I like the simplicity of the storytelling process.Its a masterpiece no doubt in it.Its a great story.,9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about a hotshot banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison. He remains hopeful and makes friends especially with a blackmarketeer named ""Red""( Morgan Freeman). I really don't see how this movie could possibly be the #2 film of all time, the movie is nothing groundbreakingly amazing, it is pretty poorly directed, the plot is thinner than air,there are no risks taken,and there is no thought provoked through watching the film that it only needs to one viewing to get the whole movie, in fact you wouldn't even need to watch the film to even understand how the movie is going end. The title already gives away the whole ""big"" finale of the movie. I don't see how anyone could possibly compare THIS to actually great movies like EVERYTHING that is below is on the Top 25. And the simple thought of this winning Best Picture back in '94, HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!, it would have given me somethingh to laugh at for the rest of my life, I still can't possibly see how the Academy could have even nominated this as the Best Picture of 1994. Anyway the only thing that saves the film of Morgan Freeman and it is only thing that even got me to see this film in the first place but it still can't stop me from giving this a poor grade.

2/10",9
When I signed up for the IMDB they ask you what your favourite movie is? Shawshank rose to the top of my mind immediately. This film brought hope and inspiration to most hopeless and soul robbing of environments. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic! Does Steven King have more stories like this one?,10
Well what else can I say about a Masterpiece! 10/10,10
One of the best films I've ever seen is a masterpiece.,8
"I really enjoyed watching this film with my family and friends,can recommend it.",9
No words needed to describe this movie everything is composed really beautifull just watch,9
The movie is about an accountant who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and as a result is sentenced for a life in prison. The movie is filled with deep meanings but unfortunately it is very boring and directed in a very lame way. Plus the musical score is preety bad and does not spark any emotions from you. In this type of movie an emotional and memorable musical score is very important but somehow the filmmakers did not seem to care.,8
If you are above 12 then I make sure that you heard this name once in your lifetime and if not then no harm but if you want to watch a true performance then just watch this one with patience.,10
"This is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second.",9
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other ""great film"", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank Redemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced.

I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing.

I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema.",10
This movie was great! I loved the character development throughout the movie. It's great to know that the film was later released a second time for a well deserved box-office success. The box-office flop from its initial release definitely doesn't even come close to the master piece this movie is! Definitely one of my top 10!,10
"This has to be one of the best, if not the best, movie I have ever seen. Combining the masterful acting skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Frank Darabont blends empathy with brutal physical and emotional violence to the best possible effects. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is wonderful, whilst clinical, precise and realistic writing from Stephen King ensures that this is one of the most worthy candidates for Movie of the Decade. If you only ever see one movie for the next 10 years, see this one.",10
"All right people, without giving away any spoilers, I can sum up the Shawshank Redemption in one word: FLAWLESS. To me, this movie is second only to American Beauty, due to the latter's thought provoking aura; however, technically speaking, this is the ultimate cinema achievement. While it is almost impossible to single out a perfect film, the Shawshank Redemption is a serious contender for the title of best movie ever made. Now I know people will gloat about Citizen Kane's cinematography or The Godfather's character development, but the Shawshank Redemption beats them all technically wise (watch the movie and see how everything works out flawlessly, it's really something quite special). The movie has a unique charm about it, evoking a tranquil response from the audience. The ultimate feel good film, the Shawshank Redemption is a monument of cinema greatness. The only thing the Godfather has over the Shawshank Redemption is the status of a classic, largely due to critics' praise; on the other hand, movies after the 1980's are considered as the ""fall of cinema,"" or so it would appear through a critic's POV. Well, those movies have something that the so called classics do not, and that is the humane factor. After all, we are humans with feelings, and I think that through ""art achievements"" such as the Shawshank Redemption, human creativity itself is elevated to a higher status. Evoking emotion in the audience, one of Shawshank's greatest strengths, is what makes the cinema experience what it is: the pinnacle of human achievements.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is honestly one of the greatest movies ever.I was too young when i watched it for the first time and i didn't get much,so i watched it again some months ago.At the end i was left with a feeling of freedom and perhaps redemption.This movie gives you hope,which in my opinion is very importand.It is a movie about human dignity,about always trying to be a better person.The Shawshank Redemption is meant to change the person that watches it.I give it a 10,although it deserves much more.

Apart from these,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely excellent. If i had to describe their performances with one word that would be overwhelming.

Let's hope more movies like this come out.",10
I am reviewing this movie soooo late but i watched it late and this was my best decision that i made of watching this movie. It was amazing. Hands down 👍🏼,8
"As a younger viewer who wasnt born when the movie released, I can by heart say that movieproductions has gone downhill. Im not pointing out that all movies we produce today are bad, but that in 25 years of evolving in technology and having good actors, writers etc. No movies would stand a chance to being as good as this was. This movie shows the true art of directing and storytelling.

Its a kind of movie that got me thinking, learning and at the same time connect emotionally with the characters.

I pat myself on the back for going on IMDB and hitting the top rated movies of all time. If I didnt, I wouldnt have had the chance to view this masterpiece.",10
"I only need to write a few words. This film made me laugh, cry, cheer and feel warm inside. Not a lot of films are capable of doing that. The acting is brilliant and so believable. It's quite a long film, but rightfully so. You are actually left feeling like you want more. Even writing these words down makes me want to get it out and watch it again. It is always a good time to watch this film. You will not regret it.I'm actually surprised it hasn't got a full 10 stars.

To the director i would say, Thank you for making this film!

If you haven't seen it, watch it, right now. It doesn't matter what time it is...go!

seriously go now!",9
"I have seen Shawshank Redemption for more than 10 times and being a critic i have noticed couple of things that really make the movie little dull and listless.It is not to say that the movie is not good. It is pretty good, with all the technical merits - But it doesn't merit a ranking of 9.3 at all. Which is why you can see i rated it pretty low, as compare to God father or God father 2.

One of the factors affecting my rating is the speed of the movie and the plot,it is little diverted and you are not quite sure to understand what the guy is up to. Though curiosity is pretty good in any movie, but this time around curiosity has killed the cat and made the movie little boring.

So in my opinion, Shaw shank Redemption is good but not GREAT.",10
this an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable 20years dug in the jail without no body know and abbreviation this is a great movie and this is form a few great movies you will see it in your life and is to be enough the writer was the greatest writer in the world Stephen king Tim Robinson give all he have in this film and Morgan free man he give unforgettable part in his Lief and how was believe the bad and strong officer at the end crying and they take him to punshid him above he did and Tim Robinson pushed the administrator of the jail to suicide after he take all his money this movie i will can't forget it for along time he will be in my memory for ever,9
Ok sue me for being different but I'm not sure how this slow paced film rose to the top of the IMDb scoreboard.,10
"It seems as if every movie has something about it that is unbelievable, and this movie does have one part, but except for that it is a 10 all the way which is what I rated it. Excellent story line, acting, drama, humor, relationships... you name it. A 10 all the way.",9
"Was a great Movie !! I love the story and the actors were fantastic. There is so much to say about this movie. But look, seriously, look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end. Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie, so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. The Movie Picture is very good. good angles of shooting, always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. And finally, check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. See the movie, enjoy and learn! To finish just saying that it as a great movie, oh wait, i already said that, no problem its to highlight the idea.",10
"I finally saw this movie. I wanted to rent it after seeing this is the number two favorite movie of all time. But I could never find it in the video store or library. Of all places, I finally saw it on television! In the age of predictable plots, I could not predict this movie at all until the very last few seconds it reveals the events. We watch movies for the truth and there are lots in this one. There are some valuable lessons here: never lose hope, always do your best wherever you go, persistence, persistence.",10
"This movie is the best example of that. It is solid, good movie, fine story, has a "" optimistic message about hope"" and has a happy end. Actors are fine, nothing special and storyline is somewhat naive. By no means this is 9.3 movie. It is simply overrated, it has incredible hype and lots of people put it on their ""best list"" by default. This is 7.3-7.4 movie at best. It has many flaws, story is not dramatic enough, it is not real and raw. Story is a bit naive also, Tim Robbins is so-so at best. It is worth to watch, but nothing more.",10
"An incredible movie, with an incredible cast and crew! Well Done!",10
"I love this movie. It truly is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. A timeless classic. It gets the full 10 from me. It sends us numerous messages and has hidden meanings. Its so beautifully laid out and filmed. It teaches us a lot about ex convicts also. Yes, they may have did wrong to go to prison but some can't handle the outside world the way they used to. It has all the emotions embedded in it. Funny, sad, happy, deep all of those emotions and more. I would definitely recommend this movie to everybody I meet. Its beautifully shot to capture the essences of every character and their feelings and emotions. The writing is spectacular. As a writer myself I like to look at the writing and acting. I'm also an actress so those are the two qualities I focus on. The story line is extremely important. If it doesn't make sense then it ruins the movie completely. The acting in this was sensational. The storyline was genius. Definitely worth the full 10 out of 10 rating that I am giving it.",7
"This movie is all time best.The Shawshank Redemption has all feeling (hope,angry,happinies etc.).A masterpiece",9
"Based on a short story by legendary writer Stephen King, this movie tells a story about prison. How a simple man, who did his living got wrongfully convicted to prison and now he has to survive in that hell-hole.

Slowly, the protagonist makes friends and learns to survive through his belief and using his mind practically. Hope and perseverance made him survive through all the terror.

This movie is example of an excellent story with incomparable story telling skills. This movie had earned the title of most rated movie in IMDb and is on the watchlist of every movie fan.

Trivia Stephen King has considered this to be one of his favorite film adaptations based on his own work. Stephen King never cashed his $1,000 cheque for rights to the film. Several years after the movie came out, King got the cheque framed, and mailed it back to Frank Darabont with a note inscribed, ""In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve."" The film's initial gross of $18 million could not even cover the cost of its production. It did another $10 million in the wake of its Oscar nominations, but the film was still deemed to be a box-office failure.

Quotes Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. Get busy living, or get busy dying.

Thanks for reading ❤",9
People love it because they expect to beforehand...it's a bog standard prison movie.. nothing special..passes a few hours if your bored but the sort of movie u only need watch once .,9
"I have seen this movie around 10-15 times, and every time I see it i discover something new and interesting. The story has one of the best story lines and the connection between the actors Morgan Freemam(Ellis Boyd Redding)and Tim Robbin(Andy Dufresne) is wonderful. The Shawshank Redemption shows what does go on in prison and sort of makes you think hows some normal people can become wise and crafty convicts. This movie somewhat reminds me of another great movie ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" in that the character can go from completely normal to somewhat nuts. And the cruel institutes in which people are put in, make excuses for their wrong doings, and treat people like they are dirt. I truly enjoyed this movie, and for whoever is reading this i'm sure if you see this movie, you will enjoyed just as much as i have.",9
"I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was on the big screen. Let me say something about how movie-goers in my country watch their movies at the cinemas. They always leave before the credits at the end of the movie is up. But it was different with Shawshank Redemption (S.R.) Most of the audience just sat on although there were not many because it was a working day. All who stayed on for the ending credits were obviously moved by the movie. I stayed on to learn who wrote the story. As I left the first thing on my mind was ""I've got to get hold of the novel from which this movie is made. Some years later the VCD version is in the market. I have watched it in the comfort of my home several times and find that I still enjoy it at every viewing. I am puzzled how a movie this good could let Forrest Gump sweep all the price. It makes me doubt the credibility of the Academy of Performing Arts. This is a story about Friends. When one has a true friend, no matter how bad the situation is it makes life tolerable.",8
"quite simply, the shawshank redemption is my absolute, long-standing, favourite film, and i know it always will be. it is a timeless masterpiece that transcends genres, a film that can appeal to everyone with its simple message - hope is important.",9
"Let me start by saying that I always enjoy watching this film. It is perhaps one of the ultimate Hollywood feel-good movies. However, to call a film one of the greatest of all time, you need to compare it with many films of all types, and from many sources. This film is above average Hollywood fayre, and does indeed look very good compared to most of the over-hyped brain-disengaged tosh Hollywood produces.

I am suspicious of most film top 100's, 10's etc etc in any case. They are as much a reflection of the average age and experience of those voting than any intrinsic value of the film.

Withouit wanting to be disrespectful, anyone who feels this film uniquely opens their eyes to certain fundamental truths about the human condition, would do better watching Sondeburgh's highly accessible, but more profound exploration on love, loss, faith, hope and redemption ""Solaris"". The adventurous might also check out Tarkovsky's 1972 Russian version!",10
"Simply put, this was one of the most brilliant, unbelievable films I have ever seen. I had never read the Stephen King novella, but in a way I'm glad I didn't. I honestly can't think of a single thing I would criticize about this movie: the acting was amazing, the dialogue incredible, the score moving. I knew a lot of people who hadn't seen this, and I recommended it to all of them. Most of them came back and told me how much they loved it and they couldn't believe they hadn't seen it sooner. This is one of those movies that will be remembered forever by those who have seen it. Those who haven't are definitely missing out on a superb piece of work. I enjoy it more every time I see it, and can't believe it didn't win the Oscar (it deserved many!) when it first came out.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Netflix. The storyline follows a man in prison whose job is to get hard to get things for the prisoners in prison for trade. One day a unique prisoner comes in who is very calculated and has his own ways of getting what he wants. The two men become friends to get through their days serving their life sentences.

This movie is directed by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile) and stars Morgan Freeman (Se7en), Tim Robbins (Mystic River), William Sadler (Demon Knight), Bob Gunton (Daredevil), Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers) and Jeffrey DeMunn (The Mist).

The storyline for this picture is absolutely amazing and does a fantastic job of covering so many topics - life in prison, the personalities of those in prison, the struggles of getting out of prison and returning to normalcy and the will to survive. The dialogue is very good and the movie concludes perfectly. There's so much to like about this film. I would score this an easy 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",6
"Tim Robbins is wealthy banker ""Andy Dufresne"" who finds himself sentenced to life imprisonment after his wife and her lover are found murdered. The handsome ""new fish"" is initially the target of the ""sisters"" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison ""scrounger"" Morgan Freeman (""Red""). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including ""Warden Norton"" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it's more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole. The last half hour is up there with the best cinema has ever had to offer, and this - again on a big screen - is a must see adaptation of one of Stephen King's lesser known, but better, stories that delivers a redemption never, quite, anticipated by the prison service!",10
"'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' is easily one of my favourite films of all time (top three material, for sure). It is a true classic that holds the honour of being the highest rated film on IMDb (with a 9.3/10) for good reason. Some scenes will make you laugh, some scenes will make you cry and some scenes will make you do both all at the same time. Each moment will keep you thoroughly entertained and riveted to your seat throughout. It's thanks to well-developed characters and a deeply-effecting story, one that deals with timeless and powerful themes of hope, that this remains such a seminal piece of work. A true masterpiece. 10/10",9
"""Prison is no fairy tale world."" Red Redding (Morgan Freeman)

This quote is partly true in the context of the super-popular melodrama (based on a Stephen King short story), The Shawshank Redemption. As the opening 1947 scenes in Shawshank Prison in author King's Maine (actually filmed in Mansfield, Ohio), the hero, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is raped multiple times by the ""Sisters."" That's to be expected from what prison lore offers over the years in movies and reality.

After Andy gets through these humiliations, and Morgan Freeman intones writer-director Frank Darabont fine script about life inside and out, the story turns almost into a fairy tale: Former bank vice president Andy brings his business skills to high and low: warden, guards, and prisoners. Additionally, he and Red make like a buddy film out of the boredom of everyday prison life.

The intersection of being sent to the hole for months and working the system to almost a vacation world creates an incarceration nostalgia that seems too Hollywood fantastic to be real. Andy's acquisition through Red of a rock hammer and a poster of Rita Hayworth not only expresses his love of geology and pop culture, it also reveals the salutary effect of the arts in lonely times.

When Andy plays an Italian opera over the loudspeaker, Red's narration describes the music like a beautiful bird. It's paradise for a brief moment.

Hope is the operative theme, hope that Andy and Red will someday be free to enjoy the Mexican Pacific Ocean: ""They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory."" Andy

As entertainment in a time when we have been imprisoned by a pandemic, Shawshank Redemption is a welcome antidote. Our own romantic hope is to be free of a tyrannical virus.",9
"A film of hope, lessons, life and freedom. This is one of the greatest films of our times - highly recommended viewing!

9/10.",9
"I can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie. But I saw it was going to be on tv tonight so I sat down and watched it. It was time well spent. The acting was excellent (especially Tim Robbins), the storyline was interesting...everything was great. As another reviewer mentioned, the time flies by when you're watching it. When the movie finished, I looked at the clock and was amazed that 3 hours had gone by. I'll certainly watch this movie again.",10
"Just rewatched it in 2020, such a wonderful story behind the scenes and great performance by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

Kind of movie to put on the list, for your little childs to watch when they'll grow.

For me, The Shawshank Redemption is very relaxing and different from other movies, which can be watched an rewatched with friends, family or alone.

Everyone who did not watched it yet, definitely should do it.",7
"After years of hearing people praise this film, and occasionally catching snippets of it on TV, I made a point of renting the film.

The Shawshank Redemption comes from a Stephen King story and has elements that might remind one of Stalag 17 or Cool Hand Luke. But this movie is an original gem. It is a tribute to man's indomitable spirit. And it shows the importance of hope--even in the lives of men who have been institutionalized by an uncaring society via the prison system.

Two things that make this film greater than others in the genre are:

1. A villain that personifies evil so completely. The warden is made more villainous by his avowed dedication to Christian principles.

2. The excellent screenplay creates ""mini-mysteries"" throughout by allowing the viewer to consider what happens at certain times, then revealing the unexpected truths. This engages the audience, and creates twists that entertain.

This film deserves the hype it gets.",10
"There's just something about the way this movie is made that makes it a perfect film. Maybe its the dialouge, or the acting, or the music, or the cinematography. Whatever the case may be, the point is this, this film is perfect! Whether your 15 or 80, this movie should deeply movie you. I know that I was when I first saw it. I don't remember the exact age I was when I saw it, but I do remember how much this film made me care about the life I have today.

This Film is a personal favorite of mine, not just because of what a great film it is, but because it's a film my father and I have seen over 200 times together. The film really analyzes the bond between two friends and that's how I see my father and I.

This film is absolutely brilliant. Morgan Freeman's best performance. I think the music and the cinematography go VERY unnoticed in the film, I thought they were both brilliant. This film is perfect in every sense of the word and I believe should've won the Oscar for best picture over 'Forrest Gump'(even though I truly loved this film).

If you haven't already seen 'The Shawshank Redemption' please do yourself a favor, go to your local videostore, spend the seven dollars and watch it. Its worth every penny.

This film is a true American classic.",8
"First, let me preface my review about some observations about how IMDB rates its films. The ratings are obviously based on the popularity of films from the perspective of young adults. Older adults would never this film the best of all time; not even close. Well over 9 out of 10 older adults (55 and over) would name a film from the 30s-70s. I have taken the poll myself. I am sure that IMDB is even-handed and fair about these selections, and that they reflect the results of the existing membership, which is increasingly younger year after year.

It would logically follow, then, that the results of these polls would naturally display films seen by IMDB younger members; most, but not all of whom know very little about films from the 30s-70s. It seems a shame that truly great films will be rated lower and lower every year as memberships become younger and younger. Hopefully, some mechanism in the future will allow IMDB have a more accurate description of the top 250 films of all time. Of course, it is only natural that some films from the 1990s to the present time will eventually have to displace previous classics from the 30s-70s. However, when we are talking about the top ten films of all time or so, one must use a great deal of caution before lowering any of them in favor of a newly made film.

Now to The Shawshank Redemption. It is a wonderfully made film that has great emotional range, especially from its leading actor, Tim Robbins, who does a magnificent job. He is ably assisted by Morgan Freeman and the fine direction of Frank Darabont. The cinematography is highly atmospheric, and the music is well-suited to each scene. This story of an accused murderer, who is innocent, but tries to turn his life around is inspiring, but is it the best film of all time? Only time will tell. It is possible that fifty years from now, this film will disappear from the top ten or twenty films rated on IMDB, and will be replaced by film favorites of that current younger population. Those films, no doubt, will appear to be juvenile to the the current crop of critics who believe this film, and other films of the 90s-20s deserve to replace the films of the 30s-70s.",10
"This film tells the story of a banker who is arrested for a crime he did't commit and sent to a prison where he tries to adapt, despite the hardness of the day-to-day life. Based on a Stephen Kink's novel and directed by Frank Darabont, has an excellent cast headed by Tim Robbins, who plays the banker, and Morgan Freeman, who gives life to an inmate, particularly skilled in the art of smuggling goods inside the prison.

Darabont deserves congratulations for the way he directed the film and wrote the screenplay. Thanks to him, this film is human and sentimental without exaggeration. Tim Robbins shone in its interpretation of banker Andrew Dufresne, a man shaken by the sudden collapse of his way of life, but that doesn't cease to dream with freedom and to help those who share his misfortune, even in the worst moments. Thanks to Robbins, Andrew Dufresne isn't a mere banker betrayed by fate, but a deeply generous and human person. Far from spending time lamenting his injustice or his downfall, this Dufresne is more concerned to adapt to his new situation and provide to his cell mates the means to ""trick the bad luck"" and maintain their hope, that same hope that he, himself, always tries to maintain. Another actor that deserves particular attention is Morgan Freeman, who incorporates ""Red"" Redding, a longtime inmate, admittedly guilty, that recounts the events in the first person. Bob Gunton gives body to the prison director who, with the Bible in his hand, will not hesitate to do all the things the Bible disapproves. However, despite the deserved highlights, it must be said that the entire cast of the film deserves congratulations and reached excellence. The technical aspects of the film are equally blameless, with photography and soundtrack to deserve particular attention and to strengthen the human side of this story where, despite the windows have bars, there is always a sun cross for them.

It's not by chance or by grace that this film is considered by many one of the best films ever. In fact, it won this award by right, among other distinctions achieved (seven nominations for the Oscar, two Golden Globe nominations etc...). Acclaimed by the critics, it was a relative commercial failure, which only prove to us that what is done to sell rarely is good enough to stay for posterity. And this movie stays here for the future generations. It's a hymn to hope, and to all human values that we, so often, forget.",10
"This is a story that keeps on giving right to the end and it is delivered by Robbins and Freeman.

Considering the movie takes place in a prison or perhaps because it does, it is an incredibly uplifting tale of hope, survival and a never give up attitude.

The story as great as it is does come second to the performances of the 2 leads. They create a connection between each other and then the audience that entices you in and holds you close as a viewer.

If Shawshank does one thing it makes you wish that more movies could be made like it.",9
"The GMOAT?????? LMAO Prison dramas are a dime a dozen what makes this different from any other prison drama?

It is unoriginal and cliched.

And I dont like Stephen King.

He wrote a horrible little story called IT.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption, one of the rare works of Stephen King that does not contain horror elements, has always been the subject of discussion in cinema conversations. Some say it's the best movie ever, while others think it's the most over-rated movie ever.. I think it's one of the best movies ever.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption really deserves the number one spot here on IMDb Top 250. This movie is so powerful and has to be in the top five best movies I have ever seen. This and Schindler's List were two movies I have seen in the past few days for the first time. I should have watched them eons ago.

This is about some guy who is wrongfully sent to prison for the murders of his ex wife and her lover. While at prison, he befriends a black prisoner who's been there forever. While their friendship lasts, he makes changes to the prison society.

The acting is powerful. The chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is just marvelous. Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor of all time and I'm starting to like Tim Robbins more and more.

I can't believe this movie didn't take home any Oscars. I thought Forrest Gump is a very good movie and I haven't seen Pulp Fiction yet but this movie beats them all.

Overall, this is a fantastic film. I was moved by the characters. This movie also have several twists so beware of that. I rate this movie 10/10.",8
"Just another review on how good this movie is. The development of the ""mystery-scam"" was amazing and the plot twists the best in all film land. Performances on point, clever script and well executed story. A must see!!",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a very emotional movie. It takes its time telling its story but it doesn't feel long. It is a great looking movie with a terrific cast. The cast all deliver top-notch performances, especially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The last forty minutes of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are classic. Writer/director Frank Darabont does a great job mixing violence, cruelty and humanity into a very satisfying watch.",9
I'm 12 years old (don't tell my parents) and even though it doesn't have a full storyline and it's a bit long but I didn't get bored one bit. Great acting and great story. It should of won best picture.,10
"Many believe that the IMDb Top 250 list is quite bad and unrealistic. I partially agree. The trouble is that cult classics, that have passed the test of time, are mixed with the latest blockbusters that enjoy enormous but only temporary popularity. Many of these films have a high rating due to strong marketing and internet hype, and will disappear altogether within a few months or maybe a few years, but I think that the positions of the films that have been on the list for more than a decade, with little variation or without any, pretty much reflect their real quality. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" deserves the first place it holds.

To me, this movie is just perfect. Great camera, masterful directing, a pace that makes two and a half hours simply fly by, top actors and their performances, well-integrated music, and most importantly Darabont's excellent adaptation of the King's story, make this film a timeless masterpiece. This prison story found the perfect balance between drama and humor, sadness and joy, alienation and friendship, malice and empathy, terror and hope. It can be viewed as an interesting adventure with a great plot twist, but also as a metaphor for life in general. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was nominated for seven Oscars, it is at or near the top of almost every list of best films of all time, it's Freeman's favorite own film, King's favorite adaptation of his own story, by far the best adaptation of King and, if not the best, certainly one of the best movies of all time. I saw it several times and not once have I been able to write about it right after watching. It simply leaves me speechless every single time.

10/10",10
"This movie, which I have seen at least 15 times, is my pick for the best movie of the past 20 years and certainly among my Top 10 Films of all time. It was a wonderful story with one of the best endings I've ever experienced in a film. Morgan Freeman fully deserved his Oscar nomination but, conversely, Tim Robbins was robbed of his. His portrayal of Andy DuFresne, a convict lifer wrongfully convicted of killing his wife, was nothing short of amazing. How the academy could have overlooked him in their voting is beyond me and everyone else I know that has seen the film. This is the only film for which I have never heard a bad comment and it got rave reviews from everyone I told to see it. If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, you've missed one of the most wonderful and powerful films of all time. See it today! You'll thank me.",10
This is a great movie. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. It is kind of scary at time. It is a great movie. See it. It is one of the best movies ever. There no reason not to like movie. It is a great movie.,10
"Beautiful film about captivity and hope that helps you survive, this movie is very hard and raw and hard and for this you stick to the screenfrom the beginning at the end, it's impossible to get bored, and the ending is fantastic ande is the fantastic conclusion of a very deep movie.",10
This movie is not made this is crafted and it is so much beautifully crafted that you feel mesmerising after seeing it. Entire movie will keep you spellbound. There is no doubt why the movie tops the chart in IMDb. For me this is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Beauty redefined.,10

"This is a movie that I remember watching before realizing it was based on a Stephen King novella. Part of the reason I saw it was this movie was always on. It is an easy one to jump into at any point and is just good. Jaime and I watched with along with her dad as a movie to end the night as all of us enjoy it. It also was on the Internet Movie Database poster we're working through. I also got the 4K for Christmas and wanted to watch that as well.

What we get here is a heartbreaking tale that has good social commentary. We follow Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) as he comes to stay at Shawshank prison. He claims to be innocent but was convicted of murdering his wife. It is there he befriends Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman) along with his friends. We get to see how these people navigate the prison system and the guards to get better treatment as well as to survive.

The commentary I'm referring to is corruption. We have Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) who uses Andy to launder money. There is Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) who is an enforcer with a short temper. We get to see men raping other men through Bogs Diamond (Mark Rolston) and his crew known as the sisters. There are also the dangers of institutionalization through Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) and Red. I don't want the idea of commentary to steer you away if you haven't seen this. We get to see all this in a subtle way that I give credit to writer/director Frank Darabont.

I can see why this is number one as one of the greatest movies of all time. We have a great cast of stars and character actors. They all bring their characters to life. This movie feels like the different eras of seeing these prisoners who are in for a long time. The cinematography is also great. I love the subtle effects when prisoners are beaten and seeing how those in power abuse that as well. The soundtrack is also well done on top of that.

This is an excellent movie. It is long, but it doesn't feel like it. I highly recommend seeing this one.

My Rating: 9 out of 10.",8
"I saw this for the first time and, to be honest, I was quite amused, especially by the third act. At first, I thought this would be a straight cut drama about human emotions like resilience, perseverance, and hope and nothing else but I was wrong!

While it did explore all those themes, what I did not expect was to witness a momentous finale that would keep me on my toes until the final frame. I did not (at all) expect the film to go down 'that' particular route, so when it did, I was taken aback, or should I say pleasantly surprised!

Now, as far as the movie itself is concerned, it's not the greatest thing ever made, and I will not pretend or sing false praises just to 'fit in', but I'll say this: it is a well-written, well-acted plot that would undoubtedly appeal to a wider spectrum of audience. I can see why this has gotten so much attention and love from people all over the globe; the story has this universal essence that anyone can comprehend, that's the real beauty of it.",9
"I watched this film two times. I liked the idea that Andy Dufresne story is the one that impacts Red to change. I find the narration very much needed in the story, and this story is to me about hope and finding your way into leaving a mark on this planet.",8
"Very very weak. There is practically nothing in the entire film that surprises us in any way. If the purpose of the film was to be edifying, frankly, I saw nothing useful, neither moral nor spiritual. And it's not because I'm hard at heart; on the contrary, I have a good heart and high conservative moral values. But I finished watching this movie and I felt me depressed and upset by the waste of my time. In fact, I already got used to not giving credit to the high ratings of IMDb users.",10
"A lesson of life. An extraordinary piece of film making that could relate to life itself.

This is along with ""The Godfather"" the most influential movie of all time because it gives Hollywood a good name. I mean, it displays the best of it through memorable acting, marvelous direction, extraordinary art direction and cinematography, and best of all; it achieves to deliver a message that may sound a cliché but ends up being a vital part of life, you know it deals with ""Hope"". Sure, this is the anti thesis of ""The Godfather"" in terms of the good characters always ""win"", or the positive message, but that's another story.

The pace of the movie is perfect because it gives it's time to explain the events at it's full expression and through little details we fully get into the world of Shawshank and we get to know perfectly the principal inmates of it. Andy Dufrense is played brilliantly by Tim Robbins who deserved an Oscar nod for his display of intelligence, desperation, cold blood when needed and best of all, hope. But Morgan Freeman steals the show as a character came from Heaven. He truly inspires all the possible feelings to the audience. One of the all time best performances. Clancy Brown also delivers s fantastic performance as the creepy and cold blooded guardian. He's the man! The events of the movie will get the best of you if you give them the chance. You will feel happiness, hope, anger, sadness, and even you will have the time to reflex for some specific moments.

Death is seen as a new way of watching things here. Through Brooks demise we learn that he was institutional, I mean, his life was prison.

But as it's a big budget film, it has to deal with the obligatory Hollywood situations such as the tender Jake sub-plot, the necessary violent sequences, and the message it gives to the audience.

I don't like poems that much but this movie is the closest thing to film poetry. When art mixes correctly with talent and big resources such as money, great things can happen and this beautiful movie is the prime example.

Friendship is displayed as one of the most important things in the world. But you will find more values such as redemption, justice, tenderness, and being grateful. The ending always makes me wanna cry, but I play the strong guy ;)

Please watch this movie in order to witness one of the best movies of all time, if not one of the top 3.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is something of an oddity. Based on a Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, it has dominated IMDb's Top 250 list for years now and has often been regarded as one of the best films ever made. Almost every adult Westerner has seen the movie at some point during their lives, yet not all that many people talk about this film, at least in my experience. It's not often recommended to others like The Godfathers, it's not quoted as often as The Dark Knight or Fight Club, it's not regarded as inherently cool as Pulp Fiction. So what makes it so great then? In my opinion the answer lies in its quality as a whole. It's not a flashy film. The pacing is slow as time itself - fitting for a prison film, admittedly - the conversations are often quiet and thoughtful, the prison setting never changes, but rather builds up in intensity and while there are emotions and deep themes displayed, they're not over the top or hammered in. Rather they're subtle, real if you will.

It's not a film that you will talk about a lot, but it's a movie that will stick with you. It's not a film that will leave you puzzled for days as you try to work through it's meanings, it's not a hard movie to understand, but you'll find yourself returning to it from time to time. And there are a lot of things to return to. The quiet dignity of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the friendship between him and Red (Morgan Freeman), the other inmates, the brutality of the warden and the guards, that brilliant moment in the rain, the ending, the callbacks, the overarching and complex plot.

The Shawshank Redemption is the jack of all trades of films. Not a single element in it is the absolute best within cinema, but they're all way above average. Everything from the slightest camera angle to the main actors is up to par and beyond. Personally it's not my favourite movie of all time, I admit as much, but it's a masterpiece in its own right. I have nothing against it being the number one.",9
"Beginning in the late 1940s comes this gripping, poignant, one of a kind prison saga from director Frank Darabont. Freeman is brilliant as a slick but cynical inmate who's spent most of his life within the cruel prison system of Shawshank; Robbins is riveting as a hotshot Maine banker-turned-new inmate with whom he forms an unbreakable bond, and comes to admire for his will, determination, and endless grasp of hope that allows him to transcend the boundaries of his turbulent surroundings. Their deep, emotional bond is the focus of this long, arduous, and compelling journey that showcases friendship and the sheer power of the human spirit unlike any other film of its time. This remarkable, in-depth, allegorical and unforgettable story will certainly be remembered for years to come. ****",10
"I never wrote a review before. I will try to write more often.

But this film is so good that you have to write something about it.

"This film is quite simply fantastic, great performances, great storyline, well directed and produced, my favourite film ever.",8
One word amazing! so so so great love this cant wait for more,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a great film, because it's a touching story about the life in a terrible jail.Andy Dufresne has been accused of the murder of his wife and her lover and has been sentenced to 20 years of jail altough he was innocent.Then begins his slow adaptation to this new and hard world.But he will meet Red, a very quiet and clevar prisoner and begins a new friendship which will help them to survive in this universe.With a lot of patience and intelligence Andy will prepare his escape. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are really extraordinary actors: they give to the film a great strength, dramatism and suspense.",10
"Now this is why we go to movies. I'm surprised at how this film flopped when it was first released in 1994 and yet 11 years later, it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I think it's the greatest movie of all time (sorry, to all of those who think that title goes to ""The Godfather""). Yet, here is a movie that in all instances should have failed. Maybe it was because of the plot, which shared too many likenesses to every cliché prison drama we've ever seen. But I assure you, that's not what goes on here. Directed by Frank Darabont, who wrote the film's script, which is an adaptation of the Stephen King short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is filled with a strong sense of self-worth and purpose. Yes, in the beginning a man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for a murder he did not commit. Behind the walls of Shawshank penitentiary, Andy finds himself the victim (a ""fish"" - prison slang for a new arrival) of violent acts by other hardcore convicts. He begins a tentative friendship with a fellow lifer, Red (Morgan Freeman, in an Oscar-nominated role), and Andy finds himself doing the taxes of the warden (Bob Gunton). In all of this, we know that a man, like Andy, is not meant to be locked up, whether he committed a heinous crime or not because simply, the human spirit is not meant to kept down by mortal circumstances. This lends a great amount of weight and structure to the film's most powerful image, which has ingrained itself indelibly into our minds. This movie carefully avoids clichés, and it's the better for it. Tim Robbins is a revelation in this movie, as is Morgan Freeman and the rest of the supporting players. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film about hope in even the most bleak of places, which could be considered prison. It's a movie that has rightfully earned a place in cinematic history as a legend and a masterpiece of film. It's no wonder why.

10/10",10
"Frank Darabont is mostly known for ""The Shawshank redemption"" (1994) and ""The green mile"" (1999). Both prison films and both based on a Stephen King novel.

Usually I am not a great fan of prison movies, especially when they involve escape attempts (as ""The Shawshank redemption"" does). The only exception (until watching ""The Shawshank redemption"") was ""Le trou"" (1960, Jacques Becker).

But despite the escape ""The Shawshank redemption"" does not glorify prison life. It is more of a character study than an action movie. The central characters are Andy (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman), between whom a close friendship grows.

I shall not take a closer look at this friendship in this review. That would reveal too much about the plotline. As important is in my opinion the way the film illustrates every day prison life. I have selected three examples.

The film emhasizes that every day prison life is very monotonous. To illustratie time gradually passing the pin ups on the walls evolve from Rita Hayworth via Marilyn Monroe to Raquel Welch.

The film emphasizes that prison life can be very hard. It is the survival of the fittest. The inhabitants of the Shawshank state prison are not petty thieves after all. When Andy arrives the inmates already present yell: ""fresh fish, fresh fish"". That the inmates may not be petty thieves but are no barbarians either is illustrated in a (beautiful) scene where Andy has the opportunity to play classical music in the directors office and disseminate this music through the sound system across the prison courtyard.

With respect to the purpose of prisons there are two views. In one view prisons are an organised way in which society takes revenge on criminals. In the other view prisons also have the purpose (task) to prepare the inmates for their return in civil society. The character of Brooks Hatlan (James Whitmore) illustrates that the Shawshank state prison falls short in the last mentioned task. In prison he is the librarion, which gives meaning to his life. When released he is nobody. Having forgotten everything about living outside the prison we see him scared to death while riding in a streetcar.",10
"There are a select group of films that have achieved the feat of being received with unanimous enthusiasm by both critics and audiences and still having survived the unforgivable test of time virtually intact. This is exactly the case of The Shawshank Redemption, one of the most celebrated films of 1994 and which has already established itself as a classic widely present in the popular imagination. The film directed by Frank Darabont (a feature debutant at the time) reached the position it occupies precisely because it perfectly executes the formula of the redemption drama.

Darabont captures the spirit of the works like few others, bringing to the big screen not a transposition identical to the original material, but a reading that matches the source of inspiration. This ability can be seen in ""The Mist"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"", films that show how the master of horror also has a talent for dramatic stories. In the production in question, the drama emerges from a man's struggle against the physical and symbolic prisons that arise around him and within him.

In the book, successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover and taken to Shawshank Penitentiary in Maine. His pity: life imprisonment in a place that is a prisoner's nightmare. The routine is terrible because of the cruelty of the director and the guards, but it can also offer friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who leads one of the prison's groups and clandestinely arranges objects requested by colleagues.

The evils of incarceration are quickly identified as obstacles to the full freedom of Andy and the others. Isolation from society, severe punishments represented by long sentences or life imprisonment and the confinement guaranteed by walls, fences and guards are enough to express the adversity of prisoners. However, the film goes further and also exposes the authoritarianism of director Warden (Bob Gunton), when he presents to new inmates as an administrator attached to discipline and his own understanding of the Bible, and the truculence of guard Hadley (Clancy Brown), when he beats up a newcomer for crying at night in his cell. Characters and spectators not only feel intimidated, but also feel the threat of Shawshank in the aerial shots of the courtyard and in the magnifying counter-plongée of the place during the protagonist's arrival.

In addition to authority figures, the penitentiary's residents themselves also pose some sort of threat. The habit of older prisoners to provoke the new ones increases the situation of tension that already exists, as can be seen in the sequence in which they bet on who would be the first to give in to the pressures of the first night. In the same vein, the tradition of forming different groups that protect their members and intimidate or attack other detainees is another practice carried out by convicts that destabilize the confinement. Anyone who doesn't fit into one of the groups eventually runs into serious problems - that's what happens to Andy, initially a loner raped by the homosexual group, until he approaches Red and becomes part of his group.

Shawshank still affects those serving their time in an unconscious, intimate dimension. A long period of imprisonment makes men experience and naturalize a routine that gives some regularity, some certainty to their lives (even if it is bad and adverse): they spend a lot of time in their cells, sunbathe, interact with other prisoners, they eat in the dining halls and face the authorities of the place. Being incarcerated for a long time and consolidating this routine as a habit creates what Red calls an ""institutionalized"" prisoner, that is, someone who would not survive outside prison because he could not adapt to an environment of freedom. Brooks and Red synthesize the feelings of an ex-convict who regains his freedom, but no longer recognizes the outside world or knows how to act in it - hence, an emptiness that makes them prefer the familiarity that prison awakens.

The portrayal of the daily lives of the condemned is carried out in a very coherent way. Darabont seeks simplicity. As in the best films of Clint Eastwood's career, the director of A Dream Freed chooses an almost invisible direction: all his artistic choices privilege the narrative. In addition, he is not afraid to abuse the feature that in writers' jargon is known as ""hook"". Almost all the elements of the film (Andy's profession, the setting, the objects, small phrases, the secondary characters, etc.) are taken up and reused, with minor changes, for an intensification of the effects. One of the criticisms of using so many hooks is that they make the narrative too obvious, diminishing its originality and complexity. However, what some see as obvious (due to the excess of the same resource) can, on the other hand, be seen as a strong factor of coherence. In my view, Darabont knew how to propose and explore patterns in a way that allowed him to extract the maximum amount of meaning they could offer.

The Shawshank Redemption shows the value of freedom, of finding your place in the world, and of real friendship. These are concepts very well worked out by Frank Darabont in his script, put to the test in emotional performances. Even if, at times, the film lacks the narration, much of the relationship between those men in prison is built on silence. The protagonist may be the best example of this, as he is not a talkative person. He tries to stay sane in an unknown world. And, at first, stillness and discretion are his greatest allies. Tim Robbins brings Andy Dufresne to life as a strong-willed person who uses his wits to get what he wants. As much as he is friends with fellow prisoners, he does not allow anyone to know the full extent of his goals. He thinks of the common good, but he has an agenda of his own to fulfill. Morgan Freeman, in turn, makes Red a pleasant-spoken guy who is very sure of his certainties, won over by Andy's temperament and personality. The actors do not hide that there is a love story there, although made by two heterosexual men. This feeling helps both to resist unfavorable situations, such as the constant refusal of parole or the increasing periods of solitary confinement that Andy goes through when defying his superiors.

Frank Darabont builds a believable universe, in which ""everyone is innocent"". Prisoners see their situation through reality and, for them, no one is guilty of the crimes for which they were convicted. The ethics and coexistence of those men is exciting and shows that humanity can exist even among people confined in a prison, deprived of the most valuable right that is freedom. No wonder, the film's most detestable villains are not behind bars, but running the situation, as is the case of director Norton and jailer Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). We are, after all, seeing the story through the eyes of Red, the narrator of the plot.

The most interesting thing about Frank Darabont's work is to note that it examines several ways out of the extreme reality in which its prisoners live, physically, emotionally and even sexually abused by the guards and the inhuman and despotic director. There is resignation, experienced in an automated way by Freeman's character and which he himself will understand as an unfeasible path in a long dialogue with his best friend after Brooks' death. There is the capitulation and denial of life as action and freedom, which Whitmore's character represents by not being able to survive after getting out of prison. Curious that he calls the prison his ""home"", recognizing himself no longer as a man, but only as a prisoner dependent on his nutshell. Is this not the deepest stage of Sartrean bad faith? A Freedom Dream puts its finger on the wound without mercy - suffering can become the most powerful comfort zone as it denies man himself as responsible for his history. The third outlet for man immersed in such a thorny reality is hope. Put that way, it might sound silly. But the narrative rhythm of the film, with its direction and script that do not hasten the protagonist's evolution, allows us to understand how laborious it is to preserve it in the face of an existence that lashes us not once or twice, but hundreds of times.

The film's most iconic still, in which Andy is captured in one of the most recognizable plongée in film history, celebrates the victory of hope in a world that seems to hold none. The character does not earn his freedom in a heroic or glorious way. He reaches it by dragging himself over filth and degradation. This scene throws the lime shovel, once and for all, on the possibility that this was yet another great movie, losing itself in an ending with an easy appeal. A closer look should also understand that here the process also matters a lot. The Shawshank Redemption offers us some tools to face existence. Noble feelings such as friendship and faculties as valuable as human intelligence and creativity, with which Andy moves his companions out of their comfort zones and promotes improvements in his prison life, seem to work as powerful stratagems to preserve the expectation of redemption.

Never sounding appealing, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a beautiful cinematic experience about man's struggle for hope and freedom, even amidst the injustices and oppression of the prison system. As powerful as it is, the film doesn't need to use fantastic elements, in the supernatural sense, to be called fantastic. He is like that thanks to the excellence he carries in his humanity.",10
"I absolutely dare any critic, movie buff, casual movie watcher or ANYBODY with a pulse to be able to watch both shawshank redemption and green mile and not admit that Stephen king is a true master story teller!! He is right up there with the greats William Shakespeare, Mark Twain, Hemingway, Tolkien,etc. And I have to also include Darabont has a true genius as well. It's rare you can get a TRUE 10 in a movie rating let alone 2!! But both are MASTERPIECES and examples of perfect flawless films!! All I can say is thank you for the Absolute legal steal of 10.00 on Amazon I purchased BOTH movies that I will watch until the bluray wears out, THANK YOU UNIVERSE!!!!!! Oh I almost forgot, WATCH this movie NOW!! Just in case you've been on a deserted island.",10
Good and Motivational story telling. Performances are good and characters are portrayed very well.,7
"¨Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies. ¨ An uplifting and inspiring movie that reminds us that hope is what keeps us going during difficult situations. The movie ranks at number one in the top IMDb list and it comes as no surprise because many people rank this movie among their all-time favorite. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give an excellent performance in this film directed by Frank Darabont and which is based on Stephen King's short story ¨Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.¨ It received 7 Oscar nominations in 1995 including Best Picture, but lost to Forrest Gump. Freeman is probably the best actor when it comes to narrating a story and this is one of his greatest roles as he introduces us to Robbins's character, Andy Dufresne. Andy is a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to prison for life. In Shawshank prison Andy befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) who serves as the provider in jail because he can get just about anything you ask, yes even Rita Hayworth. The prison is run by Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) with a stern hand, and the prison guards treat the prisoners very violently. Despite how unjust life has been towards Andy he never losses hope because as he puts it ¨You either get busy living or you get busy dying.¨ There is a very positive message we can learn from this movie and if you are among the few that haven't seen it yet then I absolutely recommend this as a must see film! You won't regret it.

"There are not many movies that can touch me emotionally. Few movies have done this and those movies are: The green mile, The gladiator, Crash and Shawshank redemption.

This movie makes you feel like you have known the persons in the movie all your life. It lets you understand them and love them. It shows you what true friendship is and that how dark things look there is always a light at the end and that things don't always go like you want it them and that you should do your best making the best of all situations. Like i have said one of the best movies i have ever seen, not a doubt in my mind giving it 10 stars. Gordon Freemans voice is a pleasure hearing and makes you really listen to the story.

For you people that haven't seen the movie yet its about a young man that is a banker. Hes wife cheats on him and he gets convicted of murdering her and her lover. This young man gets to the prison ""Shawshank"" and has a rough time. Paying his sentence he starts to make friends and some of them are powerful. This gets him in trouble but he is always one step ahead of his powerful friends that become enemies that get him in trouble making life impossible for him. At last he makes it and everything goes as planed.

Sorry if my short version of the movie is a bit diffuse but this movie is too good to spoil even a little bit.

I know you will like it as much as i did.",8
"Just a comment about something that I didn't see anyone else mention recently. (I didn't read all nine billion comments on this movie) I thought that the character ""Red"" was a white man in King's story. Now, there's nothing wrong with casting Morgan Freeman in that part, and he was great in it. (He was cast as President of the United States in ""Deep Impact"" and carried that off very well. I thought it was kind of neat to cast a black actor as President and make absolutely no reference to his race throughout the movie. Would that we could be that way in reality.) But TSR was set in a particular time, (1947-1968) and I find it hard to believe that there was utterly no racism in a Maine prison in those days. Sort of undercuts the realism that seemed to be done so well in every other aspect of the movie. Just a minor quibble. Everything else I have to say about TSR has already been said. Grade: A+",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the greatest films ever made. We see the survival of an innocent prisoner over a period of time who survives with the power of hope. From the effortless acting, a near perfect story, great filming and symbolism this film is a treasure and hits it out of the park.

The filming techniques used were masterful. Darabont uses various camera angles and shots to give an image of an institution and explore one of the themes of institutionalism. Andy uses hope to free himself, the pickaxe is a symbol of that hope and the projects such as the library are the ways he sustains himself. In some ways he makes prison life more humane by getting beers for his inmates and playing Mozart for the prison in iconic shot showing the inmates stunned when they hear it. Although we see him escape in an iconic scene we have to understand that he had freed himself and even if he spent time in the hole he was not institutionalised. However Brooks was not able to overcome this and could not survive life outside the institution and its rules, it had consumed him. We have seen this theme in other films where just like it got the better of Brooks it got the better of McMurphy in One flew over the cuckoo's nest. We see and feel the overpowering and grey on grey prison. One of the most beautiful moments in the film and probably film history is Andy's statement that he had to come to prison to become a crook. The corruption within the large prison walls is carefully explored by Darabont.

The only tragedy is that this film won 0 Oscars. A film with a plot that was flawless and stood the test of time. A film that was ahead of its time. At least the other biggest Oscar snub in history which occurred for Goodfellas at least resulted in one Oscar being claimed by the film. The Shawshank Redemption deserved to clean up at the Oscars.",10
"Few movies can grab the soul like this one. For me, every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption, I remember the music. I remember the framing, how each scene is perfectly constructed and put together, displaying the lives of the criminals. Every oily moment with the warden, every frightening vision with the `Sisters,' and of course, every point of pontification by the venerable Andy Dufresne. While I do not consider this the greatest movie ever, it is awfully close o the top.

The performances by the likes of Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown (who was doing Dr. Pepper commercials at the time) and Bob Gunton as Warden Norton were all exceptional. One thing that always keeps me coming back is the score by Thomas Newman. While he has based his entire style off this memorable score (listen to The Road to Perdition and Shawshank back to back, and you'll see), the subtle movements and piano keys turn this into one of the best films of all time.",10
"Rarely has a director connected so well to the spirit of a story, and with the impeccable work of Morgan Freeman, whose narration is nothing short of perfect, and Tim Robbins' everyman, ""Shawshank"" delivers an almost perfect film. Frank Darabont has opened up the short story and created a work that explores what lurks in the souls of people. He has added details that allow us to understand how the human spirit manages to survive in the worst of conditions. He also shows us that beauty lies in just about any place in this world.

The film moves very well, taking us for a long and rewarding ride. Characters age and evolve, discovering how their relationships with others always have consequences. Tim Robbins remains at the center, and he becomes, for most of the film, an observer, our representative in a world that could destroy you if you let it.

We relate to the men of ""Shawshank"" because they are our representatives in a microcosm of society. We observe as we participate and see our reflections in a mini study of emotions and mind games.",10
"One of the best movies of all time. They simply do not make movies like this anymore. Top notch cast, story, and pace.",9
"In our culture today, action films have become the (unfortunate) standard. The Shawshank Redemption defies that standard to the last moment. Not an action scene to be seen, yet it still holds just about any audience captive (excuse the pun).

With a great deal of (at times, preachy but) never dull dialogue, excellent characters, remarkable situations and one of the finest, most dramatic scores ever written, this film manages to inspire and uplift just about any viewer.

Personally, next to the ""The Godfather"", this is the perfect film. Some could even justify it as the most perfect film of all time, and I would be unable to argue that even, for I fail to see it becoming dated or irrelevant.

And on a closing note, Frank Darabont is the genius behind this screenplay (which was, of course based on a Stephen King short). But Mr. Darabont is also one of the writers behind the far inferior sequel to ""The Fly"", known as ""The Fly II"" and ""Nightmare On Elm Street III"". So, I guess if he can bring to life this film, anyone who believes in their project enough could also have a shot.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption movie is one of the greatest films in history ever.

The movies that were called the dark horse of the industry were unexpected and impressive movies that will stick in your mind for a long time. A drama film called Shawshank Redemption is the story of a banker, Andy Dufresne, who was caught up in the murder of his wife and her adultery then. Their story is about the rest of his life in the Shawshank prison, the friendship, and the pain of reality. One of the most interesting parts of this movie is that it is told from a third-person point of view, which gives a new perspective by using an indirect approach. It depicts a lot of inequity in prison life, but the focus point in this movie is hope. The hope that could rarely be found in a place that was called ""hopeless,"" such as prison, is the reason why the movie wants to show freedom in ways that people could never have imagined that people in prison would still have hope. This is not the normal prison film that audiences expect about jailbreak, but this movie leads to a different feeling. It's gained emotion through the situation that the characters have been through, and even more emotion is gained by the impressive ending. The movie always showed you some phases that demonstrated the truth of being human; that will definitely hit you. You will be able to relate a scenario, a character, or a situation in this simple movie to something deeply personal in your own life after experiencing it. This kind of movie is great to keep watching more than once because your thoughts and perspective on it will change as you grow up.",8
"This is the best prison movie there is by far, but it's a lot more than that. Concepts like institutionalization being portrayed and taught, relationships between characters, and ground-breaking scenes with great directing/cinematography, memorable lines, this movie has all of it for sure! While it's not my personal favorite movie of all time, I can definitely see why this is rated number one!",9
"""The Shawshank Redemption is a truly solid film with a touching story, dark, sad, brutal, depressing, and inspiring, terrific perfomance by all the cast and incredible story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is not only tells a story about a man in prison but also tells a story about a man with a great lesson that we as an audience can take and learn, overall The Shawshank Redemption is simply one of the greatest film i've ever watch, i highly recommended""",8
"What an experience. Because that's what this is, more of an experience than a film. Just sensational in so many ways. So visceral, real, emotional, rewarding. Shawshank has it all. The cast, the story, the set, costume, direction, script, soundtrack... everything was sublime. Numerous touching moments, comedic moments, dramatic moments, sombre moments and heart warming moments combine to make this a goliath of film making.

The entire cast were great, not a single dud performance, but the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were stellar. Robbins as Andy Dufresne gave such a powerful, varied and nuanced performance. As soon as I'd finished watching I wanted to dive straight into a second viewing to appreciate it one more time. Freeman as well was superb, tying the film together so perfectly with his narration and overall presence.

What I really loved about Shawshank was how it didn't dwell on the crimes of the men, but treated them as very real and human people. Despite being set in a prison this wasn't a film about crime and punishment, but about life and hope. It was because of this that the film has so much heart. Sombre, yes, often bleak, but always with a vein of hope running through it.

The way that prison life was presented felt quite real and gritty. The costume, set design, and sinister portrayals of Warden Norton and Captain Hadley brought the film to life, creating a dangerous and brutal atmosphere for proceedings.

What Shawshank also did very well was transcend time so effortlessly and effectively. As mentioned earlier, this film managed to feel like an epic novel crammed into two hours twenty minutes. There is so much to digest and pick through, yet that time manages to absolutely fly by.

Intricate. Detailed. Rich. Rewarding. The Shawshank Redemption most definitely earns its position at the top of IMDb's highest rated films list.",8
"Stephen King's written so many stories you'd be surprised that the most well-received adaptation of his work is not a horror story; it's a very believably personal story about hope and how it drives us through the very darkest times ones can have in prison: especially when you're convicted of a crime you did not commit in the first place. I don't know where in Stephen King's mind this story came from but it's certainly one of his best, if not his finest.

The Shawshank Redemption may baffle some for its high rating on IMDb: all this rating stuff is subjective anyway. And in my subjective view The Shawshank Redemption has become a classic for a reason; it's finely cast, very well written and directed: Frank Darabont must LOVE his Stephen King considering this one of a few works he's done based on King's stories. And Shawshank is quite easily the cream of the crop for both people's works.

If Back to the Future was essential viewing for the 80s from the 80s, the same thing applies to Shawshank for the 90s. Give it a watch if you haven't already.",10
"Amazing from start to finish. If you haven't seen this movie yet, please stop what you're doing, and watch!",9
"The plot and the sub plots are good but not great, which sums up most of the movie. Many of the characters are very one-dimensional, such as the Guard Captain, whose only characteristic is that he takes any chance he gets to abuse prisoners. The acting in the film is nothing special except for Bill Bolender who does a fantastic job in the few seconds he gets to play Elmo Blatch.

What bothered me a lot and what makes the film noticeably worse than it could've been is Morgan Freeman's narration that spoon feeds the viewer with information that should've been communicated with the shots shown during the narration. Without the narration, the viewers would have been forced to focus on the actions, facial expressions and body language of the different characters to understand what they are going through. There is a reason to why Harrison Ford's narration in the original version of Blade Runner is excluded in the two later versions. There are many theories surrounding the ending of the movie, but in my opinion these theories only exist because the ending is so boring that people create better endings in their minds to make the disappointing movie they've just seen better. Strong 7/10.",10
One of the few cases of the movie being better than the book in my opinion. An absolute classic that never gets old.,9
"Leaving this review for the checklist thing. Great movie, easily one of the best ever. Certainly the best Stephen King movie.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an academy-award nominated 1994 film starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.It was based on a short novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", which was featured in the collection entitled ""Different Seasons"".This novella collection also includes the novellas which were later made into the movies ""Apt Pupil"" and ""Stand By Me"".Stephen King is actually my favorite author and I really enjoyed the novella.Now for the movie.I watched it a few months ago and I found that it was very good.The acting is superb, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great, the storyline, characters etc were all great.It is a great movie.However it definitely does not deserve to be #1 on IMDb's Top 250 movie list or any top movie list for that matter.I liked the novella a bit more though there were some changes in the film that I liked better.The film is directed by Frank Darabont who would later make the amazing and superior(in my opinion) ""The Green Mile"".Overall, Shawshank is definitely one of the best prison movies of all time, though it is a tad overrated.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the impressive outcome of simple but stunning writing and direction by Frank Darabont combining with the entertaining performances delivered by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Catching, compelling, captivating, and convincing aren't strong enough, although they're only a few of the leading terms to describe this Stephen King adaptation. Readers of the novel will likely appreciate this drama.

What the film's story does best is it features startling twists, dramatic turns and never, ever shies away from shocking its audience with graphic prison beatings and other compelling jail details. Also, the originality of the entire prolonged story is the chief reason to why moviegoers and critics will never forget The Shawshank Redemption. However, those expecting pure Stephen King horror throughout will not get what they predict, as this feature is a drama similar to Stand By Me.

It's also unusual to agree that this film is really uplifting for a Stephen King prison tale. There is a decent handful of phenomenally positive life messages throughout targeting teens and adults, especially at the satisfying ending. But some audiences will definitely feel dissatisfied which you'll mainly understand once you've actually seen the film. Being one of the highest rated films of all time, why not watch it? This prison drama is worth a watch for everyone, despite their favourite genres.

"Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.

I've heard much about this movie. I've heard great things about this movie; wait, scratch that. I've heard brilliant things about this movie (considering that this is #2 on the top 250 list in IMDb). I didn't really expect much from this movie because of the long running time and that this film (I thought) was about redemption. Boy, did it blow me away!

It didn't blow me away as far as people have been blown like a huge tornado have wrecked the country. It had blown me away like a strong wind would've knocked me down. It wasn't all that great (like a masterpiece) but it was an extremely satisfying film.

The performances in here were pretty much rock solid as far as playing two men in jail can go. The score was indeed very pleasing to one's ears. What else to say? Oh, the story may feel dark but there are some points where there are some light-heartedness and comedic scenes.

This film won me over. It pretty much won everyone over with it's great story and heart. Overall, as I said, it was extremely satisfying to watch from beginning to end. It didn't drag a bit even for a two and almost a half hour film. Watch it and you'll be blown away; but not as much as many others have been.",10
"Based on the acclaimed novella by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a film burning with a certain sense of triumph that is rarely experience in any cinematic effort. It is a drama that stops at just about nothing to grab at your heart while feasting it with a strong human touch. This effort is accomplished by director Frank Durabont who, in his directorial debut, grasps on a powerful hold on the spirit of Stephen King's original source material. Taking from the pages of the novella of the same name, the film sets its action inside the walls of the federal penitentiary, a dark place where some of the most innocent people are incarcerated while they hopelessly watch as they are robbed of their humanity at the hands of the unpleasant nature within the prison. While some are thrown in prison for their lack of innocence, others lose their innocence while serving their time within the barbed wire fences and rusty cells. The primary focus of this bleak, yet triumphant tale, however, is the man who vows to fight against this tragedy. Set in 1947, this film follows Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a man sentenced to forty years in prison after wrongly being accused of the murder of his cheating wife and his lover. Stationed at the Shawshank Prison in New England under the watchful eye of religious bible-thumping Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton), Andy is forced to deal with the harsh reality of the prison life, but soon finds a glimmer of hope when he forms a bond with fellow prisoner under the nickname Red (played by Morgan Freeman) who claims to be innocent. Following his years in prison, Andy seeks for redemption and decency among his fellow prisoners while struggling to survive against the unpleasant lifestyle uprooted by Norton.

One thing everyone in that prison has in common is that they are all innocent, at least according to Red in a scene upon meeting Andy for the first time. But does he truly mean? That question lies within the story as it proceeds through a long, yet thoughtful process of establishing the emotional nature of the characters and the soul- crushing environment that has them shaken to their cores. But as Red states, ""you become use to it"". Whether one can agree with Red's claims or not, it is his wisdom that establishes him as a character with an emotional force to reckoned with. And kudos can be given to Frank Durabont's absorbing script, this character would not the shining light he is without the outstanding performance by Morgan Freeman who amplifies the role is just enough emotional magnitude to tap at the heart, while also dominating the film with his narration. The bond between him and Tim Robbins strikes the chord in more ways than one, especially with Robbins embracing the role with pure grit. Andy is a tragic character who is forced to come to terms with the reality that innocence is lost regardless of when it is in your control, and that leaving does not always mark the end of your tragedy. One character in the film is forced to learn that the hard way in one heartbreaking sequence. The film never grabs at your heart with strangling you with forced sentimentality, it just allows its emotions to run wild while sprinkling small bursts of humor to occasionally lighten the tone. In the midst of the melancholy at defines the atmosphere, there is a powerful sense of hope that Andy will not let the prison become the thief of his dignity nor his humanity, particularly at the hands of Bob Gunton's Warden Norton, a corrupt individual tainted with his religious hypocrisy. How can one trust a man who shoves his bible in their face, yet expresses himself in such an inhuman manner? And for a technical standpoint, shout-outs go to Roger Deakins for his profound cinematography to capture the nature of each scene from start to finish.

The Shawshank Redemption is a triumphant cinematic effort brimming with an uncompromising heart and sense of humanity within its roots. It is powerful picture that will leave you heartfelt one moment, then leave you choked up within the next. That is just an example how magnificent director Frank Durabont is at gripping you with such a strong human touch. Worthy of the name ""masterpiece""? I definitely think so.",9
"Interesting study of wrongly-convicted Robbins sent to jail and abused by evil warden and (initially) fellow prisoners. As film develops, Robbins turns tables on everyone. Understated performance by the lead; Morgan Freeman, as a fellow prisoner, actually drives this flick. Didn't see where this differed from half a dozen other good prison movies, but that's why they make all those flavors. Very satisfying resolution.",8
"This was one of those instant classics you will always watch again, and possibly learn new things or notice new things as your experiences in life grow cause we are forever learning new things!!!!",9
I had not seen this film again ever since I first watched it in a movie theater 26 years ago. What a brilliant and outstanding piece of cinematic achievement.,10
"An accountant named Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins is found guilty of murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He is sent to Shawshank prison, a prison run by a God-fearing and a strict warden. Andy meets 'Red' played by Morgan Freeman at Shawshank and the lives of the prisoners and their emotions is captured in the movie in an excellent manner. The premise of the movie looks too simple but there are a very few movies that are as powerful as Shawshank Redemption. You can watch this movie time and again without getting bored. The first time I saw the movie, by the time it was almost coming to an end I felt that it was a pretty good movie and then there was this unexpected and a memorable ending followed by an explanation in Morgan Freeman's deep voice that made the movie simply great. I couldn't help but stand up and clap at the completeness of the movie. It captures every possible human emotion and portrays them every possible way you wanna see it. The movie runs at a pretty good pace, no lags or halts or irrelevant scene added to enhance the effects of the movie, and a simple background score. Or in other words this movie has its own natural flow, nothing in it seems out of place. Add to all this is the fine acting of Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and all the other support crew. This is a classic and not to be missed for any reason whatsoever.",9
"It's nice. It's somewhat clever. Just too formulaic with the ""noble prisoners"" struggling against the corrupt and evil prison system. It would be nice to see a movie that actually thought ILL of prisoners (as we should). Same aul, same aul.",10
"This film has become the film that wins most 'best 100' polls. I don't know why but it does.

However, this is a good movie. From my perspective I think it is liked so much is that the plot is ever changing and moves along at a good pace. The story seems to progress in little chapters and it builds to a wonderful climax. As the movie develops we become engrossed in what will happen next. We do enjoy Andy's victories over the bad guys and we do want to know what happens in the end.

Technically, This is nothing special. There are very few moody shots and angles that challenge the visual senses. Visually I do think this compares to Citizen Cane or Pulp Fiction. But in a way I think that because we are not distracted by fancy pictures we stay with the plot.

Make sure you watch this, even if it is just to see what all the fuss is about.",10
"This film is based on the Stephen King novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", published in 1982. I guess it is fair to say, that over the last 50 years, the feeling on Stephen King film adaptations is about 50/50, great/ok. You have some lame ones like, Children of the Corn (1984), Graveyard Shift (1990) and Lawnmower Man (1992). And, you have the great ones, like The Shining (1980), Stand by Me (1986) and The Green Mile (1999).

Well, this film is arguably the best. It has incredible ratings on all the film websites/apps. It is a critical favorite and most of the audience share loves it. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, but didn't win any. Turns out, 1994 had a lot of stiff competition; Forrest Gump (1994), Ed Wood (1994), Pulp Fiction (1994) and Lion King (1994), just to name a few. Shawshank Redemption (1994), truly is a great piece of film work. It is directed by Frank Darabont. Frank Darabont also directed The Green Mile (1999). He also developed and was Executive Producer on the first season of Walking Dead (2010-2011). He also directed the pilot for that show. His directing credits are actually a little light, so it was nice to see that he put all he could into this film.

This period piece takes us back to the mid-1940s. This film never let's you forget the time period that it happens in, even with four walls as the only real setting of the film. None of that is more evident than when we see over the next 20 years, Andy's decorative pin-up girl posters, he has on the wall, change from era to era.

The film immediately introduces us to our main character. The one that drives the film along and everything happening in the film revolves around him. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), with no defense, is falsely sent to prison for murder. He has to serve two life sentences. Tim Robbins gives a perfect performance, making us second guess his intentions at every turn. He is quiet, but brilliant enough to be respected.

Morgan Freeman's character, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, another inmate in the prison, immediately befriends Andy. As usual Morgan Freeman does what he does best. He is the calming, soothing force around the prison. He is a leader, a friend and a hub of wisdom. You feel those traits coming off of his character, even on the other side of the fourth wall. It is no surprise that he is the narrator of the film too.

Over the next 20 years, a variety of different characters come in and out of the prison, offering thought provoking subplots, that help fill out the final story. Veteran film and television actor, James Whitmore (Them! (1954), beautifully conveys to us a touching portrayal of an elderly inmate, Brooks Hatlen, who spent so many years at the prison, that he is terrified of the outside world. He is, as Red explains it, become an institutionalized man.

What more can you say about one of the highest rated movie on IMDB? The film is meticulously, expertly and beautifully assembled. Every aspect of the film, needed to be aesthetic, intriguing and entertaining is found in this film. It has become a cultural phenomenon and a text book film for future generations of film students to absorb.

"SCORE: 10/10

As a Prison Break mega fan, this was a perfect movie. It's like they took Prison Break and a bit of The Longest Yard, but made the story even more clever and without blemish. Andy Dufresne...the ultimate mastermind. ""Salvation lies within"". Without a doubt in the Top 5 movies I've ever seen.",8

"It's funny to think that 'The Shawshank Redeption' was a complete flop when it first came out, only to now sit at the top of the IMDb 'greatest films of all-time' list. I'm not sure why it wasn't a hit a first because, like virtually everybody else who has watched it, I loved everything about this film and would also consider it to be one of the best films ever made.

I can't add much more to the 4,116 reviews that have already been written, but what I will say is that I've never felt so emotionally involved in a film before as I did with this one. I'd heard great things about the 'Shawshank' and that can often lead to disappointment, but in this case my expectations were far exceeded. I have to mention the ending as well, which is just poetic - in my opinion the greatest ending to a film ever.

An average rating of 9.3 on IMDb from over 1.6 million votes is truly remarkable, but thoroughly deserved. I can't speak highly enough of 'The Shawshank Redemption', an amazing film that is sure to leave you feeling emotionally overwhelmed.",7
"""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good things ever dies.""

As a cinephile, it's hard not to hear about this movie as one of the greatest. Now I know why that is true. The main character, played beautifully by Tim Robbins, was incredibly smart, patient, and inspiring. I loved seeing him influencing others around him and carried out his missions. The best aspect about him was hope and determination.

The story was told mostly through Morgan Freeman's character, Red. Because of this, audiences didn't know entirely what the main character did or thought, which made the revelation incredible and amazing. The relationship between these two characters were endearing, as they helped each other out.

The theme of hope was strong and essential to many characters. The scenes with some of the prisoners coming out after serving decades were heartbreaking and made me doubt about hope for these old men. However, contrast to this was the strong determination from the main character. One glorious scene near the end showed just how rewarding hope could be. Also, the friendship between the characters was another way of keeping the hope and dream alive.

Overall, freedom at last, and a masterpiece. 9.5/10.",9
"This movie is rated with maximum number of votes as of 12th September 2017. The number of votes stands above eighteen lack fifteen thousand. If this was not enough the rating stands as 9.3/10. All these numbers define the greatness of this movie.

Tone: It puts light on prison life. It has been captured well.

Music: It was average.

"Tim Robbins (War of the worlds) stars as Andy, a man who is sentenced to life in Shawshank prison after the murder of his wife and her lover.

In this adaptation of Stephen King's novel, director Darabont delivers a touching tale about one man's quest to live and to survive in one of the toughest prison's in the country, with great acting, a wonderful plot, and a few other little tweaks to make a beautiful crime drama.

Nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture, Shawshank is a true touching crime drama, built around Andy Dufresne, who's approach to life in prison, his attitude towards life and the care for his inmates, makes him the most caring guy in prison you will ever see, which is helped along by a stunning performance by Robbins. He is the symbol of hope, the guy of light and talent to aspire to.

The ideology of hope is issued throughout the 2 hour film, and will leave you feeling inspired come the end.

Robbins is helped along by Oscar nominated Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar baby) who plays Red, the man who can get things. Red to, is a symbol of hope and light out of the darkness of the cruel surroundings, and his narration really gets an idea of what life in Shawshank is really like.

Red's tale is very sharp, and very dramatic, giving a thoughtful approach to prison life. The settings of the prison are very drab, a very dull place to serve your life sentence. The ruling of the place is equally as dramatic as the settings with cruel beatings, a place called the hole and fellow criminals to make life a misery. These approaches to running the prison is also controversial, a shocking portrayal of the system but justifies the genre exceptionally well.

Having never read the novel, this film has inspired me to take an interest in Stephen King's novels, as did Misery and The Shining, but being a fan of drama rather than horror, makes this top of my list.

Not the best of King's films I have to say, with The Shining and Misery true film greats, but the touching tale of one man and his punishment makes Shawshank Redemption a remarkable stunning watch.",10
In years to come the Shawshank Redemtion will be seen as a classic and rightly so. The is a wonderfully moving story about a bonding friendship between two men who are locked up in Shawshank prison for differing reasons. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deserve any praise that can be heaped apon them because i feel it is them more so than the story that hooks you from the first time you meet the characters.You feel for them and you hope that thing turn out for the best . If i had to critisise the film for anything it would be the lack of an ageing process that the men go through but that is nit picking. A film you could watch over and over again. 9 out of 10,3
"amongst so many films that are really well known and stink and blockbusters that stink. This is not a blockbuster but a classic to all movie buffs and it is becoming more and more known and appreciated. I love this film. I have seen it the for the third time recently and still it brings tears into my eyes at some points. The cast is great, with Morgan Freeman and a great Tim Robbins. I still do not know what to think of Andy (Robbins), did he do it or didn't he. There are several hints in the film but I still do not know, for Andy is a hard man to see through.

"I actually can't see how TSR wound up so high in the IMDB top-250.

It was a fine movie in many ways, but I was disappointed that it didn't meet the expectations that had been planted in my mind by friends and family that wanted me to see it. I had been led to believe that it was going to be a profoundly ""impactful"" insight into the nature of love, brotherhood, the struggle for freedom, and, of course, redemption. The movie for me was a little muddied by a couple of things.

And it's hard to pin down. I guess there was something ""dirty"" about the idea that the redemption took the form of everything turning out rosy and perfect for Our Heroes; that it was an outer redemption, rather than an inner redemption. It just felt as though the level of insight I was expecting would have to look a little more different from the ""standard"" (as it were) firehose of hollywoodesque plot twists, black/white hat-ism, and rosy outcome. To give you an idea of where I'm coming from, the redemption scene at the end of...Eraserhead(!)...is cleaner in my mind than Shawshank, just because we are forced to fill in the blanks left by a totally alien projection of spiritual struggle. When we fill in the blanks, we have to draw upon the (in this case) redemption ""within us""; Shawshank seems to be attempting to fill in all the blanks, leaving nothing for us to do. And, as I already said, some of the fill is questionable in my mind.

Lastly, I was unable to pick up on a key plot element toward the end; how exactly did Andy ""nail"" the prison officialdom? It appeared he was able to ""hip"" state oversight to the egregious abuses of power; but that a mere prisoner--even one vested with a certain amount of bureaucratic access--should be able to accomplish this seems impossible, and I was not even able to make out the general contours of such a mechanism in the movie. I'll admit I might maybe have to see the movie again. And the movie was good enough that I might well do just that. But, again, when friends/family/IMDB-user-commenters said this was a billion thumbs-up movie, I expected something somehow more challenging.",10
"So says the warden of Shawshank prison, though Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) finds it belongs to a lot more people in this often-harrowing tale.

The Shawshank Redemption is a very, very clever film in that it takes its call from elder cinema, meaning it can net not only acclaim but also a wider audience. It's surely no coincidence that the first sound we hear  before the titles have even begun to roll - is that of The Ink Spots singing ""If I Didn't Care"". The shot pans out to Tim Robbins in an old-fashioned automobile and then to a courtroom where his last words to his wife were ""I'll see you in Hell"". No profanity from a bitter man in 90's cinema, though expletives do flavour the piece, with 24 uses of the f-word and 48 minor swearwords.

A few minutes into the film and part of the reason is given: the setting is 1947. However, the oldstyle trappings of the piece never leave it: violence and sexual activity are never laboured on. Beatings are delivered in shadow, or, in the case of Andy's first, the camera discretely pulls back and turns a corner while we just hear the sound. Note we are never shown that Andy is raped, we are just told that he is by Morgan Freeman's narration. That's another strong point of the film, and also an historical device, that of first person narration. Freeman adds a constant magnetism to the film; his voice-over a necessity considering it takes place over 20 years. Refreshingly, the ageing process is used subtly, if at all, rather than using unconvincing prosthetics. A little grey to Morgan's hair and the power of persuasion is all that is needed to carry out the illusion of time passing.

Another interesting point is that of race. Someone once told me they didn't like the film because they saw the black/white male bonding between Robbins and Freeman as too contrived and worthy. I told them that this showed a suspect attitude on their part as Ellis Redding's skin colour hadn't occurred to me, nor is it ever mentioned throughout the film. It isn't an issue that Redding is black, he just IS.

Ultimately, the redemption of the title comes from Robbins' humanitarian intellectualism against the warden's fundamental religious beliefs. But the ultimate testament to erstwhile cinema is that of two things: plot and character. It's this strength of character, not to mention two superb understated leads, which mean you can watch it again and again, even when one viewing reveals the twist in the tale. All the characters are three-dimensional, breathing human beings that get not lines, but emotions and beliefs. Occasionally some  not much, but some  of the dialogue can strain towards the overly sentimental. Perhaps this is what produced the nauseating tagline ""Fear can hold you prisoner  hope can set you free"". Yuck! But generally this pleasantly paced, well-told tale hits the target in it's own relaxed way. Far from pedestrian, the timing of the film is like that of drinking a cool beer on a hot summer's roof, or a whole yardful of inmates standing stock still to the beauty of Mozart.

The Shawshank Redemption was released the same year as Pulp Fiction, yet both of them were disgraced at the Oscars by the forgettable Forrest Gump. A great oversight.",10
"I never fail to be captivated by this film when I watch it.This,indeed, is no run of the mill prison flick.It is really not a prison movie at all.True,it takes place in a prison,but it is really a story about what lies beyond the prison walls;freedom itself.Some within the prison walls crave it,desire it.Others fear it,simply because prison has become their home,and freedom would remove them from their comfort zone.This is a sad reality made all too clear,here.This is also a story of hope and tenacity.You find yourself looking at the film's main character, Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins),and you find yourself wanting to have as much smarts,and tenacity as he does.You also find yourself looking at Andy's close friend,Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played with flawless perfection,as always,by Morgan Freeman),and wanting to go back and correct all the stupid things you did when you were young. You look at Brooks (James Whitmore) and you are saddened to realize that having been imprisoned so long,that he is doomed,never to fit in,in this ever rapidly changing world.Being released,in fact,becomes a worse hell than being incarcerated in the first place.There are many individual characters to look at from different angles,and this is what makes Shawshank a great film.Don't miss it.",10
"Beautifully written, acted and directed, The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful reminder of the value of life and the freedoms we sometimes take for granted.

The filmmakers do a great job of showing the passage of time and creating investment in each of their lives, especially Andy and Red. Over the course of the film, you grow to love and respect the characters through every experience.

The score is fantastic, the tone is poignant and the film as a whole is a raw lesson in storytelling. Ringing in the new year with this classic might be a new tradition.

Additional note: If the language is too coarse for your liking, check out VidAngel!",10
Touching movie that has become a milestone in cinematography. There are some of the most iconic scenes I've ever seen and I don't think anyone will ever forget the most grueling and well-deserved escape in film history. An unjustly convicted man tries to survive prison life by trying to prove his innocence. He will not succeed but he will not give up. Anyone who would have surrendered at that point and serves was crushed by the system that does not grant redemption but in him is triggered the desire for freedom.,8
"This is a very fine movie that was unfortunately somewhat overlooked when it was first released. Word of mouth and critical acclaim has resulted in the movie becoming one of the best known and loved films of recent times.

The story tells of the imprisonment of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) at the harsh Shawshank prison. Gradually over time he befriends Red (Freeman) who is the fixer in the prison who can get hold of any items at a price. Andy channels his frustration into making things better at the prison. The smallest achievement is celebrated and used as impetus for the next challenge. The film should really make the viewer treasure the things that we all take for granted on a day to day basis. The other interesting aspect of the film is the institutionalisation as portrayed with Brooks. he has been in prison for so long he cannot (and does not want to) survive on the outside. 9/10",10
It was the greatest movie I've ever seen watch this masterpiece i dont even feel that 2 hours.,10
"This film is about an ""innocent"" man who goes to prison for the murder of his wife. In prison he makes friend with an inmate and their friendship develops over several decades. He learns how to survive. Endures long hardships. And accepts responsibility. There is an incredible reversal in the final half hour of this movie, and I remember when I watched this in the theater - I have never ever seen a crowd in a theater cheer louder in my life. This is one of those movies you can watch a million times and it never gets old.",7
"By Jack the Ripper:

Not very many movies can give people that feeling that makes them feel all warm and fuzzy inside. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is one such movie. It is hard to believe that there are people here who did not like this film. I didn't really like it the first time I saw it, after I saw it a couple more times, I realized how good of a movie it was. Every person alive should see this movie. It tells you how you must never give up hope and should always keep on trying.

If you haven't yet seen this movie, see it today. It is one of the great American movies ever made. From the interesting beginning, to the extremely satisfying ending, you are sure to be one of the people taken in by the fuzzy feeling, too. And after you are done seeing this movie, see another great one, THE GREEN MILE. If you don't like this movie after you've seen it the first time, see it again, you're sure to get suckered into liking it.....5/5.",9
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is a prison film and a good film about characters. The film is about a man who is put into prison for murdering his wife, a crime that he did not commit. He ends up helping the prison guards out, and some complicated issues arise. The film is about characters, loyalty, revenge, and freedom. This film is one of its kind; it is almost spiritual as it touches on many different aspects of life. The story is thoroughly engaging as are the characters, and the different situations that the characters are in keep the viewer guessing and hungry for more. This film is a rare gem that lives up to its expectations.",10
"I don't know why it took me so long to see this film but I finally did. I've seen a lotta films in my day, but I think this is definitely one of the top 10. Indeed, it's rated by the viewers as the #2 film of all-time on this database, just behind The Godfather. This film is a powerful story of hope and despair, love and hate, institutionalization and corruption. There's not much violence in it, although there is strong (homo)sexual content. This story takes place almost entirely in a maximum-security prison. The story would be powerful even with no ""brand-name"" actors in it, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both do a magnificent job in this film. This is a film that should not be missed!",10
"Only a few words come to mind....one of the best movies made in my lifetime. Amazing all star cast. Emotionally charged Well acted Well written Well directed Great score Keeps you engaged throughout You fall in love with the characters. Morgan freeman is phenomenal. It makes you realize how important and precious life is. It also teaches how power can be corrupt. The friendships forged in the story are very well crafted by the actors And through plot development. While the main focus revolves around Andy's character played by Tim Tobbins, you are easily affected by the side stories of those that become part of his world. All in all it is an ultimate feel good movie...an ultimate rise of the spirit in the face of tragedy and life dealing you a bad hand of cards. One of my top 5 movies of all time!",10
"This is I would have to say is my favorite movie. It is the only movie I would deem absolutely perfect.

This movie is about a man who goes to jail (robbins) that meets a man named red (freeman. Through hard times these two manage to bond. This is a story of hope and redemtion that no one should miss.

I personally wonder why they have not came out with a movie of this caliber in soo long. The 21 centuary is the pits for movies. Everybody could see they made the best movies in the 90s, this one of course, goodfellas, forrest gump, casino,American history x, the list goes on and on.

I very much insist that everybody watch this movie. If there is one movie you should see in your life its this one. It will captivate you with every sentence, every scene. Now don't have the wrong idea this is no action packed prison gangbang, This is a drama about two men and their friendship. Though it is very very entertaining.

If you haven't seen this movie run to your nearest video store and pick up a copy you could probably buy it on DVD for 10 bucks and it will be the best movie in your collection. My only 10 out of 10 so far Shawshank Redemtion , watch it friends",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a wonderful film. It is flawless fundamentally because of its deep love of storytelling, and because underneath each layer of the film lies a whole world of meaning. It has universal appeal and can teach everyone something about the power of hope and the inviolability of the human spirit.

I love this truly inspiring film because of its boldness to persuade people to never give up hope, even in the direst of circumstances. Its audacity can be seen in its choice of setting: in a prison, where hope is fragile and can easily become a casualty. But this situation is readily adaptable to any other. People, habitually, are trapped. Trapped by relationships, fear, responsibilities and their own inadequacies. The prison metaphor just serves to give shape and direction to this feeling of entrapment.

We identify with Red (Morgan Freeman), because Andy (Tim Robbins), for quite a substantial amount of the film, remains an enigmatic and aloof character. But we know that Andy's state of mind and hope is such that it has the potential to transcend prison walls. Metaphorically. Literally. This is explored in the scene where Andy, after spending a fortnight in solitary confinement for sending operatic music resounding through the prison, says the time was easy because he had the music in his head and heart. He notes: `here's where it makes the most sense. You need it so you don't forget there's something inside that they can't get to, they can't touch, it's yours  hope'. Indeed his mental well being is akin to an ideal state, and as such the average audience cannot identify with him. At this stage neither can Red. When Andy gives him the harmonica, a symbol of hope, Red is still not ready to accept it as a means to salvation. However, in the book Red acknowledges that `Andy was the part of me they could never lock up, the part of me that will rejoice when the gates finally open for me and I walk out.'

But Andy is after all only human, and the trials he undergoes makes us deeply sympathetic to his situation. The possibilities that had previously given him hope rapidly erode as the harsh realities of prison life bear down on him. Before he had noted facetiously that a `convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning' was a `wonderful pet to have', but now realizes that the warden and the guards simply and fundamentally, don't care whether he lives or dies, as long as it's on their terms. He acknowledges his only choice left, deceptively elementary but truly universal in scope: `Get busy living or get busy dying'.

This choice is evinced through the character of Brooks. When his parole comes through he sadly frees his bird Jake who flies away, instinct taking over his initial domestication. Brooks is also in a sense a bird, but of a different feather  a `jail bird', who is `institutionalised', or domesticated and thus cannot cope with the immensity and the possibilities of mental and spiritual freedom. Walls bind his world, and as such, he cannot bear to live in a world without boundaries. As depicted in this film, prison restrains physical freedom, but ironically enough, its lasting effects restrain the spirit. As Red bitterly notes: `They send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take. The parts that count anyway.'

A wonderful shot of Red near the end sees him narrate that on the outside he feels as scared as Brooks did, and frequently entertains the idea of breaking his parole so he can return to prison, `where things make sense'. The fact that he repeats a lot of Brooks' dialogue shows how close Red came to succumbing, and the strength of Andy's friendship with him. The camera sweeps over a selection of guns, but an array of compasses step into view. Red fingers one and remembers the promise he made to Andy. This signifies an immutable truth: that hope and direction combined can see a man achieve grandeur.

The audience's collective spirit soars with Red who takes Andy's advice, and lets the possibilities of freedom penetrate his self, which is his ultimate redemption. An element of the film surpasses the novella  that of the phrase Warden Norton utters to Andy: `Salvation lies within.' This is shown to be wholly accurate on both a metaphorical and literal level.

The film judiciously avoids trying to make the audience sympathise with the other prisoners who are collectively rapists, murderers and deviants. As such, their reason for imprisonment is either humorously blamed on incompetent lawyers or not touched upon at all. This prevents the sympathetic focus straying from Andy and Red; Andy who is innocent and Red who describes himself as the `only guilty man in Shawshank'.

Morgan Freeman is characteristically excellent as he has the ability to effortlessly inject integrity and a noble presence into each of his roles. He should have won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1995. Tim Robbins is sublime, though to a lesser degree than Freeman. Supporting cast is wonderful: James Whitmore's poignant representation of Brooks, Bob Gunton's anal-retentive Warden Norton, Gil Bellows' cocky but well-intentioned Tommy Williams. William Sadler and Clancy Brown are also strong.

One tagline of the film descriptive of Andy is `It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another.' In King's novella Red describes Andy through bird imagery, repeating the motif associated with Brooks: `We're glad he's gone, but a little sad too. Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go  And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.' Not so for Red, however. His last words  `I hope.' are testament to this.",10
"The movie that made me fall in love with Zihuatanejo, that utopic paradise where people can live peacefully and free. One of the greatest movies ever made and one that really deserves its number 1 spot. Because I personally believe that everybody will find their Zihuatanejo watching it. Emotional, fantastic, perfect.",10
"The prison film is an outstanding masterpiece. But whether it really belongs to the best films in film history is debatable. However, the fact is that like no other, the movie inspires many people across generations. The representation of a lifelong friendship between the two prison inmates, played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is outstanding. Above all, however, the interplay of right and wrong, which is not always easy to separate behind the walls of a prison, is worked out here too deeply emotionally. It was rewarded with seven Oscar nominations, and rightly so.",10
"I don't understand why this movie is so popular. Yes, it was an interesting movie, and it was a good movie, but it was not spectacular enough to receive all the praise which it has. The acting was good, and the plot original, but it was still a rather ordinary movie. Apparently, I'm the only one with this opinion...",4
"This film, a modern fable, is an amazing success story - not in monetary terms, but in terms of reputation. It began as just another of many dramas, in this case based on a Stephen King story, and has emerged as possibly the best film of the decade, the '90s (#2 of the IMDb top 250 as of this writing, right up there with The Godfather!). The story begins as another prison drama but gradually metamorphoses into a poetic commentary on friendship and the scope of life. The main character (Robbins) is sent to prison in the late forties for supposedly murdering his wife. It really is a men's picture; there are literally no female characters (the wife appears for a few seconds early on in flashback and that's about it, besides a complaining shopper later; oh, and, of course, Rita Hayworth pops in as herself). The film holds many surprises in store for the viewer as the story progresses, not the least of which is the subtle revelation, towards the end, that the main character may just be Freeman's (how appropriate is that name!). If one had to pick one reason for this film's success (and there are probably several), it's that it's probably the best depiction of friendship between men on celluloid - no cutesy buddy-buddy stuff, no homo-erotic connotations - just a solid, adult basis for two men to bond over and remain friends.

But there are many other, I dare say, cool aspects to the film. Most everyone who has seen this has at least two or three favorite scenes which they remember forever and which they watch over and over. My personal favorite is the one on the roof, where Andy (Robbins) makes his bid for a slightly better existence, taking a big risk with the captain of the guards (Clancy Brown, always intimidating). It's a turning point in the picture and shows two important matters recurring through it: taking a risk and using your intelligence. Andy turns out to be very smart; he's always using his head. And the ultimate switchback of the picture, the comeuppance of the evil warden (Bob Gunton, excellent as scum dressed in pricey suits), shows you that a film doesn't need a standard shootout to depict the ultimate justice or retribution. No, if you use your brains, you can really get back at those oppressive forces seeking to dehumanize you, abuse you, and lord over you. Boy, can you get them back. I mean really - has there ever been a bigger turnaround in the history of cinema? OK, maybe this is why this film is rated so high - you just can't get a better release from frustration than this, not on film. Here, payback isn't just a bitch - she's the daughter of Satan sent to take you to hell.

Another thing to mention is that this film covers about 20 years of time. That's a long stretch. The film itself is over 2 hours running time. Most films, even the best ones, with so much to cover, can't help but sag in places, especially historical pieces. But that's not the case here. Writer-director Darabont, who also worked on the even longer ""The Green Mile"" later, shows us how to create films which are always interesting to watch, whether at the one hour or 2-hour mark. Or am I being obtuse?",1
"A great movie, a drama in the life of a citizen wrongfully imprisoned, an excellent plot that grips the viewer from start to finish, and masterful performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and a whole cast of great supporting actors, it pays off.

Film viewed on July 25, 2021.",8
"That such an excellent film could possibly derive from a short story by Rita Hayworth before she was a mean gleam in anyone's eyes, rewritten here for the screen by Stephen King, is in itself a surprise. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman turn in excellent performances, ably helped by a supporting cast of fellow inmates and prison wardens which give the film a wholeness as against a film with two stars and some other actors. I'm not one for physical violence, but in this film the violence is limited and justified by the story line, as this is inevitable in prisons at any moment. But the film is much more  friendship and love, with its humourous moments.

Photographed almost in a 50s style but with an obviously 90s mentality, Roger Deakins not only fills the screen visually but also emotionally, an extraordinary feat indeed. Thomas Newman caught that emotion well and his accompanying music is very correct. Morgan Freeman pleases me more and more each time I see him, though I still feel that it is in `Driving Miss Daisy' where he gives his best performance. He has wisely kept out of Sidney Poitier stereotyping, though it must be said that times have changed and Poitier had to reflect social conditions of his time and thus opened the way for excellent actors like Freeman and Denzel Washington. Frank Darabont has created a wonderful film  but number two best of all time in the IMDb scale? Well, I can give it a high 8 out of ten, about the same as the other Darabont/Stephen King film `The Green Mile', another prison film, hard, harsh. You might like to try Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn in Tim Robbins' film `Dead Man Walking' (also filmed by Roger Deakins) which has a similarly powerful message, but without so much violence.",9
"Nothing to say, really. Everything is very good and the plot just overwhelm everything else. Just amazing.",10
"BELIEVE the hype. Best film ever says IMDb ? Couldn't defend the Godfather's case if I tried, but this. This is just supreme cinema. You WILL NOT be disappointed by this, even with the seemingly excessive hype that surrounds it now, decades later. Everything is there...everything. Calling it 'perfect in every way' makes one just seem like a biased fanboy bereft of any objectivity, but really, on a number of levels, everything you will come to expect of brilliant, masterful cinema, you will find here. Its cinematography, plain but efficient; its length, just right, not one scene too long or too many. The acting, superb all-round, and the characters as vivid and efficient/relevant to the story as possible. The tension in the film: just right. We're always given compelling events to deal with, some rough and tragic, that just deepen the film more and more, while creating subplots and rejuvenating the story with newer elements, but while never straying away from the whole point of the film, which is, ladies and gentlemen, so touching and unique I'd have great difficulty to find a climax as beautifully directed, imagined and executed, and as magically cultivated scene after scene, until this utmost emotional eruption. The dialog, Freeman's narration, the complexity on so many levels and the layers of the plot, the theme of good vs evil, of never giving up, the thirst for justice, the intelligence manifested through the main character... This film is so beautiful, and masterful...it's quite possible, I'd have to admit...it's quite possibly the greatest film of all-time. 10/10 most certainly.",10
"As i started watching this i was already convinced that i saw the best movie of 1994.And i don't even get why the director to this film Frank Darabont didn't even win or was nominated for the best director Oscar.This film also has 2 of the greatest performances throughout the whole movie which were the Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman performances.Also this movie deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 because this movie will keep you in your seat from start to finish,and those of you people out there who haven't seen this movie i recommend that you have to watch this movie, And has a great premise as well. The movie also has other great performances from James Whitmore,Bob Gunton,and Clancy Brown.",10
I just can't believe it to ok me that long to watch this movie. What a fool am I.,9
"Why talk so much about this movie when the movie already speaks for itself as one of the best film of all time. The movie is too good to be explain by me; you have to see it for yourself.Exceptional.

Max- 9.5/10",10
"Frank Darabont is a truly brilliant director and adapter of Stephen King's more dramatic books. After I saw the masterpiece that was The Green Mile I had to see this movie, I just had to. Now that I have I am truly glad I did. Tied with Requiem for a Dream, this is also my favourite movie and a movie I would recommend to anyone and everyone. Everything about it is perfect. From the inspirational performances from the perfect cast (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman being the obvious stand-outs), the dialogue, the moving score and Frank Darabont's excellent direction there is no flaw in this movie.

There are no special effects in this, no action, just men in a prison who talk. But it's what they talk about that matters. All these beautiful themes of friendship, hardship, hope and freedom are in all these prisoners who we all come to love (well, most). Thomas Newman provides us with a gentle and utterly beautiful score. It is truly hard to believe this didn't sweep the Oscars (not that it matters). Tim Robbins gives his greatest performance in this film, it's truly moving and he just embraces his character. Morgan Freeman also gives a performance to remember and his narration couldn't have been done better by anyone else, it's a beautiful thing that helps carry the movie.

5/5. I urge people who haven't seen it to see it immediately, you will not regret it.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the best film's of the 90's. Morgan Freeman has another outstanding performance just like he had in Glory. The plot was as good as ever along with the dialouge. The music was nice and the atmosphere in the film felt like it was in the 40's, 50's, and 60's. Beautiful full of triumphant acting. This is Frank Darabont's best movie, even better than The Green Mile which I also though was really good. This is one of the most recommended films of the 90's and you definitely will enjoy it. I mean come on guys, it even got in the 250 movies of all-time with a 9.0 and it got #2. Excellent film!!

10/10!!",10
"Still ranked #2 on IMDb:s top 250-list, this is not one of those epic masterpieces like resident #1 ""The Godfather"". Rather this is a small and quite low-key film that brings up some of the biggest concepts in life. And that it certainly speaks to people can be seen from the grade if nothing else.

I had watched this movie a few years ago, and i didn't really understand then what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed it, surely, but not in the way that other people seemed to. But having recently watched it again i must say that the message finally drove home. For several reasons this is an amazing film.

First of all the concepts it touches. Justice, fairness, endurance, hope and of course above all friendship. Seldom have i seen a movie so filled with emotion and still it's not weighted down by it. The movie is one of the few i have seen where all this emotion truly feels justified. Not least because of the second reason why this is an amazing movie: the actors. Tim Robbins is one of my personal favorites, an amazing actor to say the least. He almost never fails to deliver and here he is mesmerizing. Morgan Freeman is another stable and dependable actor, but i don't think he has ever been as good as he is here. And they are supported by a very well balanced and well chosen supporting cast. Finally Frank Darabonts directing is done with the lightest touch and an amazing attention to detail. He never lets things slide out of hand as they often do when strong emotions are present.

While i find this to be an amazing film the high average score here at IMDb still surprises me somewhat. It's a great movie, but it's not the kind of movie i expected so many people would consider great. But maybe it's just because what we have here is a movie about the greatest thing life has to offer; friendship. And an unlikely friendship at that, simple to understand and simple to appreciate. This is a feel-good movie in the best way imaginable - one where you must first pass through fire before you reach redemption.

9/10",10
Amazing. Classic with good reason. Hope in the face of adversity.,10
The Shawshank Redemption was a true masterpiece. This is a true masterpiece,10
"It doesn't even contain any real redemption, because the main character was wrongly convicted. Certainly this is a quality production, but hardly the best movie of all times, according to IMDb users. I'd say, not even the best film of 1994. These are '94 releases: Middlemarch The Lion King The Deep Blue Sea Wyatt Earp Death and the Maiden Tom & Viv Forrest Gump Ed Wood and Poirot: Hercule Poirot's Christmas.",9
Too slow. Concept is not as good. Below average movie. I am not able to force myself to watch again.,10
"So how inaccurate and meaningless are the Academy Awards?

The Shawshank Redemption - ZERO awards. Dr. Strangelove... - ZERO awards. Citizen Kane - 1 award (screenplay). Shichinin no samurai - ZERO awards. Rear Window - ZERO awards. Vertigo - ZERO awards

And yet a movie like Titanic can garner 11. I can think of 10 movies that might be deserving of such a number of Oscars since Ben Hur (righty) won that many. Titanic ain't one of them. In fact (at the time of this writing) Titanic is rated 6.9 - a number that, I would guess, may not put Titanic in the top 1000 movies.

Oh, I forgot... IMDb voters are likely not as ""knowledgable"" as the elite cattle who vote for Oscars.

Ridiculous.",10
"1994 was surely a memory of great movies. From blockbuster epics like Speed proving to audience that young actors like Keanu Reeves can dominate the spotlight to The Lion King where mixing Shakespeare with animation can be a triumph. It was also the year of memorable movies from ""Forrest Gump"" where retards and idiots can make a difference; ""Pulp Fiction"" was a wild ride filled with violence and language to make you have nightmares; ""Quiz Show"" questioned the stunts on game shows; ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"" proved to be a barrel of laughs and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" proves that drama takes place in all sides and all directions.

The films I placed in quotations where nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1995. ""Gump"" was the big winner taking home more awards and proving that a person of idiocy and a strong heart can change a person's life; ""Pulp"" won the original screenplay making Tarantino a star; ""Quiz Show"" and ""Funerals"" had less nominations but no wins. ""Shawshank"" is remembered for being a small movie with so many nominations that it didn't receive one award! Not One! There's a thing with certain movies where once they became failures, they become cult classics. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies.

Based on the novel by Stephen King, the film starts in the late 1940's about a hot shot banker by the name of Andy Dufrense (a superb Tim Robbins) who comes home drunk one night before finding his wife along with another man dead. By the time the cops arrive, they see that Andy has a gun with several bullets on the floor. They arrest him, but Andy didn't commit the crime where after a trial hearing, he is sent to Shawshank prison where his sentence is double life; one for each of his victims.

Andy is the fresh meat in Shawshank along with a couple of new inmates where they meet with Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), one real mean S.O.B. who believes in two things: Discipline and the bible. Norton's right hand man Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) is the true shark of the institution where prisoners think of the warden as child's play compared to the captain who harasses all of the inmates. Andy meets several old inmates from Ellis Boyd Redding, or Red (played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman), who's doing time from murder where he's the inmates right hand man in terms of getting items from toothpicks to cigarettes and knowing everything about everyone. There's also Brooks (James Whitmore), the old-timer who plays an important part of the prison where everybody looks up to him. As each decade passes, Andy gets the prison involved in several little projects from helping the warden along with the guards and staff with their taxes to creating a public library for the prisoners where secrets are being kept from the hero. There's even a new inmate who enters Shawshank in the 1960's who knows the truth about Andy being set-up. Only time will tell when Andy will be released from prison along with having one of the most satisfying climaxes in movie or jail history.

This movie really deserves all the attention it earns.",10
"I know this film so well that I use it as a connection. Whenever I see another movie or television show, I find some way to connect it to Shawshank. Kinda like the degrees of Kevin Bacon. There are so many great actors in this one movie and when I see them in another movie, I always think of Shawshank. Red's (Morgan Freeman) monologue from the moment the warden discovered Andy's tunnel to the end of the movie was some of the best storytelling I've ever heard. My one minor complaint was when Red mentioned 500 yards being nearly half a mile. 440 yards is a quarter of a mile so it was 60 yards more than that. (Numbers are one of my OCD issues) 😄. Hands down the best movie of the twentieth century.",10
"I finally watched this movie today and I should have watched it way sooner. This is probably the most interesting movie I have ever seen; It has a very intriguing plot and there isn't any dull moments. You will feel so connected with the characters who were portrayed very well I got to say. Its a disgrace this movie did so badly in the box office. You should definitely watch this movie, even if you're not into drama movies because this a very intriguing movie.",10
"A movie that has gained notoriety for being the highest rated on the IMDB, and is considered by many to be the best movie ever made, the largest directed by Frank Darabont, is far from it, but in fact, it's a great movie that stands out for its quality set where all the fundamentals a movie needs are good and work well, leaving the movie error free but still lacking something plus the extraordinary, so even a flawless movie can't be perfect.

The script is a great adaptation of the book, a consistent script, a landscape of characters and scenarios, with causes and consequences, no delusions and very tightly tied, it's a linear plot and no stones in the way, even for almost two and a half hours. The duration is not enough for the viewer, because the packages are not the mood and experiences as mutations of each character.

""A dream of freedom,"" is a well-directed book, a gray photo and a sober camera, ""great character patterns and scene measurement, a great atmosphere, and a great level of touch,"" ""is not a dream of freedom is great too "". The serene and true wallpapers, without exaggeration or unnecessary dramas, stand out mainly by Tim Robbins and Morgam Freeman.

""A Dream of Freedom"" is a film that deals with the cruel power of adaptation of the human being, accustomed to a feeling and an experience to be part of all this kind of life, another reality, when I say this, has no work, no has relationship in the city, but here we go to the extreme, we go to an experience that lasts 30, 40, 50 years ... men imprisoned, physically, morally and sentimentally deprived of the most basic things, the long is cruel and central, he touches and shocks, talks to the viewer through the most felt privations of detainees, an art. For many wired point and subject, getting between the script and a steering, bepending the development of the movie and the viewer himself.

""A dream of freedom"" is a flawless, great movie, and is recommended for all audiences, still a bit of the extraordinary, the magician, but without his own achievements, is not one of the biggest hits ever, but, as A great movie.",8
"Honestly, I never expected to love The Shawshank Redemption because I'm not really into these kinds of films. This time, in April 2023, is my first time watching it as it never really caught my interest before. I was also always wondering why this got 9.3 stars and millions of ratings on IMDB.

The script is beautifully written, with some unforgettable dialogues that stays in the mind. The movie is superbly acted by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The film has some life lessons to offer, and makes you realize things. Also, the story shows the brutal reality of being in the prison.

The Shawshank Redemption is a deeply moving story about friendship, hope, and dreams. It also has one of the most perfect endings I've ever seen. Now I know why the rating is very high on IMDB. Highly recommended.",5
"The Shawshank Redemption (1994, Dir. Frank Darabont)

Announced guilty for the murder of his wife, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison to serve a life term. Becoming friends with Red (Morgan), Andy tries to adapt to prison life, and goes on an unforgettable journey with Red inside the prison walls.

Brilliant, Powerful and Moving storytelling brought together by everyone involved. Robbins and Freeman showcase their full acting talents and provide amazing performances in a wonderful classic that deserved top mark in best film lists.

Get busy living, or get busy dying.  Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman)",9
"This is a motivational story about a group of people in prison. It shows them going through many different conflicts. Most of the guards treat them badly and often abuse the inmates. The ugly realities of prison life are realized in the first half hour of the movie. There was strong acting on all parts. It was expertly shot too. It deserves all of the praise it has received. It's been near the top of IMDb's top 10 for years and it's showing no signs of slowing down. It's very moving and it has a lot of character development. It perfectly represents all the struggles that the characters go through. Also, the movie is highly brutal. Especially near the beginning. This isn't for anyone who doesn't like brutality but it's rather fitting in this movie. The way it combined brutality with a highly memorable story makes it something special. It touched me in a way that I cannot describe. Without any doubt, it's the best drama ever and one of the greatest movies of all time.",10
"As I write these, the IMDB poll has this listed as the top film of their top 250 films of all time. I'm a little surprised by this, as you can imagine. On the one hand, it's always nice to see a list that's willing to throw a curve, instead of automatically putting CITIZEN KANE at the top, and this choice certainly qualifies. And don't get me wrong, I think this is a very good film. The relationship between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is well played out (and both actors are excellent), the story is well-adapted from the Stephen King novella, and Frank Darabont deserves credit for keeping it simple without making it simplistic.

On the other hand, the greatest film of all time? It didn't even make my top 10 for 1994 (they were, btw, PULP FICTION, QUIZ SHOW, HOOP DREAMS, THREE COLORS: RED, THE BOYS OF ST. VINCENT, THE LAST SEDUCTION, NOBODY'S FOOL, BURNT BY THE SUN, SIRENS, and ED WOOD). It did indulge in a few cliches, like the caged bird kept by James Whitmore's character, and the ""sisters"", that prevented it from being a 5-star movie(that's my highest rating). Nevertheless, it is a very good movie, 9/10, and I'm glad to see so many people have caught up to it after it didn't do so well during its theatrical release.",10
"Stephen King's film adaptations always attract multiple attention from the audience. People love his works and want to see how unprecedented stories are adapted for big and TV screens. However, the book and the movie about the Shawshank prison break stand apart from the usual stories that the king of horror knows to us.

The film ""Escape from Shawshank"" is brilliant, sustained, interesting and original. He won the hearts of millions of viewers. It is not for nothing that he is included in the best films on many sites dedicated to cinema. And absolutely deservedly so.

The atmosphere of the film immediately sets up a long story in a narrative style. You are preparing to spend a long time at the screen and see something interesting. However, the viewing hours are absolutely not noticed, because the story that the authors tell us is beautiful. The plot develops steadily, slowly. We get to know the characters, their past and present are competently shown. You begin to understand them, empathize with them, even imagine what they could do without being in prison.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are unforgettable. They are masters of their craft, they work well together. In my opinion, these are some of the best roles of actors.

I really liked the spirit of the era. The post-war period, the States, atmospheric shots, attention to details of that time. Prison is not a place for a picnic. This is a harsh world with its own rules and dangerous inhabitants. All this, including strained relations within the team, is perfectly shown on the screen.

Robbins' hero finds himself in the grip of justice, gets used to a new life, lives by his own mind and eventually shows that even concrete walls cannot hold a person if he wants to be free so much. His mind cannot be caged.

His antipode, so to speak, is absolutely a prison man who has lived outside the will for most of his life - the hero of Morgan Freeman. For him, the will is something distant and ghostly, unusual and imperceptible. Prison became his home. And these two completely different people become close friends over time. And this invisible connection runs like a red thread through the entire tape.

The wonderful director Frank Darabont gave his best. A great picture, verified scenes, staged dialogues - all this pleases the viewer. He took the viewer through a lifetime, showed how free a person can be in his soul. The finale leaves several feelings in the soul at once. It's joy, it's sadness, it's a kind of longing for the heroes that you have to part with, because the story is told.

I recommend this movie to everyone. It will suit everyone, regardless of preferences. A smart, iconic, beautiful story that will be remembered forever.

8 out of 10.",10
"The only reason I rented this title was because I've seen its rating in the IMDB. Well I was hoping for a thrilling experience, a work of art at least. C'mon you raters! This is simply a good film! It's ok to watch, but if you were hoping for something better than good, then you will be disappointed. There are so many better films than this! Now, talking about the film, Tim Robbins was not the ideal match for this role and Morgan Freeman was ok for a nice old man in a Midwest bar, but definitely not for a murder convict. In general the atmosphere in the jail was laughable. So many good men, you would believe it was the Sunday mass.",10
"Arguably Tim Robbins' greatest performance to date. Coming from someone who tends to appreciate movies set behind bars, this movie is every bit worth 10 stars! I was astonished to find out that this is adapted from a great Stephen King short story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.

Before writing this review, I sat down, with a bowl of popcorn and a cold one (Pepsi), and watched this great movie again. It has come to my opinion that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, or the way it was put together. Everyone prisoner should be allowed to watch this movie, and hope that their warden would allow them to keep after the books, and then use that position to break out. But, after all, this is Hollywood!",8
Excellent movie surely one of the best I have watched.,9

The Shawshank Redemption (A)------my Rating: 4.5/5 stars EXCELLENT

It is a superb crime thriller of a prisoners in a shawshank prison

VERY GOOD:- *Story - thrilling one *CLIMAX CLIMAX CLIMAX - unpredictable and stunned *Performances - very touching and decent *Dialogues - solid and bold punches and had more wild words *Music and BGM - rocked the speakers with sound effects in DOLBY stereo surround sound *Direction and Cinematography : stunned and perfect 1994 style..

AVERAGE:- *Screenplay - first half very slow whereas the second half flied away with thrilling

FINAL VERDICT:- Leave all Ur work download the movie with 5.1 sound and feel the real experience of emotional thriller.... worth watching

Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.",9
"1994 was a fantastic year for film. ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Forrest Gump"", and ""The Lion King"" are some of my favorite movies of all time. But this one dwarfs all three of them in comparison. The viewer is left thoroughly engaged throughout the entire picture, and there doesn't seem to be a scene that is out of place. The final act is also one of the most satisfying in history. Beautiful performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the supporting cast will leave you hanging on every scene.

Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is a former banker who is convicted of murdering his wife and a professional golfer after finding out about her having an affair with him, but Andy is an innocent man. He is given two life sentences to be served at Shawshank Prison, where he meets Red (Freeman), a smuggler who is also serving time for murder. What follows is a twenty year long saga of heartbreak, guilt, remorse, and ultimately, as the title of the film suggests, redemption.

The appeal is multi-layered. On a surface level, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" works as a piece of entertainment. The characters are all believable and have depth to them. The vicious prison Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his brutish prison guard captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) are despicable villains who are very easy to root against. The pacing of the storytelling is excellent as well, and like I said earlier, the structuring of the scenes never really takes you out of the experience. This is one of the easiest movies to sit down and just watch.

But beyond that, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" also works as a piece of art. A poetic tale of finding one's place in society and within themselves. Some of these things are a bit on the nose, with Brooks (James Whitmore) basically serving as the story's antithesis to Red. On first viewing, one would be mistaken to think that this movie is about Andy and his redemption after being wrongly accused. In actuality, it is Red who is ultimately redeemed through a close friendship with an unorthodox inmate who shows him a brighter and more optimistic side to life. Heck, Red is the one who is narrating and leading us through his life. Anything more would dive into spoiler territory, but I think that it goes to show that this is the kind of movie that can't even be mentioned without the inevitability of discussing deeper themes, character motivations, and visual motifs.

This one really deserves its recognition as a pillar of cinema. There isn't a whole lot else to say without sounding redundant and repeating what every other movie critic has said to this point, but if you haven't seen it you definitely owe it to yourself to do so.",10
"Rating: **** out of ****

For me, The Shawshank Redemption and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, two movies which have virtually nothing in common, have forever been ingrained as my favorite films of all-time. The reason: both films represent the reasons why I watch movies in the first place. In The Last Crusade's case, it's plain and simple fun escapism, and never has Hollywood movie magic achieved the rousing exhilaration that the third Indy movie has done for me.

Then there's the other, more complex reason I see movies, to be enlightened, thought-provoked, challenged, and inspired, all of which The Shawshank Redemption accomplishes and more. Back in 1994, I would have thought someone was pulling my leg if they told me a prison drama starring Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins (the latter of whom I had never even heard of at the time) would endure as one of the most popular films ever. Now, I'm just kicking myself for never having seen the film in theaters.

Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a banker who's been sentenced to consecutive life terms in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. His first year is in 1947, and from this point on, we're introduced to several other characters and situations over the many years that pass, Dufresne's developing friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), and his becoming a mentor to a hotheaded thief (Gil Bellows), all of which culminate to a masterful conclusion which sharply delivers the film's message.

What is that message, you might ask? Why, it's all about hope, about what we do with our lives. To most, living is hell, a harsh reality that involves pain and endurance. But if we take charge of our very own existence, appreciate everything we have and can accomplish, then the very process of living can be wonderful. Even the most cynical people I know still love this movie, a grand statement for just how powerfully effective it is. The plot may not sound interesting to the uninitiated (take my word for it, I first saw this film when I was a 14-year old with the attention span of a fly, and the movie still gripped me like no other), but it fits perfectly with the themes at work, and much of the dialogue is so beautifully written, the film simply demands repeat viewings to gather it all.

Frank Darabont adapted the script from Stephen King's novella, keeping much of the story lines and dialogue verbatim, while making a few crucial changes, for the better, believe it or not. Darabont's direction is equally as terrific, keeping things low-key and seemingly unexceptional, but truly crafting something memorable and brilliant. Thomas Newman's remarkable score is emotionally touching and uplifting, perfectly fitting with the movie's tone.

But great as the direction and writing may be, what puts this over the top for me are the performances. Everyone here is excellent, without the slightest minor exception. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver the best, most powerful performance of their careers in crafting two of the most memorable characters in cinema, with the former proving why he's the greatest actor around and the latter showing why he's one of the more underrated performers. The film is primarily about the friendship between Dufresne and Red, how a man can bring hope to a cynic in even a place as confined as Shawshank Penitentiary. In supporting turns, James Whitmore and William Sadler are exceptional as prisoners who befriend Dufresne. Sadler, in particular, begins the film as a total ass, and it's to his credit that by the end, his transformation to a genuinely likable character is entirely believable. Even Gil Bellows is excellent here, and anyone who's seen Ally Mcbeal knows he typically defines bland.

The Shawshank Redemption's ending is, quite simply, fabulous. Everything about the final half-hour is perfect, from the big surprise twist to the pacing to the music to the acting right down to the very final scene. I'm probably sounding a bit repetitive by now, but everything about the conclusion (much as the rest of the film) is pure genius. There are flaws in The Shawshank Redemption, most particularly why Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown never appear to age over the years that go by, but such a minor mistake isn't even worth muttering to the overwhelmingly positive attributes the film bears. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect film, and I'm absolutely certain nothing will ever match it, much less surpass it.",6
This is an absolutely sensational film for all viewers to watch and really enjoy. The storyline was real original and strong. The crew did a phenomenal job creating this film. The cast selection was great. They fully committed to the storyline and to their respective characters. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman was great. This film reveals to viewers the courage and strength that anyone can have to power through life. I do not have that much courage and strength in my life. I will never have it. My life will always be weak. I do get exhausted from my life. This is a sensational film for everyone to watch and enjoy.,10
"Most likely, this review will be lost within a plethora of positive reviews, and quite frankly, I'm glad for it. As it would be a testament of how GOOD this movie really is.

Few movies will not only stand the test of time, but also hit so deep to the core of vulnerable humanity, as this film. It's a firm, warning to those who think that life should be like a Disney fairy-tale, that nothing bad can happen and that also redemption is for the privileged and deserving.

Nothing can be farther from the truth. This is a story of harsh reality, that life can be so unfair and unjust, that it can literally cost you your whole life.

But the upside is this: There's always hope, and there's always a way to beat the system, and if you cannot redeem yourself, you can always use your efforts to redeem the lives of others.

Such a powerful story should be shared by everyone. It's one of the few movies I honestly believe EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. Should watch.

It's incredible. Just see it for yourself, and believe.",9
"The story of a man who gets jail for the crime he didnt do. He is straight as an arrow but inside jail he has to become the crook to get along.

The friendship he makes with his group. Then he finds out he can win the case but things turn turtle and you cannot imagine the surprise it pulls right before your eyes! Everything is brilliant in this movie! Treat to watch.",10

Somehow in the middle of this film I felt i was in the jail and at the end I am escaped.,5
"The Shawshank Redemption was directed by Frank Darahbont, stars Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Bob Gunton, and if you didn't read the summary as Morgan Freeman, you're not a real human being. We follow wrongfully incarcerated Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who wrongfully serves two consecutive life sentences for the murder of his wife and her 'other' lover. We see him adapt to the brutality of prison life, and the birth of his friendships and enmities with prisoners and guards alike.

Where do I start with this masterpiece? Everything in this experience is masterfully crafted, devised and executed and it all comes together to make one of the greatest movies of all time. You may have issues with the differences between the novel and the movie but you cannot deny how well made this movie is. I can genuinely not name a single flaw with this movie and it remains as one of my favourite movies of all time. If you dislike this movie, then I feel sorry for you because this movie is just pure magic.

For starters, lets discuss the story. The story is rich, well crafted, detailed and is easily one of the greatest stories every put to film. Have all the issues about differences from the source material that you want but don't ever come to me and say the movie for this movie is weak because I will not be responsible for my actions. The fantastic themes of Hope V Fear that run through this movie elevate it above so many and is one of the many, many, many reasons I hold this movie on a pedestal. Get busy living or get busy dying.

Tim Robbins was excellent as Andy Dufresne and this is easily his greatest performance. Dufrense is such a rich and interesting character that he easily stands as one of the best protagonists of all time. Morgan Freeman also gives a career defining performance as Red and this is probably the role he'll be remembered for. Red is, in my opinion, the greatest supporting character, ever put to film. He is so well written, so well acted, so well done that I could not poke a flaw in his entire character because there is none. Bob Gunton was fantastic as Warden Norton and is just a brilliant opposing force for Andy. Every single character in this movie had layers of depth and was just amazing to watch. All the actors did superb jobs and were casted perfectly. This movie is just amazing.

Technically, this movie is yet again flawless. The cinematography is amazing. The set design is perfect. The costume design is amazing. This is genuinely a flawless movie.

In conclusion, if you haven't watched this movie and/or don't like it then I hate you. If you have watched this movie and dislike it, don't come near me because I cannot promise your safety. Please watch this movie; it is one of the best movies of all time and I can't recommend this movie enough.

"It's a beautiful story of friendship, disguised against the cruel backdrop of prison life.

"This film should not be(as many else films)in top 3 of the 250 best films ever made.First I want to say something about the acting, that is one of the things that makes this one so good.Morgan Freeman is fantastic and so is Tim Robbins(both of them are very good actors even if Freeman is better).The script is also fantastic and the whole complex of the film is brilliant.

It´s a film that might will bring you to tears, even if it in the end goes to far and everything becomes silly.I mean it could they could have cut out the last fifteen minutes but it´s still a frightening film.The message in the film are that you will survive as long as you have hope.4,5/5",10
"Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that ¡° hope¡± is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning. Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to appreciate it completely, I feel that it is quite possible the best movie ever made. Some may be more entertaining, like say Indian Jones and the last Crusade, but none as compelling. The movie shows a world of different emotions, mainly through its two main characters, Red and Andy. The acting is incredible. The message is stronger than that of most any movie, and is stated very clearly. ¡° Hope¡± is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever does.¡± After being drained by the sad events that occur in the movie, the ending uplifts, and thoroughly fulfills the gap that it could leave you with.

I believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. At first viewing it is the story of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by hope. No matter what circumstances you live in, don¡¯t forget that hope is the best thing in the world. And you will have courage to struggle, to forward, and to live better in the world.",8
Good movie that doesn't require a heroine. Classic movies are classic because they are all doing the same thing-letting you appreciate the beauty of hope from different perspectives.,7
"The Shawshank Redemption never made it to the big screen in Sweden, at least not what I heard of. And I really can't understand why. It is excellent. It's a calm and unsettling story of a man's (Robbins) life in jail, of the friendship between him and his fellow lifer, Red (Freeman) and the disgusting life in a corrupt prison in the 50's and 60's. Excellent performances, great camera angles and one of the very best endings of any film.

Stephen King wrote the story. Why should I be surprised? His novels and short stories make for great films - but most are turned into crap, like It. This one, however, is one of the best movies there is.",10
"Life is full of irrationality, but Andy strives to demonstrate his abilities in the worst of circumstances. He also demonstrated the ability to make a Prison Break. The scene at the end where Red takes Andy to meet him by the sea in Mexico was very moving. Beautiful blue ocean. All humans should be free and happy.",10
A flawless film. But every time I watch it I still get upset that Thomas Newman didn't win the Oscar for his flawless score. And all of his others as well.,9
"Like most people I saw this movie (a) on the advice of a friend (b) on video. I knew very little about it, but was told ""it's awesome"".

The movie is built around Andy (Robbins) a real innocent man, sent to prison for the alleged murder of his wife and lover. He finds the going tough in prison ie the food is bad, his cell awful, sodomy, but he soon learns what it takes to survive. Just when you think ""oh please don't' turn into Tom Selleck's 'An Innocent Man'"", you are thrilled to see the movie take another direction. Some acts of kindness win some of the inmates over and he soon finds a close ally in Red (Freeman). Andy goes about making a difference in prison and instilling hope into the lives of his friends. I won't go much further but it's fair to say I've never met someone who has seen this and not been impacted. This movie is what Hollywood should be about- and it was originally written by Stephen King! Get the Special Edition DVD for some excellent bonus features, most notably a parody that is extremely clever.",8
"To this point there's nothing i could say that would compare to this mindset of a man you'll think trapped by the circumstances of a false accusation, deprived of his own existence and forcefully barred against his own will, and one would even think as far as to say have no purpose as to the life he's been convicted to, more like there's nothing to live for, then a light in the dark came but the world around him was too cruel as to let it go, ladies and gentlemen boys and girls if you are reading this there's no better explanation to define the word HOPE than this, this is the light that will lead one to the conclusion that there's always a way and that's been my motto for as long as i can remember. It's like this I'll hope to get my wishes or hope to die trying, as long as there's hope fueling your every action in secret with an air of enigma, work till your hopes are realized, always remember one has to be flexible like Andy.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most touching, thought provoking movies of all time. With the fabulous performances from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to the amazing ending, ""Redemption"" never fails to please.

The story is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a small-time banker wrongfully convicted of killing his cheating wife. He is sent to prison, where he meets Red (Morgan Freeman). The two strike up a friendship that spans the two decades that Dufresne spends in jail.

I'd imagine how hard it was for the writers to make a story that lasts over twenty years still interesting, but they do it perfectly. From the inmates discussing different books in a library to the sinister warden (Bob Gunton) forcing Dufresne to do his dirty work, your attention is never taken away from the screen.

I'd really like to explain the unpredictable ending, but that'd really spoil the experience, so go see it for yourself! Great drama, 9/10.",10
"Absolutely fantastic and worth a watch. Measured with its storytelling, compelling and twistful this is brilliant, the greatest rated film on this database and for a reason, highly recommend",10
"This is what I'd call a ""very good"" film. But to think that people consider this better than... just for a few examples... all the wonderful Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Leone and Welles films is shocking. The fact that ""The Dark Knight"" is higher on this list than ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is equally shocking. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is ranked higher than ""The Godfather,"" for Christ's sake!!! Of course, this is a list based on popular taste... not ""high culture."" I have plenty of problems with high culture, myself. But I have even more problems calling this one of the greatest films ever made. Frank Darabont isn't even a GOOD director. He's turned out three solid films... and then a bunch of crap. His ""solid films"" are pretty hamfisted and corny. But then people continue to like crap like ""Gone with the Wind"" to this very day.

It's amazing to think people like this film better than... say... ""Taxi Driver."" It tells you something. Anyway, I could go on and on like this. If you enjoyed ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" it would be hypocritical for me to fault you that. After all, I liked it, too.

I don't mean this comment to be helpful to those considering watching the film. I mean it to be thought-provoking for those who appreciate the history of great cinema.",10
"This is my favourite movie of all time. I saw it when it was first shown in German free-TV. I was gripped from the beginning because the story was told in the Stephen King-type epic slowness with always something happening. Then, about 100 minutes into the film, there was THE scene. Those who have seen the movie will know which one I mean. It was like a slap in the face but it didn't hurt. It was just inspiration. The feeling decreased very slowly because there were other, smaller slaps following. Since then, this has been my favourite film and I haven't seen any better. I wasn't surprised that it was nominated for seven Oscars!

But when I looked it up in the IMDb I was surprised that it's among the top ten and so popular because I hadn't heard anything about it before. It was not successful at all in Europe. All the happier I was because I felt confirmed in my enthusiasm. I mean, I have to admit that the main reason for choosing this as my favourite was the finesse of the most satisfying punchline` in movie history. I like characters who are unbreakable because of their mental power. Yes, it's definitely a movie about hope. But it would be unfair to forget about all the other elements:

Morgan Freeman is one of the most mature actors in the world. He always chooses roles with quality. And Tim Robbins is a very changeable actor: Just think about Cadillac Man` or Bull Durham` and the characters he played there. But also all the minor characters are described very precisely and integrated in the plot. It's not just a couple of episodes: it's one huge, magnificent story.

Roger Deakins, the favourite cinematographer of (my favourite directors) Joel & Ethan Coen helps to make it not just an epic, also a cinematic masterpiece. And Frank Darabont is a fascinating director because he concentrates on the story and doesn't try to push himself to the fore by any facilities in directing, except THE scene I already mentioned. All of the seven Oscars should have been won by The Shawshank Redemption`. With all due respect for Forrest Gump`.",10
"Before watching any movie, I do read reviews here and this is correct one as far as stars go. It is really engaging in a sense that although it is long, does not bore you. It is emotional and you are bound to shed a few tears. I don't know many movies with two main actors, but their roles here are very truthful to what may be real persons experiences. I loved the movie also because it does give you hope that injustices done by others to you will be - one day or eventually - 'paid' in a way or that something good is waiting for you after the hard times. Anyway, a story you can not simply not love. I may see it 20 years later, but it is universal movie. Go and see it",9
"Frank Darabont is no Orsen Welles. This is a manipulative piece of garbage which has successfully fooled many people.

DONT BE A SHEEP !! THIS IS A CRAPPY MOVIE ! PERIOD !!!",10

The Shawshank Redemption. A large Maine penitentiary where one convicted banker/murder ends up. Andy Dufrey (Tim Robbins) has landed a double life sentence in the penitentiary and must deal with life behind bars. During the duration of this powerhouse of a movie we see how inmates are truly institutionalized and their lives are virtually destroyed by their time spent in jail.

After the suicide of Brooks, the movie takes a new turn and Andy's character begins to develop. He remodels the jail library, helps guards with their taxes and even finds the time to educate inmates. But during these times the Warden begins to bet Andy involved with illegal activity. Not to ruin it I'll leave it at that.

The Shawshank Redemption is the definition of an amazing movie. While being entertaining and emotional the movie shows us the atrocities of jail life that only Stephen King could bring and how even in the darkest of times hope can survive. Robbins as Dufrey and Freeman as his buddy Red both do amazing jobs with their characters and deserved more than it was awarded by the Academy and Golden Globes.

The Shawshank Redemption. 5 out of 5 Stars.",10
"There are some very special movies out there. There are those which are highly thought-provoking and leave you questioning things. There are those which are a mindless blast and great fun to boot. And then there are those which are simply sublime. They might keep it simple, but they execute in such a way that they drag you in deep and have you caring about the characters. The Shawshank Redemption is one such film. This is a absolutely outstanding story which is as simple as it is eloquent.

It's about a man wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and sentenced to life at Shawshank. There he slowly finds friends and the drama of their lives is the focus of the story. He promises many times that he *will* break out within 20 years, and no one, of course, believes him. It's this hope which drives the whole movie. Men in prison have nothing but hope. Take that away and they have nothing. And that's what Andy (The main character) wants to avoid.

The ending to this is simply breathtaking in its simplicity, but incredibly heartwarming and will have you punching the air in delight.

Nominated for 4 oscars, this won none of them. Utter travesty.

A magnificent story, and one which will stand the test of time.",10
"Loosely based on a 120 page novella by Steven king, The Shawshank Redemption (1994)masterfully present the concept of survival through the twists of hope and despair. Welcome to Shawshank prison where Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a new convict, doing life for killing his wife. Long termer Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding bets against Andy surviving the first night. This won't be the last time Red underestimates Andy, an error Red makes in good company. Corrupt Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and Corrections Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) may share in Red's mistake.

The walls they become a part of you, warns Red. First you fight them, then you accommodate yourself to them and finally you can't live without them.

James Whitmore renders a bravura performance in the poignant sub-plotted tragedy of Brooks Hatlen.

There are significant deviations from Steven King's story line. Even so, both the movie and the novella are superior works independent of each other.

The performance here rivals or exceeds King's other prison yarn The Green Mile.",9
"****

Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gunton.

The story follows Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully accused of murdering his wife, but he is really innocent. He befriends a few prisoners, and then finds a way to escape the prison.

The movie is one of the greatest movies of all time. It has every single element that makes this wonderful.

Very highly recommended.",10
"I watched this movie for probably the third time last night. I am still fascinated at how it shows that patience, wits and doggedness can overpower brute force and injustice even after twenty years. The movie ends on a happy note, asserting that hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things, and it does give me hope personally. No evil, no injustice can last forever.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever made,an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece that combines terrific direction,brilliant performances from an outstanding cast,a wonderful script and a powerful and memorable score. All of those elements make The Shawshank Redemption not only one of the best Stephen King adaptations but a movie that is cinema at it's best.

Based on the Novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King,The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins),a banker who is serving two life prison sentences for killing his wife and lover(although he claims he's innocent)at Shawshank prison. While at the prison Andy meets fellow inmate Red(Morgan Freeman)a man who can get things inside and the two form a long friendship while dealing with life in Shawshank prison.

Released in 1994,The Shawshank Redemption is a truly brilliant and outstanding film that was the directorial debut of Frank Darabont and his first feature film adaptation of a Stephen King tale. Despite receiving rave reviews from critics and earning 7 Academy Award nominations The Shawshank Redemption wasn't a huge hit at the Box Office and was overshadowed by other classic movies released the same year such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. But thanks to television showings and success on Home Video The Shawshank Redemption became a classic and one of the most memorable movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is an instant classic the first time you watch it and is a movie that is powerful and dramatic,meaningful and gripping,uplifting and sad as well as humorous and light. All of those elements give Shawshank Redemption an emotional weight that reminds viewers why film is such a beautiful art form because it's a film where just everything works from the direction,acting and writing where everything is flawless. The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie that has some of the grit and brutality of other prison movies but the storyline is much different and unpredictable than other prison films with messages and themes that are repeated throughout such as hope,life and optimism despite being in prison and dealing with the hardships. It's rare to see or hear such themes talked about in a prison movie but that is one of the things that makes Shawshank stand out from the other movies in the prison genre. Shawshank also shows viewers what a talented and versatile writer Stephen King truly is showing us that King can not do Horror and Science Fiction but can also do Drama. Shawshank along with other great Stephen King adaptations such as The Green Mile and Stand By Me are prime examples that King can do Drama. Shawshank also deals with not only prison life but also the passage of time going from the 1940s to the 1960s with posters of beautiful and sexy actresses such as Rita Hayworth,Marliyn Monroe and Raquel Welch showing that while time stands still in prison the world can move pretty fast. The pace of this movie is just terrific going by fast making you feel like you're watching a 90 minute film than a 2 and half hour one. The screenplay by Frank Darabont is amazing and memorable with dialog that is fresh and powerful as well as memorable and thoughtful. Shawshank's two main characters Andy and Red are classic characters who are the anchors of the film showing viewers the kind of friendship that lasts a long time. Andy and Redd look at prison life in different ways,Andy despite serving a life sentence believes that there is still hope beyond the prison walls and no one not the warden or the guards can't touch inside of him. Whereas Red is opposite and more cynical believe there is just prison life and that's all there is. However,despite their opposite ways of thinking Andy and Red's friendship and bond is strong and grows as the film goes on and when you see these two throughout the movie you will feel that there is redemption and hope for Andy and Red. Andy and Red is one of the best depictions of friendship in movie history and you will never forget these characters after the film is over. The final 20-30 minutes of The Shawshank Redemption is one of greatest endings ever seen on film because there is surprises and happiness that will make you smile and cry with joy. A masterful conclusion.

The cast is outstanding. Tim Robbins is excellent and at his best as Andy Dufresne,with Robbins bringing a power and emotional depth to the performance. Morgan Freeman is brilliant and his best as well as Red,Andy's best friend and prison mate. Robbins and Freeman are magical together and have great scenes. Bob Gunton is fantastic and memorable as Wardon Norton,a corrupt prison Wardon. William Sadler is terrific and funny as Heywood,Andy and Red's friend and fellow prisoner. Clancy Brown is amazing and menacing as Captain Hadley,a Shawshank's brutal guard. Gil Bellows is sensational as Tommy,a young convict. James Whitmore is outstanding as Brooks,an old timer and prisoner. Mark Rolston(Bogs),Larry Brandenburg(Skeet),Brian Libby(Floyd),Neil Giuntoli(Jigger),David Proval(Snooze),Joseph Ragno(Ernie)and Jeffrey McDunn(1946 D.A)give good performances as well.

The direction by Frank Darabont is fantastic and stunning,with Darabont moving the camera with tracking shots,low angles with beautiful and harsh lighting. Great direction,Darabont.

The score by Thomas Newman is terrific,beautiful and epic and is fits with the movie's tone. Incredible score,Newman.

In final word,if you love Tim Robbins,Morgan Freeman,Frank Darabont,Stephen King,Prison Films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Shawshank Redemption,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you can watch again and again and is cinema at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10
"I think this movie is clearly a 10. To call it the second best movie of all time might be a bit over the top. However, it is impressive that it has got almost 120.000 votes. Anyway, I thought it was really interesting. Tim Robbins is a very good actor and so is Morgan Freeman. Anyway, there is one thing that annoys me, and that is the focus on what one might call ""transgression"". I mean the warden and sadistic prison guards - all this is a bit too far out I think and works to the movies disadvantage. The love of transgression is always followed by some kind of sentimental prejudice. However, that does not damage the movie as a whole. It's really an amazing story which keeps you guessing till the end.",9
"Rating: 9.7 Overall, an incredibly beautiful story on the effects prison has on men (especially innocent men) as they have to come to terms with their lives as they are stripped away from their freedom and have to continue to find hope even though the system keeps on trying to strip it away from them (something that makes you care for the subjects and makes you cheer and cry for them); moreover, the film is 1/3 of the trio of 1994 that is the embodiment of cinema before that year (given by the story telling and feel of the movie being from the 50s-60s).

Incredible Direction, Great Acting (Great from Tim Robbins, Great from Morgan Freeman, Very Good to Great from the rest of the cast), Brilliant Story (Beautiful Story that looks at the effects Prison has on a man), Brilliant Screenplay (Mixed with symbolism that drives the narrative forward), Very Good to Great Score, Great Cinematography (Especially for how it was used as a tool to display symbolism), Good Editing, Plot Structure was good cause even though the passage of time was not that evident it helped add to the symbolism of losing life and sense of time in prison, Pacing was a bit on the slower side but consistent throughout; Runtime was used effectively even though it was a bit long because every scene is used effectively (very few scenes could be cut), The climax/twist was executed very effectively and shows the extent in which characters had to go to proclaim their freedom, Emotions and mood were executed effectively because you really care for the subjects/scenes of the movie.",10
This movie so great and enjoyable. It has a gripping story. Not regret watching,8
"There is only one film better than this masterpiece... TITANIC. It is truly a moving and glorious story about what is most important in our lives. Friendship, love, hope and belonging. The roof-top scene is one I will never forget. The acting by both leads is subtly magnificent. The script can throw you into tears at any time. It is not simply a prison flick or a buddy flick. I find it amazing how many people feel the same way I do about this film. I've read the comments and over and over again the same words... The best film of all time. Of course, time will tell it's legacy... it is still very young. No one went to see it when it came out but people have discovored it over the years. Word of mouth has transformed this quiet film into one of the most praised films ever. Congratulations to all those who were a part of the making of this film, and to all those who have the soul to understand it. Old souls will love the film. Steer clear if you like Bruckheimer films... this slice of cinematic beauty is not for you. I LOVE THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION!!! I am a better person for having watched it. I love film more than ever after having watched it. I can't imagine the world of film without it. TOP TEN FILMS EVER - 1.TITANIC 2.SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION 3.SCHINDLER'S LIST 4.SWINGERS 5.PULP FICTION 6.LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL 7.THE ENGLISH PATIENT 8.BRAVEHEART 9.WHEN HARRY MET SALLY 10.A SIMPLE PLAN",9
I don't care if there are some poor souls who would like to belittle this film. Just think of these misfits as beyond redemption.Its a very good story with a great plot twist.,7
"Tim Robbins (I.Q.) ""Andy Dufresne"" accused and convicted of the murder of his wife, is sent a prison called Shawshank. Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy) ""Red"" is also in prison and he can get things from the outside world. Because of that, they become best friends. This movie is full of hope. It has such sweet moments in such a terrible place as a jail. I have never watched a movie about a jail that is as positive as this one. It is the best movie on the subject. It has great dialogue, gives the audience the sense of constant cheering for Andy because he is so ingenious. The little glasses fit the character. Andy is brilliant indeed. I applauded him for things that he did, which are also my favorite scenes: the idea of walking around the jail yard and the discharging of the powder that he made out of the jail wall, was just remarkable; the big posters such as one of Rita Hayworth later Rachel Welch, on the wall; the creation of the library; the transfer of bank funds; getting that hypocrite jail warden caught; leaving clues for Red after he was paroled. Very few things in life are better than meeting your best friend by the blue waters of the ocean. I love the ending. This movie is part of our video library and I have watched it several times and I still get hyper about the stuff that Andy does. Favorite Quote: Red: ""Geology is the study of pressure and time that is all it really, pressure and time.""",10
"There are movies made for money, and yet there are movies that are made for the sake of propagating the Art of Cinema. These are movies which appear like Comets once in a Cinema lifetime, instead of doom and gloom; they uplift our sullen mood. I have never been a fan of Fiction since there is enough drama in real life.However I am an ardent fan of narrated Movies, which takes me to Scorsese and his catalog of Celluloid Classics.There was some great narrative styles in ""Good Fellas"" and ""Casino"", but Morgan Freeman takes narration to a newlevel. His Barry White tinged voice is one of the glues that hold this tale of a convict who has more convictions in his soul than the alleged convictions. Morgan Freeman is the finest actor in his genre. Tim Robbins as ""Andy"" is one of the best performances by an actor, that I have seen lately. some of the common threads to a good movie that I have noticed is the Scriptwriter who also wields the megaphone, since this gives a edge over a director who is trying to put a face on the story. Frank Darabont has done a splendid job so much so we feel that these two Characters are alive and working on their boat in sunny Mexico. The dual talent of writing and directing is evident in the success of great Directors like Coppola, (God Father, with Mario Puzo) Scorsese.(Good Fellas, with Nicholas Pillegi). God bless these kindred since they have made some great movies and Shashank Redemtion is one of them.",10
"I watched this movie years ago, and still loved it.",7
"Many years I didn't understand why this film is the top rated on IMDb because I didn't watch it. When I did it I wouldn't have any questions. You watch the film and you believe this story. Wondrous cast did the great work, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the best friends at films ever. Actors in supporting roles did their work great too. So this film is really the best in the world.",8
"There aren't many films out there that can get every single audience members attention early, and never lose it. I don't think I'll ever meet someone who has seen this movie and didn't think it was a masterpiece.

It absolutely immortalizes Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, but the writing by Stephen King is just incredible. There are several messages, themes, storylines throughout the movie that will stick with you for the rest of your life.

Frank Darabont, who is really only known for this film and the masterpiece that would come five years later in The Green Mile, proved himself as a true master in the craft. Such a shame we haven't got more of his work, but that is what you get when you have a master like him.

There is nothing to say about this movie that hasn't already been said, and it is undoubtably one of the greatest movies ever made. If you have somehow not seen this movie, you need to do so immediately.",9
This is a great film. Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen.,9
Best Motivational movie of all time... Gold standard for Patience and Give it all...,10
"Such a boring Movie

Saw this because I came to know this has IMDb highest rating

Can't guarantee if it releases in 2020 instead of 1994, if it would still be rated so high.",10
"It deserve 8-9 stars in my opinion, but no way this better than godfather, no way this deserve to be the top movie ever made in history",9
"The most inspire movie about human determination. The almost similar plot to ""The Green Mile"" which i've seen before this one. What i can say the story is showing on how human should go on with their life no matter what happen and the needs of taking necessary action if possible.

The character, Andy (which the same name with me, of course) has determine to take his wife life after knowing her of committing adultery. He has no choice but to take her life after afraid that she might gain most of his money (since he was a successful banker). As the result of his action, he was sent to the maximun security prison where he befriend a famous ""Smuggler"" man nickname ""Red"" played by Morgan Freeman.

Life goes on. Actually some of the characters from the movie i've seen them in ""The Green Mile"" and the story, as mentioned before, close to the one in ""The Green Mile"" scene such as the classic movie that they watch, etc.

I've seen lots of Stephen King's movie adaptation but these two ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" can be considered as one of the best drama movie i've ever seen.",10
"`Fried Green Tomatoes' came to mind when I first saw The Shawshank Redemption. I know they're two entirely different movies, but they had the same set-up; the narration, the way happy things happened to the supporting characters based on the effort of one/some of them. Both movies also touch on unfairness, but perhaps it's the point of view and nature of friendship which make them so similar.

The whole cast was absolutely fantastic. Morgan Freeman didn't even look like he was acting; `Red' was that real. Tim Robbins, often more renowned for droll characters is top-rate as the shady yet generous Andy; Clancy Brown was detestable as the foul-mouthed murderous guard, James Whitmore a hoot as the bird man guy, and Bob Gunton, disgusting and sordid as the warden  not your regular scheming bad guy  this guy was bad with a capital `b'.

An excellent movie, and somehow excellent enough for people to put it in the Top 5 spot here. It wasn't without its flaws, but when ordered with other movies that were nominated in 1994 for best picture (and on the top 250), `Shawshank' would be the best of them.",9
"Throughout watching this movie (The Shawshank Redemption), I found it really enjoyable saying it wasn't my usual cup of my tea but I found it amazing.",10
The shock is the main thing in the movie (three shocks ) and the teller sound of Morgan Freeman make you melt in it Thank you too much Hollywood for making this major movie God bless you all,10
"A beautiful film. I must have seen it twenty times. No joke. Thomas Newman's haunting musical score still touches me with every viewing. This is one of those films that plays on TV almost constantly and yet you still find yourself watching it every time. I guess its because of its epic scale and like a great painting you can find some new in it each time you view it.

Frank Darabont does a great adaptation of Stephen King's novella from his 'Different Seasons' collection. I guess the theme of each novella in the book relates to the different seasons. The quote 'hope springs eternal' is at the preface of the Shawshank section of the book and if you've seen the film you know hope is the movie's central theme.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins make a great pair in this, probably the best on screen pair since Redford and Newman. See this film and you may become a Shawshank fanatic like so many other people.",9
"Frank Darabont's feature debut film is close to unparalleled, and an achievement in creating a unified Hollywood masterpiece.

Much has been said surrounding ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), based on the short story by Stephen King and written for the screen and directed by the man of Stephen King adaptations and prison-centred movies - Frank Darabont. I fell in love with the film the first time I saw it around the turn of the millennium. After multiple viewings, its quality and rewatch-ability has only grown on me.

The film came out in 1994, right around President Clinton completed restrictive laws on penitentiaries and inmates. Perhaps that was why it didn't do well either at the box office or in reviews, as the general opinion opposed ""Shawshank's"" humanisation of inmates. Personally, I find Darabont's execution of this particularly touching and brilliant, exempla gratia given through the beautiful character, Brooks.

Darabont's feature debut has it all: a touching script, excellent direction, a wonderful leading and supporting cast, a grand and fitting ominous score, smooth editing and pacing, formidable production design - the list goes on - and many have celebrated its revered status as a new Hollywood classic. I personally am very fond of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and although it certainly is not my favourite film, or worthy of the site's top spot in my opinion, I applaud its inception and timelessness.",10
"This movie is a true masterpiece, and it's a real pity that it never really got recognition and box office success it deserved. If Forrest Gump, also a very good movie, hadn't come out the same year, I have no doubt that Shawshank would have taken top honors at the Oscars.

At the center of the story is Andy Dufrense, a bank executive wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Our first impression of him is that he's a bookworm, a nerd, the kind of man who won't last long behind bars. But it becomes clear soon on that he is filled with a great inner strength, one that allows him not only to endure his ordeal, but to keep his sanity and his humanity.

Andy soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison's top scrounger. Having spent the last twenty years on the inside the walls, Red serves as the film's wise old man, giving Andy (and the viewer) the ground rules, dispensing advice, and trading in contraband. He's sympathetic and loyal to his friends, but being in prison has given him a cynical streak that grows as the movie progresses. He also narrates the story, and does a masterful job. There's neither a single line of unnecessary narration, nor any scenes where more is needed.

Andy's skill with numbers eventually gets him in good with the guards, whose taxes he does. Before long, he enters the services of the warden. And once the warden begins a program of using the convicts as cheap labor- and pocketing the profits- Andy becomes one of the nation's best crooked accountants. As for the warden himself, he's an interesting character. He comes across a fairly benign, if somewhat self-righteous; his piety and talk of redemption contrasting with the actions of those under him. But as his schemes unfold, his villainous nature becomes apparent.

I don't know if there has ever been a more realistic, more sympathetic portrayal of prison life and what it does to a man. In every scene, this movie tells it like it really is. It doesn't shy away from the brutal beatings at the hands of sadistic guards, or the horrors of prison rape. But at the same time, it remains tasteful, never stooping to the level of crass exploitation or violence for its own sake.

Shawshank also gives the viewer a sense of the boredom and monotony that makes up the bulk of a prisoner's life, without becoming boring or monotonous itself. It also shows the feelings of camaraderie and close friendships that can develop between inmates. I've heard that the only bonds between soldiers in combat can compare to those between prison buddies, and based on this film, I wouldn't doubt it. The little things are perfectly captured as well: the cigarette trade, the obsession with the female image- to the point that you'll watch the same movie a dozen times just for that one scene with that one actress, and of course the way that every man in prison insists that he's innocent and it's all a big mistake.

Through the experiences of Brooks, the old librarian, we also see little known dilemma of so many long-term inmates returning to society. Despite all the hardships of prison life, the drudgery, the bad food, the loss of freedom, Brooks has become not only accustomed to, but dependent on life within the walls. After all the years he's spent at Shawshank Penitentiary he's forgotten the outside world, and the outside world, in turn, has moved on, becoming something completely different from what he once knew. All of his friends, his life's work, and his purpose are there in the prison. Inside, he's well liked, a learned man and intellectual among his peers. Outside, he's just an ex-con who's past his prime and not so steady on his feet anymore.

A real measure of this movie's greatness is that so much depth is given, and so much sympathy generated, for someone who is really a minor player. His story is only a subplot, yet this film spends more time and effort characterizing him than many movies spend on their main characters.

Another important theme is what confinement can do to a man's soul. After years behind bars, most of the inmate's spirits are downtrodden, if not broken. For them, true happiness is but a memory; hope an entirely foreign idea. ""Hope is dangerous. Hope can get you killed."" Red tells Andy at one point. But Andy is not like the others. He clings on to hope, even when he has every reason to believe he'll spend the rest of his life in Shawshank. He's determined that no matter what, he will not let his spirit be broken.

The ending is one of the best I've ever seen, and I wouldn't dream of giving this one away. I will say that nearly everything that's happened up to now has, in one way or another, led to this, and that when it's over, you'll be amazed and uplifted.

Shawshank is right up there with the best of Copula, Spielberg, or Kurosawa. It's the kind of movie that can restore your faith in cinema. No matter how many lackluster sequels or half-baked packaged deals the studios come out with, there will always be the Shawshank Redemption.",10
"No one can take away your hope in your mind. 19 years' waiting in the jail. Nothing is impossible.

The movie showcase an intense passion to crave for freedom. The man utimately regain control of his life. Every single man on earth should live a life as the male lead does. A very encouraging film.",10
"After the closing credits roll, The Shawshank Redemption won't leave you. Your heart will throb for humanity, the moral integrity shown by the men and women in the movie, and their triumphs and struggles. The movie is a fantastic illustration of how a story can attract viewers on both an intellectual and emotional level.. We follow Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding's connection while they serve out their sentences at the Ohio State Reformatory (Morgan Freeman). An emotional examination of friendship, hope, and the human spirit is provided in the film. You will be astounded by Robbins and Freeman's understated yet powerful performances. In every sense, their performances are superb. Frank Darabont did a fantastic job directing and shooting the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is a joy to see since it is humorous, touching, and inspirational. This film will make you ponder, cry, and both. You must watch it if you enjoy reading books and watching movies. After viewing this timeless work, you'll be inspired and encouraged.",10
"Who said Citizen Kane? Who said Casablanca ?. You can keep your mouth shut, because friends, this is the best movie in history. I can't understand how in 1994 a movie (Forrest Gump), also very good but inferior to this one, won several Oscars, including the best film. Also that year was also Pulp Fiction, another that is above Forrest Gump. The fact is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has it all. A great script, based on the novel of Stephen King (the best novel of him, without a doubt), a relentless direction like that of Daranbont, a spectacular photograph that is accompanied by an impressive soundtrack, the editing is excellent and the performances are all magnificent, highlighting especially the always brilliant Morgan Freeman. My friends, if you really want to see good movies, do not hesitate to see this movie, you will love it, I loved it and it will remain, at least for many years, my favorite movie.",10
"It's unbelievable -- I'm dumbfounded. As of this writing, Shawshank Redemption is #2 in the top 250 films in the IMDB (I'm sure ""The Godfather"" still holds the #1 spot). That is simply incredible for a film released seven years ago, absolutely mindblowing. This movie captured more than just a generation, it captured the hearts and minds of the global moviegoing public, and apparently will not let go.

Think of the hundreds of films released since 1994... and realize that ""Shawshank Redemption"" holds the #2 spot... on the world's most popular film site -- truly the worldwide *people's* democratic vote!

If you still haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself. With perhaps the most cathartic, satisfying ending in film history, superb, sharply-defined characters and plot, plot, plot... this is the film to see if you love movies, and even if you hate movies. If you see only one movie in your lifetime, this may be the one to see (you can read 'The Godfather', which in my opinion is much better in book format).

A work of art that is not going to go away, ""Shawshank Redemption"" is the best prison movie ever released and one of the greatest films of all time.",10
"As near to perfect as a movie can get, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is absolutely superlative entertainment. I keep wondering at those who claim the movie is too long (as many also did for the fantastic ""Green Mile""). I wonder if MTV, television newscasts, commercials and other things have destroyed the attention span of several generations of people. Nobody seems to be able to stick with anything for more than an absolute maximum of two hours anymore. It's a disappointing trend, because often a great story cannot be told in the usual 120-minute maximum alloted to most films.

If you have the attention span to watch a film longer than two hours, movies just don't get any better than this one does. Don't look for realism (try PBS or any documentary for that), look for plot, acting talent and (above all): Simply a good, satisfying tale! The Shawshank Redemption has it all, in spades, and Frank Darabont is on his way to an absolutely stellar directing career. Kudos to Stephen King as well for his excellent novella, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" which obviously helped make this film possible. 10/10.",9
"It's not the easiest thing in the world to describe with words how perfect THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really is.

Well, let's try. It won't take long, read other comments for closer details and views. This is a fantastic unforgettable movie where a banker (Robbins) gets his life changed, when he get a double life-sentence because of the murder of his wife and her lover. The first years gets to be a pure hell, he gets harassed, and he doesn't fit in. When he meet Freeman and his pals and starts a friendly relationship the movie starts up. Memorable and entertaining movie with big lifts by most of the fantastic cast. And this is coming from Stephen King?

"I'm gonna start like this: The movie touched me and I think it is great, but it does have flaws.

First off: Good production, well casted and great acting, one of Freeman's best roles and setting, camera, costumes, props etc. have a high standard.

I think the plot was good, but for the most part predictable, nothing surprised me, still a smart and touching prison story. Yet I caught myself doubting some parts of the happenings and sometimes the production looked too slick.

I don't think it's a 10 since there are small things I would've done differently, giving it 9/10 since it's still a great movie.",10
"This is easily the best movie of the '90s. Or maybe one of the best movies of the '90s. Stephen King's sure does show us that he can make awesome books besides horrors. He also made The Green Mile. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in this excellent movie. they both should've won Academy Awards for this one. Definitely. I love this movie. I must have saw this movie about 20 times. It is as great as the critics say it is. The direction for this is amazing.

Overall the whole movie is great and I am surprised that Stephen King made such a good novel. I've made my mind for the best movie of the '90s. Rating 11 out of 10. (Best Movie of the '90s)",10
"One of the most wonderfully perfect movies of all time, you wouldn't want to change a single frame.

"The perfect movie doesn't exist... except for maybe this one.

The casting is perfect, Thomas Newman's score remarkable, and plot compelling at all points throughout. They simply don't make them like this anymore

Wholesome and blissful.

"This survey proves that the American Film Institute's ""Top 100"" and Hollywood's ""Academy Awards"" are nothing but a fraud. Like many others, I did not go see this movie in the theater because Forrest Gump was out at the same time, hogging all the publicity. What a shame. This movie should have swept the Oscars for best picture, best acting (lead and supporting), best directing, best screenplay....etc.

I simply could not believe it when I saw that the AFI Top 100 did not include this picture at all. It is simply the best film ever made. Given the highly different tastes of individuals, it is rare that you can ask friends and acquaintances what the best movie that they have ever seen is and consistently hear the response: ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Everything, every scene, in this movie works. With the exception of special effects (this film does not need them), this is the movie all others should be measured against.",7
"Dubbed 'the greatest film of all time' by many, 1994's The Shawshank Redemption took cinemas across the globe by storm, evoking moments of brilliance measured with an appropriate, precise finish - to master the art of cinematography packaged into 142 sensational minutes.

Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner.

A cold prison concourse is the primary setting, with tinges of sunlight offering a sense of false security to the facility of danger and vulnerability. As the film progresses we learn the truths behind the cell walls and the welded fences; a radiating communal feel is present throughout the picture, with even the times of brutality and violence depicted in an explicit manner proving but secondary to the at-times complimenting prison guards and a library of comfort and safety.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins shine in their respective roles, the former encapsulating the calm and regretful Ellis while the latter portrays the intelligent, patient Andy to form an unlikely friendship between one another. We sympathise with the characters, particularly old Brooks Hatlen who plays an integral role in epitomising the capabilities of change and that if there's good in someone, it can always be found, and always be recognised.

We as viewers are engrossed in the scintillating screenplay which in an age of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Forrest Gump' shrugged to appeal to a wider range at first, criticised for its lack of female characters; though, given time, The Shawshank Redemption was understood for its alternative outlook on film, it doesn't confine itself to one specific genre ""the crime elements are peripheral and there's more humour than one might find in a typical thriller. Instead, The Shawshank Redemption deals in universal themes that almost anyone can relate to and almost anyone can enjoy"".

An emblem of filmography, with scenes that we will always remember, and some we ought to forget. The perfect mix, of a decorated watch.",10
"When one thinks of how many dross films have somehow managed to win Oscars you begin to lose faith when the classic SR doesn't even win one.

For the life of me I don't know why this film was overlooked - sure the critics didn't like it, and it didn't do too well at the Box Office because the title was just too difficult or ambiguous to remember. Nevertheless by the time it went to Video the film has had a second life to the point where it is in the top three films of all time according to the members of IMDb, and rightly so.

Prison films are nothing new of course, and neither is SR. But SR shines from so many areas that it has to be the best prison film ever.

I was particularly impressed with the cinematography from Roger Deakins, especially those wonderful sweeping pan shots from of the prison taken from above.

The acting is a revelation from all concerned especially Morgan Freeman who really should have won an Oscar. But then there's Robbins himself who I've never really warmed to, except perhaps for Jacobs Ladder. But he really is a tour-de-force here and should be proud of this film.

But the acting plaudits go deeper than just the two main stars; the support from Bob Gunton, William Sadler & especially Clancy Brown also deserve huge credit.

Its a very hard, uncompromising film but it doesn't play to stereotype. The violence is very real and yet warranted I think.

It does fall to the cliche trap on one or two occasions - the ending, although generally well done, was perhaps just a little pretencious for my liking, especially the preachy monologue from Freeman jarred just a tad.

Another annoying thing is the ageing process. Robbins hardly ages at all during his 20 year stay...but I'm quibbling.

SR is a superb, moving & rewarding film full of hope & belief. The sudden surge of emotional energy that went through me as Robbins stands in the pool, his arms outstretched as the rain lashes down on him!

In my virtual world The Shawshank Redemption won 10 Oscars and became a Box Office champ and was loved by the critics. The real world, just like the real world outside Shawshank Prison, is simply too cruel to want to think about!",10
"The movie has excellent acting, excellent cinematography, and great music. Its one of those roller coasters of emotion movies that in the end leaves you feeling good. It's one of the best book to film transitions ever. Stephen King's may be best known for his horror writing but this is not horror. The movies success starts with the brilliant Steven King novel that it was based on ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". You can find the novella in a 1982 King collection, ""Different Seasons"", along with a story, ""The Body,"" that became the basis for the another top notch movie the 1986 smash ""Stand by Me"". It celebrates the triumph of the human spirit. It's not a simple feel good movie- there is a good deal of brutality in it. As one of the characters explains: ""this is no fairy tale world.""

It is about a 20 year friendship between two men in a prison (in my opinion). In telling that story the narrative highlights the memorable moments. The film is also about long-term imprisonment. The movie is not driving towards it's conclusion. A lot happens, and the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. The conclusion comes about as just another story among other stories. The story teller just saves the best story for last.

The Bottom Line: It can be as much a spiritual experience as it is a simple movie. Turned into a classic!",1
"Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

With The Shawshank Redemption number 1 on the top 250, you can easily say that I had huge expectations. I never thought of it as the best movie ever, but I still thought it would a great, moving experience that gradually deserved it's position. If your expecting just that; I suggest to throw your expectations away and keep away. HONESTLY, I found the film to be quite good but the movie is obviously overrated. First up, the acting and directing was fantastic. The first, say, 30 minutes had drawn me in fantastically. Unforgivably, this is the point where the movie dragged itself down and made me lose interest a couple times. Again, this is no way means I hated the film; I found it to be great, but the fact that this film is top (especially over The Godfather) confuses me. Honestly, the final minutes failed to move me; which I expected. But although I found the movie to be good, I don't find it to be one of the best. In fact, I might forget about it soon down the road. So if your like me, and had all these expectations for a great film, and was sadly letdown by a poor interest-level, stay away. I know I'm probably going to get a lot of heat for this post, but I'm stating my opinion. Maybe I was too tired to understand the impact or maybe I wasn't in the mood for this kind of film. MAYBE, one day, I'll have the time to re-watch and reconsider my opinion. Nonetheless, I wasn't too impressed. The movie is great but lacks your interest. I gets 7/10 for it's premise and 5/10 for it's overrated score. I would recommend (possibly) if your into prison movies and maybe not so much if you relate to me. 5/10.",10
"I went in to give blood- the staff was watching this.. needless to say several orange juices and cookies later I was still at the blood bank, laughing and crying with the staff. This is a remarkable movie for its subtlety- I like the fact that no one ever knew Andy was digging a tunnel- I like how he tells his friend to look a certain place if he ever gets out- and I like the message of hope for those who feel hopeless. Stephen King outdid himself with the story and Robbins and Freeman do wa wonderful job with the script they were given. Just to see the words "" brooks was here"" and then ""so was Red"" add those little touches that makes a movie great. A movie that deserved more accolades.",9
"This outstanding work is coterminous with films like `The Longest Yard' and `Cool Hand Luke' in that it touches upon our ambivalence about prison inmates. It is indicative of the dichotomous view that our society has in regard to the penal system when we can clarion lex talions among our fellow citizens yet identify with and cheer on movie criminals in theatres. Quite possibly it is the underlying threat of being immured ourselves, as we realize that it is really a fine line that keeps us free.

Of course it takes more than a play on our hidden fears to produce a film this good. It takes a good script, solid acting and characters that we can give a damn about, all of which are gathered here brilliantly. Above all it takes a good story, and obviously Frank Darabont knew one when he adapted this Stephen King novella into a movie script (you never really can tell what you will end up with when you endeavor to bring one of King's books to the big screen). He also knows how to use a camera to draw us into the prison world and how to exploit the power of narration (assisted nicely by the warm voice and splendid diction of Freeman).

SPOLIER ALERT!!! A truly great movie must have a truly great ending and this film actually has two. They could have ended it right after revealing the circumstances surrounding the escape as Freeman explains that he just misses his friend and it would have been fitting, but they continued and finish with a fabulous moment on the beach as Freeman succinctly explains in a voice over, `I hope'. For those of you who try to say that you could see the end coming a mile away---forget it; sell it to someone who's buying.",10
"I saw this film in 2020, this movie is not just a movie, there is nothing more I can write about this film. This film will always have an impact on my life.",10

"Masterpiece :-) If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you're beyond redemption.",10
"Tim Robbins plays innocence man send to jail for his wife's murder. Morgan Freeman plays his closes friend in jail and forming an unlikely pair of buddies. They never give up the dreams of escape outside of prison. There are certain points you miss the first time watching the Shawshank Redemption. This movie does more that entertain, it make you think how something is planned.",9
"""Hope"" is probably the word mentioned in many movies, many of which have inspired me with this very message. In recent years, this message has become stronger than ever in the real world. And of all the movies I've seen, this is the one that conveys this message most beautifully and completely.

I have watched this movie several times. For the first and second time, I found it to be a great movie, with a story that has depth and is perfectly developed, the characters all shine in their own way, albeit with a few forced details (like how did Andy get out of prison so fast?). The movie has a clear message, weight, and full of emotion at the end. But perhaps that is still not enough to accurately judge the quality of the film, until recently... I have experienced unexpected events, and this has severely affected the lives of me and my loved ones. Most coincidentally, I happened to re-watch the movie. It can be said that it has been a long time since my heart has been so touched by the lines in the movie.

""Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" The future is something no one can predict, but one thing is undeniable, this movie has lit up many broken and desperate souls out there, that is the power of The Shawshank Redemption, you will only be able to understand and feel the full message if the life you are living is experiencing something, a certain condition.

Andy Dufresne is probably a very good character, full of positivity, a strong desire for freedom. He's smart, hard-working, persistent, but naive enough to believe Norton will let him go when Tommy reveals the truth. This contrasts with Brooks. I'm not saying Brooks is a character filled with negativity, he's simply not as lucky as Red. It can be said that Andy is Red's hope. And people like Andy are hard to come by in real life, each of us is just Red, with reflections on life.

One day, I really want to watch this movie again, with such beautiful emotions...",10
"This movie touched me, but I'm finding it hard to review.

It is the story of a man who, after being convicted to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, still manages to find hope and a reason to live. We see him first come to grips with the way his life is, then we see him begin to see how he could change it for the better.

It is full of memorable characters who each have something to share with us if we are willing to listen. It will make you angry when an injustice is revealed, it will make you smile at a small bit of good fortune and even the hardest hearted person would have a hard time not shedding a tear during certain scenes.

Redemtion is possible and may be right around the corner!",10
This is the movie every director will be jelous for his entire life what more can I say,9
"The Shawshank Redemption will be the highest praised film by the general public for decades to come. It is very tough to dislike this film; perhaps there are some that find it overrated, but its message speaks to anybody who has a heart and soul.

Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) shortly after he is convicted to serve two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is somewhat of a mystery to Red since he does not seem like a murderer at all and goes out of his way to improve Shawshank prison by attempting to establish a better library in the prison by himself. He is better educated than most and his friends learn from him and follow him as if he was the Lord. Most importantly, he sticks to the idea of hope even after having a couple horrible years at the beginning of his sentence.

Dufresne is a great character and role model for his friends, but the story's focus is on Red's reaction to Andy's actions and influence on the group. He becomes so close to Andy that he confesses his guilt to Andy in privacy as if Andy was a priest. This is a surprise to Andy since the inmates have a joke that ""everybody in Shawshank is innocent.""

These two stars are incredible in the film, though Freeman expresses a little more emotion than Robbins does. Robbins is essentially there to be a guide for his character's friends while Freeman is a voice of reason through learning from his experience in prison. He plays a character who is a little bit older than the rest (besides a character named Brooks) and who understands and fears the notion of becoming institutionalized.

This story of friendship and hope is inspirational in countless ways. At several times it seems to implicate that characters will give up but at the last second they make a hard turn and decide to move on and persevere. This is a drama, so not everything which unfolds is happy, but the dreariness within the film makes the case for the power of hope that much stronger.

There are so many memorable things about The Shawshank Redemption. It has phenomenal leading performances, brilliant music by Thomas Newman, its use of Mozart in relation to the setting of a prison is powerful, the interaction of the characters make for some memorable comedic bits to help us make it through the drama, and the list goes on and on. And even without these factors, the movie is superb at getting such an inspiring message across, and the ending maybe have you weeping with joy.

Even though this is not the greatest movie ever made, this is the one film everybody must watch in their lifetime. Powerful stuff.

4.0/4.0",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is based on a story by Stephen King, but if you know what King usually writes about, you will be totally surprised by this film. There are no monsters or creepy crawlies at all. No, instead we are given a story about prison life that involves our two central characters, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), both of whom are convicted of multiple life sentences in Shawshank Prison.

Andy is a banker whose life is turned upside down when he is convicted of murdering both his wife and her lover. Sentenced to 2 life prisons, Andy does his best to survive by using his skills as a banker and accountant to move up in the prison world. He soon gains respect from his fellow inmates, especially Red, and not long after both he and Red become good friends. I was never sure what Red was imprisoned for, and though the story is mainly about Andy, Red's role is just as important. Kudos to Morgan Freeman, who gives one of his best performances ever.

The movie is well over two hours long, but I was never bored. Frank Darabont, the director and writer of the screenplay, keeps things interesting throughout. The pacing is perfect, and the actors, all of them, kept me engaged in the story. The movie also has some twists and turns which when finally revealed are perfect and add to the film's excitement.

The dialog is one of the most important aspects of the film and one of the films strongest points. We may have never learned much about the prison guards or the warden, but we got enough of an idea about them to be satisfied because of the dialog and because of the actors who played those parts. Also dialog is vital in Andy and Red's friendship. Without it, and the great work by the two actors, the film wouldn't have been quite as strong.

The only flaw I could find in the story would be in the prison terms for both men. If they are both imprisoned for multiple life sentences, how come they never seem to age over the years? It is a small problem, but it takes away some of the reality of the movie, and so I can't quite give it the perfect rating. Other than that, this is still and incredible movie going experience.

Note: I see that Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty at #2 on IMDb's top 250. I'm not sure it deserves to be that high, but that doesn't stop it from still being superior to many other films on that list.",9
The narration kind of spoils it at times by reminding it's a movie. But it's Morgan's voice so it is okay.,10
"Most defiantly not 1 of the best movies/... While in many ways presents things I...n A different light it's not that amazing... If you'd ask me... (without giving spoilers) the movie in general... humanizes prisoners much much more then most prison movies (a especially for the time and...) and that's why I believe it snowballed so much attention and simply caught on but at the end of the day it's not that original it's not that good... It's fine even a good movie but not a 10 or a 9 not even a 8....it's Unbelievably over rated...

you should watch it.... but after you do think before you rate go over the plot again and.... there's also a need to separate the ending from the movie it's self.... again at a closer look it's not that! amazing... good but over rated....",8
"A very good movie. It is possible that the men (adult males) will find this movie more appealing than women (adult females). Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very good performances. In particular, Morgan Freeman excels like he seems to always do in his movies. I can never get used to the type of character that Morgan Freeman plays because of his versatility of roles he has played. The movie, although not fast paced, draws you in and keeps you interested. I could have sat through an additional 20-30 more minutes of film. However, the movie appears to be of sufficient length. Quite to my surprise, the ending was not entirely predictable. Older children (10+ years) would also enjoy this movie. This is not a chick flick so boys don't bring your date to this one. OK to share with long term girlfriend or wife though. This move does not inspire romance nor was its intent. A good film to sit down with popcorn.",10
"How the hell did this get voted number one in the top 250? Meandering adaptation of a tight little King short. Typically hammy performances and so sugary you could drop it into the world's water system and everyone would go hyper.

It's okay, as adaptations go, but there is soooo much better out there.

Steev",10
"This very sophisticated and beautifully storytelling, the way a great movie is supposed to be.

When I saw the trailers and clips from this movie when it was first released, I thought to myself; ""Yeah right, another self-conscious Oscar-nominated prison dirge with it's heart fastened firmly to it's sleeve"". I expected it to be another ""worthy"" movie like CHATTAHOOCHEE or the usual 80s telemovie types. It wasn't until I sat down and watched the tv release that i really got involved with the story.

I particularly like the way the story has heart and feelings, but is not sappy or pretentious. There is humour, pathos, tragedy, and irony in equal measure. So if you're like me and usually don't like ponderous prison dramas, I reckon you should see this movie anyway, and you should find that it's surprizingly refreshing storytelling.",10
"It is hard to believe Stephen King could create such a movie! I know he does a lot of horror movies, but I never knew he was capable of such drama.

Shawshank Redemption is narrated by Morgan Freeman (as always) and is about when Andy is sent to prison for life after being framed for his wife's murder. He becomes an inspiration as he talks about hope throughout the film. That's where the film's power lies. The speeches about hope and freedom in a dark and cold prison are moving. Other scenes have don't have inspirational dialouge. Instead, they rely on actions, acting and music. All of these create some mood that is felt by the viewer.

I did have my expectations, and the film didn't live up to them, but the film is undeniably good! I don't think it's the second best film of all time, but still it makes my top 20 list. At first, I was disappointed. But, I had to eventually give into the power of ""Shawshank Redemption."" It's still hard to believe Stephen King did this.

8.5/10",10
I wouldn't even take the time to write a review for this other than the fact it is #1 on IMDB. This movie is a pretty average movie with good build leading up to a good ending. And that is the only word I would use. Good.,10
"This movie is a must watch movie. I bet everyone loved this movie for sure. Acting is superb.

The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.

The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",10
"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger

Frank Darabout's first directorial credit is a masterpiece. Shawshank is a film that must be experienced by everyone young and old. It has a touching, powerful, and heartfelt story. It has complex characters and a detailed storyline. Even after 20+ years, Shawshank holds its own as a masterclass film.

The acting is great. Tim Robbins gives the best performance of his career. Morgan Freeman also delivers a wonderous performance. All of the supporting characters add so much to the story.

The pacing is perfect and the runtime is good at just under two and a half hours.

All in all, this film truly does belong at the top of IMDb's Top 250. It is a powerful film that deserved to win some Oscars.

Pros: Touching, powerful, and heartfelt story, amazing acting, good pacing, a good runtime, wonderful supporting characters, and great directing by Frank Darabout

Cons: None

Overall Rating: 10",10
"No spoilers here but I vaguely allude to certain events/themes.

Currently Shawshank is IMDb's highest-rated film. I can understand the argument for this as it's hard to fathom anyone not liking it, meaning there won't be many 1-star reviews bringing the average down. Perhaps the lack of female characters might jar with some, or the use of familiar tropes like prison rape, nasty warden, brutal officers, the protagonist being wrongly imprisoned and Morgan Freeman being his best friend.

Shawshank is 20 years old now so maybe deserves some leeway in using these tropes, especially when considering how effectively they're used. You really feel with Andy, and can't help but like Red. The acting from the entire cast is excellent, and there are individual moments of classic drama that stay with you for a long time (Brooks...) and also beautiful pathos (the round of cold beers).

If you haven't seen it yet but plan to, then I wouldn't expect the Greatest Movie Ever, but go in with no expectations and you'll really enjoy it.",9
"Tim Robbins gives the performance of a lifetime as Andy, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife and her lover. He is an unconventional prisoner who forms a friendship with Red, played brilliantly by one of the greatest actors of his generation, Morgan Freeman.

To give away any more of the story is a crime, because this is an incredible movie that needs to be seen by everyone. I give ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a 10 out of 10.",10
"I saw this film back in high school after having read Stephen King's novel. I fought to give this film a nine, but the more I think about it, this is absolutely a ten film. It may not be my personal favourite movie, but I really enjoy it. If I see it playing on television I have to stop and watch. Shawshank Redemption is all about hope which is expressed by Andy. The twists and turns that play out keep you entertained for the entire runtime with a message no one will soon forget. I for one quote the movie all the time. It's absolutely brilliant and the epitome of film structure.",10
One of the greatest movies ever. An outstanding story presented at the right pace.,9
"Recently on cable television, this classic movie has stirred the hearst of many. It is a very compelling film, and it arouses one's emotions to their zenith. The casting is perfect, the performances are the penultimate of theatre, and the result is a must-see drama that belongs in the DVD library of all serious collectors.",8
"This subtitle might sound a little cheesy, but in fact the movie presents us with a story of having to cope with a harsh reality, and in the end, managing to move on from it. The Shawshank Redemption always gives to me the feeling that it is separated between two very different acts. Although this separation isn't balanced in the runtime, it is, in a way, the manner in which the film is constructed.

At the beginning, we are introduced to Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a man accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life, and there he meets Red (Freeman), the man who can get you anything you want. Over the years, Andy will become good friends with Red, be brutally abused by a group of aggressive homosexuals, and participate in a series of scams orchestrated by the warden. All the time Andy spends in incarceration seems like a living hell, thus setting up the dark, absorbing environment of most of the movie's runtime. By the time we get to the last part of the film, we see a pleasant payoff that presents itself in a different tone, one that while sometimes present in the movie's gritty prison setting, lashes out fully in the last few scenes.

Directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, and with career defining performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Shawshank lives on as a cinematic landmark. It's a movie that captures the essence of good storytelling and lives up to its legacy through that, while also being a competently made film, with a diverse soundtrack and a beautifully planned production design.

For me, The Shawshank Redemption represents assuming responsibility and coming to terms with a complicated situation, while also having the strenght to triumph over adversity. As Andy says, hope is what keeps a man mentally stable and in my estimation the most powerful feeling in a movie like this.

Rating 10/10",10
"Brilliant movie,I'm so glad I can see on a big screen at cinema. Marvellous and how interesting,also the cast just a fab . Highly recommended to watch",6
"Last night i saw this movie for the second time and i enjoyed it as much as the first, it is definetely one of my favorites.

Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is wrongly accused for the murder of his wife and her lover, and sentenced to 2 life-time penalties in jail. After some difficult years, he gets used with his inmate life, but doesn't give up the hope of being free again. All this with the help of his best friend, Red (Morgan Freeman).

The movie is brilliantly directed, brilliantly written and brilliantly played. Darabont makes a great debut as director with a movie of a quality that he probably will not be able to equal in the rest of his career. And when you think that the writing credits belong to the master of horror himself, Stephen King, you definetely can be only surprised. Stephen managed to write something else than his fabulous horrors. A touching sensitive drama about friendship, honesty, injustice, and more than everything else, about hope.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both great in their roles. They manage to bring a certain depth to their characters, and these aren't easy roles at all. But they come to the end with success and they deserve all the praises in the world for their performances.

All in all this movie is a must for all the movie fans out there. If you consider yourself a movie lover than missing this one would be a crime. A crime you'd be fairly accused of.

Vote: almost 10, out of 10.",8
"Who would have thought a prison movie would be in the top 5 movies of all time?

Here's a story that is pertinent to just how magnificent a job Frank Darabont did in his direction: Circa 1984, at work, a fellow Mgr gave me a book he had just finished reading. Yes, it was ""DIFFERENT SEASONS"", by Steven King. It's was 4 short stories. The final story, was the only one that did not end up as a movie.

The other three were: 1) Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption 2) Apt Pupil 3) The Body (Later renamed, and republished as ""Stand By Me"").

I loved the book. And to this day, as good as the some 200+ page story was in the book, the Shawshank movie was actually better. I can't say that about any other book vs movie.

But as good as the story is; make no mistake about it; it is Darabont's MASTERFUL direction that makes this movie the greatest ever made.

There is no way to accurately articulate the quality of this movie. A blu ray keeper from day 1.

As usual, the Academy blew it. But this was their biggest failure ever. Forest Gump was a fine movie, but forgotten months after it came out. Shawshank has a legacy, as it should.

The only one they got right, was Quentin Tarantino for original screenplay (Pulp Fiction.).

But Best Picture, Best Actor, & Best Director should have gone to Shawshank; Freeman & Darabont respectively, hands down. Not even close. Of course, Tim Robbins outdid himself he was so good. He also deserved an academy award.

Bob R.",10
It was one of the best films I saw and it should be seen with a very special understanding and accuracy,10
The film that fit for perfect cult classic. All time number one. After watching this my favourite movies are gone from my brain. I seen 3 times in one week but still that is attracting. A must must watch.,10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" follows the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. The film explores Andy's journey through the harsh realities of prison life, his friendships with fellow inmates, and his unwavering hope for freedom. Central to the story is Andy's relationship with Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a long-time inmate and narrator of the film.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" explores themes of hope, friendship, resilience, and the indomitable human spirit. It delves into the power of hope to provide solace and strength in the darkest of circumstances, highlighting the importance of friendship and human connection.

Frank Darabont's direction in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is masterful. He skillfully navigates the film's dual narrative, capturing the harsh realities of prison life while maintaining a sense of hope and humanity. Darabont's ability to bring out the best in his actors and craft a compelling and emotionally resonant story makes ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a powerful cinematic experience.",10
I like the story and actors the play role great. and great ending.,10
"Just watched again after 30 years, and I have to say what a great movie this is. Almost a 10 from me and if I could and an extra half star then I would.",10
"It's rare to see a film in which every individual actor would be able to be a leading character. This story truly couldn't have been told any better. Every scene held meaning, and every scene made the audience feel some type of way emotionally, it's really rare that a film can do that.

Overall, 10/10.",8
"I am really glad that stupid people didnt ruined this movies score.

The Shawshank Redemption have a great story and 2 huge actors that made their roles flawlessly. The story made everything in this movie, EVERYTHING.

If you didnt watched until now... what are you waiting for?",9
"I've never read any Stephen King. For reading, I don't do novels, I prefer non-fiction.

I do novels via movies.

I really liked this movie, but I read a few 10 star reviews, (and a few negative reviews) and I was pretty incredulous about how much intense gushing went on about this movie, as well as some very interesting philosophies written out & even waxing poetic. It seemed the mid to low stars were given just tryin' to add balance, lol.

Allegedly, The Godfather was once the number one movie of all time . . . ? (currently ranks 2 these days) I was a kid when that came out, and all I really remembered about it was that horse head. So I recently rewatched all 3 Godfather movies - and tried to consider the era/technique, etc they were produced in - but I gotta say - I was unimpressed. The Godfather was just 'ok' to me. It wasn't that compelling to me. I've much more enjoyed the endless parodies of it over the decades.

Shawshank is a different animal - I'll just briefly touch on what I like; Cast, direction, sets, & production, are all excellent. The fact that it's set in the late 40's, aside from just feeling like a classic movie, also gives credence to pulling off a carefully calculated planned escape - but the brilliant thing is, they captured the fact that much has stood still - very little 'updating' occurs in prison life, and that element is portrayed visually & it 'felt' still stuck in the 30s, even the 20s.

Some noted the prison 'cliches' - well, these 'cliches' ARE prison life. That's the picture. Nothing changes. What would you expect?

One cannot help but like the intended and compelling meaning of the story being played out which is this; the tables of justice turned on those who abused the wielding of justice - the tables turned on the power-drunk who twisted & perverted justice, and knowing their own guilt, tried to hide it, feared their exposure.

It's a running theme - I think the judge & the lawyers in the courtroom identified with Andy - but their fear condenmed him, they wielded their power to cover their own similar thoughts & fears. Of course, 'the sister's represented another kind of fear that must be overcome with power. The abusive guard also, and the warden being the biggest victim of his own crime, & fear of being found out.

Prison guards, even wardens, are basically doin' time too. Here we get to see some coping mechanisms of good & bad guards, which explore the concept that many of the free men portrayed, as a primary example, captain Hadley, are as much criminals as any inmate.

And this movie creates the questions; How does it get to be like this? How are some criminals free & their crimes are 'ok' or easily hidden because in their freedom they can abuse the power of their position of authority?

The fact that Andy, is innocent, and WANTS the truth exposed, is the juxtaposition, AND uses his powers of intelligence & patience, to improve his position, and expose THE paradox of criminality is what is so compelling about this movie, combined with the fact that all this was done/told/portrayed on screen so well.

Bottom line; this is an interesting, immersive movie portraying life inside bars, and what some of those lives looked like outside bars, whether free or incarcerated.

This is definitely a keeper movie.

If you have it on DVD you'll enjoy the special features too.",10
"Superb movie , good relaxation movie, climax is too good , movie goes very realistically,awesome movie",10
"Little that I write here is going to add or detract from the thousands of glowing reviews already posted for this film, so just to be consistent with the opinions of mostly everyone else and reinforce its very high rating, I'm adding my own 10/10.

It's one of those films that can be watched again and again, and never get old.

Yes, there are a few flaws, especially one particular continuity error. The film spans over two decades of prison life but the clothes never change. Everyone wears the same baggy 1950's slacks and shirts throughout.

I've always found it easier to find fault than give praise, but this really is a great film. Brilliant in every respect.

One more for the ten-out-of-ten pot.",10
"This is the real example of extreme courage and hope.

Every damn thing regarding this movie is outstanding.

The story is exceptional. Narration and script was tight and engaging.

This type of a gem can only be made once in a lifetime.

WOW movie!!",1
"Have you ever thought analytically, why this movie is called the best movie ever made? I don't know but i want to watch it infinite times because it has the power which will eloquently argue with you.

The story tells you about Andy, a wrongfully accused person sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover.

How can he find redemption from the Shawshank Prison? How will he survive the cruelty and extreme heartlessness in the prison? Will he be able to see the world of outside the prison?

It is all about the hope: Intend with some possibility of fulfillment. This movie has both aspect of life i.e. agony and ecstasy. It will give you an impression that nothing is impossible if you have hope and willpower.

Very well acted by Tim Robbins as a silent and soft spoken person, who has a lot to say from his eyes. Morgan Freeman as Red narrated the story brilliantly and given the best performance of his life.

I loved the character of James Whitmore as ""Brook"" which defines the effect of an automatic pattern of behavior in reaction to a specific situation; may be inherited or acquired through frequent repetition. It is heart-wrenching and overwhelming.

Bob Gunton is ruthless and his immoderately desirous of acquiring wealth is fantastic as warden Norton.

Rita Hayworth's poster says a lot of things which is ineffable.

A great movie with great cast because you will never forget a character of this movie.

A movie for every movie watcher in the world. 10/10",10
"This is one of those rare films that actually exceeds the book by which it was based upon. It's that good. Not only is this a damn good flick, it actually made me a fan of Tim Robbins and told me what I already knew about Morgan Freeman; He's one of the best actors alive.

I really can't say much more. This is one of my favorite movies ever and there is no way that I can make that point any clearer. If, for some reason, you haven't already seen this, go get it now!!! If you don't, you're seriously depraved. What a movie!!!!",10
"I had heard a lot of positive things about this film, and I thought that I should finally see what all of the fuss was about, so I bought it on DVD and watched it tonight. I was very moved, and I feel like it has left an imprint on me.

Throughout the film, you're left constantly questioning how the film will end and whether or not he is guilty and spends the rest of his life in prison, and I found myself trying to come up with all kinds of theories for what was to come. So, when the twist towards the end slapped me in the face and left me kicking myself for not seeing it sooner, I realised just how clever the entire film was.

Now I can see why everyone has been raving about this film since it came out 25 years ago! The only reason I rated it an 8 as supposed to a 9 or 10 is because I felt that some scenes were unnecessarily long and this meant that I became a little fidgety and distracted.",10
"I have to confess that I cried at the end of ""Shawshank redemption"" - I cried for the first time since my grandmother died.

Why was this?

The movie is a flamboyant plea for hope in our lives. It shows us that it's never really over, and that you can redeem for you mistakes and find happiness in your days.

Of course the final passage might be a bit unrealistic. I just say: Poster. But I really can't blame anybody for doing the story as they did it - it works perfectly and this final passage somehow liberates the viewer after nearly two hours of living in prison. The cinematography is simply splendid, the feeling of being incarcerated is very subtly generated and you only realize it when you finally ""get out"" of it. The pictures vary from frightening to simply beautiful, and the dialogue and the comments of Morgan Freeman from the Off are really a joy to listen to.

But this is just a very rational analysis of a film that stirs very strong emotions. It is futile to try to explain this phenomenon in these few lines, and therefore I won't try to do so. I only can highly recommend this movie to everybody who is willing to get into a 2 1/2 hour prison movie which in the end proves to be much more.

10 of 10 even it is a bit long in the middle. 10 of 10 because I somehow felt a bit liberated after it.",10
"You know some birds are not meant to be caged,their feathers are just too bright.",10
"I enjoyed ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but it is not a movie in its own league, as so many seem to say. Starting off, it is almost a sure thing that no prison movie could ever be in that category for me. The closest would be ""Papillon"", which is clearly better than this, and other movies are better at capturing general mistreatments of prisoners even as they focus on certain main characters. Here, altho there were other instances of abuse, the emphasis is on the main character in his role in the story, not the society of prison inmates. Not that I am a particular lover of the total depressing side, but to communicate negative qualities of a prison, the bad stuff needs to be presented more--the violence more graphic, the negative conditions more thoughtfully. I know people cite the story as well, but I think if this movie is to be on such a high pedestal there should be something more special about the portrayal of life in prison, and there isn't.

I thought the acting performances of Tim Robbins (who plays chief character Andrew Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman were, similarly, quite good but not great, and although I was into the story, it just did not bring tears to my eyes. I don't think the ""twists"" were all that unique--I guess I've been jaded by the modern (80s onward) murder dramas. Nevertheless, the storyline was good, the warden nice and despicable, and there were interesting ideas re Dufresne's functions in prison. The ending was also well done, and I acknowledge, somewhat moving. Certainly recommended.",10
"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",10
"This is not a bad film, and I would recommend renting it. But its admirers who rank it as one of the best films of all time -- even above classics like Citizen Kane or The Godfather -- are seriously overrating it.

The popularity of this film apparently comes from its uplifting message about the power of hope. Nothing else in Shawshank Redeption is extraordinary. The acting is only good: indeed, Tim Robbins's acting of Andy Dufresne is two-dimensional. Morgan Freeman is much better as Red. The photography is unremarkable. Most seriously, however, the moral dilemmas in this film are melodramatic and black-and-white. Andy Dufresne is impossibly noble. The guards and, especially, the warden are unbelievably evil and corrupt. It's nice to think a prison would be reformed by building a nice library. But sorry, folks, the world is more complicated than that. At best, this film can be enjoyed as a kind of uplifting fable, a sort of fairy-story for adults. Nobody struggles with the ambiguities and complexities of real life in this film, and so the ""redemption"" it offers is false.

As a point of comparison, take another film in this ""criminal redemption"" genre -- Dead Man Walking, a film, significantly, by Tom Robbins. Here is real, tough, moral drama. Can we forgive the Shawn Penn character? Is his redemption real? The film poses these questions without answering them. Plus the acting is rich and nuanced, the direction riveting. Dead Man Walking is much better film than Shawshank Redemption because it's about real life.",9
"I would by lying if I had to rate this film less than 8/10 but then if I was asked ""what's so great about it?"" I would have to reply ""well, nothing really - it's just a good film"".

I very much doubt that anyone who looks critically at movies can really see this as anything more than a really good made-for-TV movie. It's like the Bjorn Borg of movies: you can't fault it but what else is there to it?

We need more ""McEnroes"" and ""Agassis"" with flair and style which go beyond what we expect from movies that are simply good.

Mungflesh Factor 8/10",10
"I missed this when it came out, and probably wouldn't have gone even if I had heard about it. I expected this to be what ""The Green Mile"" was. That is, I thought it would be heavy-handed, pretentious, self-consciously high-minded, and boring. It is anything but these. It's an engrossing story and very entertaining story of two men and how they overcome their past lives. Freeman and Robbins give wonderful performances, and the supporting cast measures up. There are plenty of funny moments in the film, and the ending is intensely satisfying. It is a great movie.",10
"I don't think this film is the number one of all time. But than, it might be. I placed Casblanca and The Godfather higher because they haven't dated. Let's see how well the Shawshank Redemption does in twenty years.

That said, this movie is a staggering experience. While I didn't experience it in theatres, I was impressed by the cinematography. The performances are uniformly flawless. I can't believe that Hawthorne beat out Robbins to a nomination. The direction and story also make this magnificent. But what makes it moving, is it's theme. In the end, it's about hope. Not an 'action' quality, but an important one. It doesn't preach, but teaches. The music score still haunts me.

I rank it as number one of 1994, and one of the best of the decade.",8
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an uplifting movie about hope. What I got out of the movie is that as long as you have hope you will always be O.K., I felt good after watching this movie, it puts that sense of hope inside you. I was actually cheering during the scene where Andy finally escaped from prison,it was a very unique moment. This is a film that anybody can watch and anybody that does watch it it will touch them in a special way, I guarantee it.",10
"I get lost in watching a great movie!

I should have written this review years ago but.time works differently for everyone and we all have priorities so it's not too late anyway.",9
Some movies are just greatly made and meant to be great. Shawshank Redemption epitomizes this greatness. In every respect this is movie you can watch over and over again and still feel absorbed by its intrigues. Few movies come this close to perfection. Definitely a 10.,10
"Shawshank is a favourite of the Imdb. Always in the top 5, lots and lots of positive comments. I personally know many people who call this their all-time favourite.

I wont go that far, but it gets highest marks from me. Just see it. It is the simple tale of Andy, the wrongly-convicted straight-laced accountant and Red, the aging murderer he befriends in prison. They both enter and leave different people, and to truly appreciate this film, pay careful attention to that plot point. Who they are when they enter and who the are when they leave.

This is not a perfect movie. It could have lost 20 minutes without taking away anything, and some of the dialogue is trite. But it is nonetheless powerful and moving.

It was not a box office or a video hit. But slowly and surely, largely through this website, it has developed a large, loyal and ardent following. Even Roger Ebert has added it to this ""Great Movies"" list, even though it did not garner four stars on its release and did not make his top 10 of the year.

You will likely find that this movie will grow on you. It is very watchable and like a good wine, improves with age. **** out of ****.",10

"It's not the easiest thing in the world to describe with words how perfect THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really is.

Well, let's try. It won't take long, read other comments for closer details and views. This is a fantastic unforgettable movie where a banker (Robbins) gets his life changed, when he get a double life-sentence because of the murder of his wife and her lover. The first years gets to be a pure hell, he gets harassed, and he doesn't fit in. When he meet Freeman and his pals and starts a friendly relationship the movie starts up. Memorable and entertaining movie with big lifts by most of the fantastic cast. And this is coming from Stephen King?

10/10",7
"Great lead performances by Robbins and Freeman. An outstanding supporting cast, fine cinematography by Roger Deakins, well-chosen shots by editor Richard Francis-Bruce, a haunting musical score by Thomas Newman, and a well-realized adaptation of the short story by Stephen King as adapted and directed by Frank Darabont.

What still amazes me about the overall positive response to ""Shawshank"" on the IMDb is how it touched viewers years after it was released into theaters. I saw the movie in the theaters after it received a few weeks after the Oscar nominations were announced. I was blown away by the movie then and it still gets to me now.",8
"A lot of The Shawshank Redemption points to one theme, never give up. We have a hero, will played by Tim Robbins, pitted against corrupt prison guards and an evil warden. We wonder how he will survive the oppressive prison system and the cruel inmates. This is pretty standard but what makes Shawshank special is the connection between the Robbins character and another inmate in the prison played by Morgan Freeman who also narrates much of the film. The relationship between these two is one of discovery not only of inner strength but also how strong a friendship can be.

Much of The Shawshank Redemption is mood and emotion. We feel terror, heat, boredom and anger. Every aspect of the movie is a quality piece of work to drive home the feelings of the story. The entire cast is very good in how they fit into this closed often horrible world.

Along with this praise comes some criticism. In the middle of Shawshank I thought that the pace was too slow. I know we are supposed to see bored inmates but boring the viewer isn't the way to go. I won't give away the ending but it has a fantasy quality about it that just doesn't fit the very real nature of most of the movie. It's a Hollywood ending tacked on to a more serious film.

The Shawshank Redemption is a quality effort and is a welcome change from the routine action, horror or romance junk food films that are mostly released today. It takes a hard view of life but also shows the unbending will of the human spirit.",9
"The classics in classics are really amazing. Whether it's the plot, the meaning of the expression, the lens settings, the actors' acting skills, the music rhythm, etc. are so perfect. I was deeply impressed by the first time I saw junior high school. It's been a long time since then. ""Hope is good, maybe the best in the world, and good things never die."" I remembered the original lines in the film for a long time, and it was with me that inspired me to spend some time.

I couldn't stop thinking excitedly, free people would be so excited, free people on an unknown journey. I want to cross the border successfully, I want to shake hands with my old friend, and I want the Pacific Ocean to be as blue as a dream.",10

"A big part of this film's appeal is the interplay between Thomas Newman's soundtrack and the simple yet profound dialog. The CD score stands up as a great work on its own. It alternates between brooding piano and powerful orchestration, with a few oldies added for context.

Three scenes, named by corresponding tracks, are especially poignant. The first is ""Brooks Was Here,"" followed by ""Zihuatanejo"" and ""So Was Red"" (that title carries over from the Brooks track). To me, the third is among the most moving sequences in film history. You can't top Morgan Freeman saying ""Get busy livin'..."" as the inspiring music plays in the background.",8
"This movie is honestly one of the greatest movies ever made. This has been said so many times by so many people but it's true, this movie is genuinely good, nothing overrated, nothing boring, nothing bad about it. The movie is very emotional and has a great story and meaning to have hope. The movie is entertaining all the way through, wondering what will become of the character? Will he escape? Die in prison? Get free?. The movie is very good and has a really good ending. Masterpiece 10/10.",9
Morgan Freeman is a tremendous actor. Everyone did a amazing job,10
"I've seen this movie recently on my TV and it really is one of the most underrated movies of all times for its time. It's become such a classic movie that we love to see on TV.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were elevated to the top with this movie. Their performances really is the thing that should be taught in film schools about how to build character interactions and character development.

Loved this movie, I recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it.",10
"As movie legend goes, this one is a no brainer. Ignored during its film run but transformed into a home video phenomenon. And the rest, is history.

Nobody, not less myself can explain the appeal of this film. Its long, its dreary and its set in a prison for chrissake? But looking at the list of wannabes who tried unsuccessfully in replicating its magic, from the Green Mile to the Road to Perdition, its not hard to marvel at the mysterious ways in which Shawshank get us hooked. None came close and none may ever.

Divine Touch is about the only reason I can come up with to explain this serendipitious movie. I dare say not even Mr Frank Darabont himself can repeat his own feat.

Anyway, Shawshank Redemption has seared into the collective consciousness of our generation. Let's not psycho-analyse to death its formula and just be glad there is at least one of them that works, this one.

Gilda Rocks!

Bye bye.",9
"An excellent adaption of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"".

Morgan Freeman is outstanding and his narrative is very lulling and makes the film all the more compelling.

Tim Robbins, too, gives a fantastic performance - and the supporting cast (particularly Bob Gunton as the sadistic warden; he also appeared in the King adaption ""Dolores Claiborne"" (1995)) give fine performances, too.

Despite being riddled with prison cliches, this movie is great.

And remember: FEAR CAN KEEP YOU PRISONER, HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE.",9
"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"", starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Plain and simple. The film tells the involving story of two prisoners at Shawshank Prison, and their decades together under the thumb of a cruel warden and his henchman. Andy (Tim Robbins, never better) is an innocent man, who uses his accounting skills to make himself useful to the warden, and struggles to keep up hope, against the counsel of his fellow inmates. Red (Morgan Freeman, astonishing) thinks hope is a dangerous thing, and is an institutionalized man, who can't imagine life outside of the prison walls. The film also stars Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, and, in a powerful performance, James Whitmore. I'll say no more, because this film must be seen to be understood.",10
"It was genius, heartfelt, perfectly acted and overall a masterpiece",10
"The Shawshank Redemption appeared and disappeared in 1994 with little steam. It was heartily acclaimed, but audiences shied away, probably because its story takes place primarily within the walls of a prison. However, many, since then, have found this wonderful gem, and have declared it to be one of the finest films ever made.

The Shawshank Redemption is the story of a young banker, Andy Dufresne, sentenced to life in Shawshank Prison in New England for the murder of his wife and her lover. The film methodically and sometimes grotesquely depicts Andy's hard time in an episodic form of many situations, sometimes positive and enlightening, other times, grisly and disheartening. Andy's guide on this trip through hell isn't Dante's Virgil, but Ellis ""Red"" Redding, a lifer who has a knack at ""getting things."" The relationship between these two inmates is slow, yet heart-warming, as is the entire pace of the film.

Andy is portrayed meticulously and intelligently by Tim Robbins, who shows the banker's transformation from scared ""fish"" to top dog over a course of many years. Morgan Freeman is Red, who sees his decades within the walls of Shawshank as the only true life he has ever known. These two are supported by a well-casted group, which includes cameos and extras by real-life prison inmates.

The Shawshank Redemption is a film which pulls the audience in, and while long and slow, captures the imagination and forces the viewer to remain through the entire terrific, yet frightening, journey.

Highly recommended.",8
"Not sure why this is on the top, it's a meh good nothing more, godfather has elements of greatness, interesting plot, dark knight undoubtedly has those but shawshank is a movie that can easily be forgotten, good performance from Morgan, but I really can't point at anything special.",10

"Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie.It's directed good,acted good,written good and it definitely deserved a few Oscar's.There is no doubt about it.It also deserves to be on IMDb's 250 list,as it is.However,i must say that it's very,very overrated on IMDb.Even though it's a great movie,it's still far,far away from being the best one!

All of you who haven't seen this movie-should see it.But please don't believe in IMDb's rating's!If you do you might be disappointed because even though this is a great movie it's still not even close to being the best one! There is a lot of movies better then this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film, thanks in part to its suburb acting, incredible writing and direction from Frank Darabont, who acquired the rights to this story long before it became a film. Despite its poor initial box office performance, the consequence of being released alongside titans like Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, it still went on to the Academy Awards with seven nominations. At times it may feel like there's no hope in Shawshank, but the film counteracts those moments with an ultimately uplifting story. There are laughs, tears and shudders throughout all 2+ hours, all of which I view as a testament to self worth and never forgetting your own truth. In these tough times we're in, you will find that The Shawshank Redemption can inspire and comfort you.",10

"Forgivness is releasing a prisoner, and realizing that prisoner is you. This movie might be the best movie that I have ever seen. You will laugh, you will cry, you will want to hug somebody. It is so hard to believe that this tale came from the horror novelist of our time. Do yourself a favor and buy this film. It's a keeper.",9
"This film is one of those you would like to keep and watch over and over. Not a typical jailbird flick. Rather a story about struggle and overcoming and greatness. A happy end in this one feels true and believable although it wasn't necessary.

Another interesting thing is that none of the characters in it is made to be hated. No classical ""bad guys"". Everybody here serves a certain purpose to the story, thus directing the fate of protagonists.

I couldn't believe it was Steven King who wrote this. I generally don't like his stories, but that should obviously go for his sci-fi novels only. They all start well but finish ridiculously. However, it turns out that the man also penned ""the Green Mile"", another story that became a film that left a true impression. Gotta stop berating Steven King.",2
It's one of the five best movies ever made. It's that simple. If you haven't seen this movie you're doing yourself a disservice. This movie should be required by law to be viewed by everyone. Maybe it will awaken the Marvel fanboys and they'll see what a real movie is. Perfection *chefs kiss*,10
"Once again, a DVD purchase gives me an excuse to write about a film I first saw years ago - and, by happy chance, it's a truly magnificent piece of work.

Stephen King's work, itself uneven in quality, also has a spotty history when transferred to the screen, whether in the form of a movie or a TV drama. Neither version of ""The Shining"" was very good, while ""The Stand"" was converted into a TV drama that flowed better than the novel itself, but was unable wholly to overcome or conceal that book's very real flaws.

This film is based on King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" - a good story that makes a superb film. It DOES drag somewhat in places, but what else can you expect in a film describing events that stretch over decades, but are confined to a very small physical space? For the rest, the acting is flawless, the music is subtle and appropriate, while the photography and script are both excellent. I particularly liked the characterization and portrayal of relationships - not just the Robbins-Freeman interaction, but also the other characters, even the minor ones, who cross our field of vision as the film progresses.

There are a number of enjoyable high points and thought-provoking low points along the way - not too many, that would destroy the film's main impact - and the conclusion rates as one of the most gratifying I've ever seen in a movie.

In short, unless you demand lots of action of the explosions and chases type, you're going to be enthralled by this one.

Rating: 10/10 - the only film I've seen so far to deserve this rating.",10
"There are some things in this world which are beyond those 26 Alphabets. We cannot always accurately explain or express them. So, Instead we should experience them. We should admire the beauty and creativity involved. This movie is really one of those things. You should experience this yourself. Worth of your time for sure !!!",10
"After 24 years, watching this Tales of the Prisoner adaption from Stephen King novel in 1994. A brilliant and masterpiece film from Hollywood. This movie also banned from release in cinema in Malaysia due to the prior excessive content. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman just nailed it. This movie is still the first in top rated IMDb movies.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film practically void of flaw: a monumental, impeccable gem, succeeding marvelously as a heartfelt tale of hardship, friendship, and above all, redemption. Practically every element in this film is either extremely satisfying or undeniably excellent, as everything one might desire in a dramatic experience, and even a film experience, is executed with perfect conviction, from the brilliant, compelling performance of Morgan Freeman, to the passionate, relentless direction, to the enchanting, whimsical screenplay, to the powerful, befitting score; this film succeeds on nearly every level. It is entertainment at its best, featuring an amusing, rousing story of survival and redemption, while attaining those sincere, practical, and original qualities a ""film purist"" will heartily enjoy. You follow Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins through their every experience, as their trials, tribulations, and redemption are the central themes of the story. You develop an intense bond with their struggles, and how they manage to overcome so many hardships and injustices, while still retaining confidence and hope. The resounding message here is ""Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free"", and oh, what a powerful, important message for all of us to consider. It is an absolute travesty that this brilliant, enchanting, and impeccable film was rejected for even a single Oscar. Any other year than Forrest Gump and this would have won gold; such a shame. I loved practically everything about this film, as an entertainment, as an artistic achievement, and as a lesson of life: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" What a wonderful film ""Shawshank"" is. **** out of ****",10
"This film was good, don't get me wrong, but in a million years it would never have occurred to me that this film would rank # 1 in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 films [ I hope this doesn't last - it's april 1999]. It is ridiculous. It is a good story, has good acting/character development, medium cinematography/music/everything else etc.....

As enjoyable as any other half decent film - but not number one in MY top 250 - probably not even in my top 250.",10
"I have seen this movie twice and I enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first time. Of course the surprise-effect is gone the second time because you know how the story goes, but that isn't a problem. The story is brilliant: it's amazing how clever Andy is! The acting is outstanding. Morgan Freeman proves again he is a top-talent and also Tim Robbins is wonderful.

The story has everything: it's very sensitive and it shows some aspects of prison that aren't shown in other prison movies. It think (but I'm not sure because I have never been in prison) it gives a unique, but realistic view on the prison life and the many feelings prisoners are confronted with doing their time. The example of very tragic but so true I think. The guy has been his whole life in prison, that's the only life he knows and when he is released, he doesn't know how to built up a life in the real world because the world he know before prison doesn't exist anymore.

Frank Darabont proves he is a remarkable director and that he is made for directing prison-movies. ""The Green Mile"" is also an excellent and touching prison drama. It almost unbelievable that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" didn't won any Academy Award. But of course you can't deny that fact that the competition was fierce that year with also ""Forrest Gump"" in the running.

Highly recommendable prison-drama with great acting performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

"I watched the Shawshank Redemption.

I went on to the message board seeing many threads about it being overrated. I told myself that I shouldn't be surprised since it is Number 2 on the Top 250, quite an honor indeed.

So times passes...and I think about it. I see the movie again on Showtime, a movie channel.

...and after it is over for a second time, I think, ""This movie is flawless."" The acting, the direction, the pace, the adaption, the music, the set, the cinematography, the script...flawless? This is what I was telling myself.

This is a claim that I, myself, think is pretty crazy...but I think the reason the Shawshank Redemption is looked down upon is because it is flawless.

And even if that isn't true, that is how I feel about it.

"This is not the best film of all time, and not even Tim Robbins's best performance of all time. That would go to ""Arington Road."" Tim's third best performance of all time? Anything else, as these are his only two good film.

Morgan Freeman (ex-Easy Reader, The Electric Company) has turned in countless performances better than this one (Glory is an obvious one), and the rest of the cast of 'Shawshank' doesn't even stand out. I didn't even know Bill Sadler (who is in a lot of films) was in this film and couldn't even find the character he played.

Let's get the plot out of the way: Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is imprisoned for a murder he says he didn't commit. Redding (Freeman) is the wise old lifer who mentors and befriends Andy. The warden, for whom Andy works, is corrupt. The action results from this circumstance, but the focus is on the human and social dynamics of prison. The supporting cast was far too stereotypical, and the plot twists all very predictable. Nevertheless, the film was well-acted, well-shot, and fun to watch. It did not, however, move the earth.

To rank this film above From Here To Eternity, put it on a par with Casablanca and Gone With The Wind, and to have it leaving other classics like Ben Hur, On The Waterfront, and even Rocky in the dust is a bit much.

Shawshank's other main flaw is that it is a bit too political in its portrayal of corrupt conservatives in power.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic triumph that tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully imprisoned for murder. The film expertly explores themes of hope, friendship, and perseverance in the face of adversity. Tim Robbins delivers a powerful performance as Dufresne, while Morgan Freeman's narration adds an extra layer of depth to the already rich storytelling. Director Frank Darabont's attention to detail and masterful pacing keep the audience engaged from start to finish. The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film that continues to captivate audiences nearly three decades after its release.",5
"The attentive ear receives the sound from the instructive tongue, and the mysteries of ancient and accepted universal truths are lodged in the repository of faithful breasts. Cast and crew are at their best. The writer is indeed sublime.

The lapse of time, the ruthless hand of ignorance and the devastations of mankind laid waste to many a life and destroyed many valuable monuments of antiquity on which the utmost exertion of human genius is found and employed by Stephen King.

He came from a venerable teacher and is one of the many who are gratefully taught who will perpetually provide importance to print and film institutions for a very long time. Thank you kindly. This movie makes me feel what I feel when I feel it in the several scenes remembered from the past that keeps you moving forward and beyond with hope. Friendship and camaraderie continues and grows internationally throughout a global pandemic and beyond time in space travels finding the supreme architect of the universe. SMIB.",10
"I have nothing but praise for THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. It is touching, high-spirited and full of motivation. Tim Robbins plays a banker who is wrongly convicted of the murders of his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to life in prison and eventually befriends another lifer (played by Morgan Freeman in a powerful role) who has just been denied parole. It may sound like a simple story, but Frank Darabont's direction, along with endearing performances and a cheerful climax, makes the film so energetic and magical. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a breath-taking masterpiece.

"One can't be involved with IMDb without hearing, seeing, reading such a lot about this ""epic"". It has been top of the ratings since forever, and the user-reviews are superlatives-on-steroids! But can I really have rated 40 or 50 or more that are 8, 9 or 10? Yep! ie - Braveheart, ""Legends of the Fall"".

I saw the trailers, and wasn't really impressed - just another US jail pic? So I read some reviews, and saw other clips. Eventually, the local DVD shop had it on a super special, 3 disc set AND the complete script in a book, all for just $5! gosh, the book would have cost that much for the paper? So I doubt if Castle Rock, or Columbia or anyone involved in making it, got a single cent?

So I started with disc 3, boring pseudo-interviews with the main actors. Didn't learn much there, and the ""behind the scenes"" clip was only 9 minutes and not very informative, so, to disc 2 and eventually watched the actual film. By now I'm a bit overloaded with superlatives. But then thought about the tiny flaws, ie, Robbins as the main character Andy. Insipid, unconvincing? maybe, doesn't come across as either an innocent inmate, nor as a super clever. Norton the warden looks and sounds more like a small-town bank manager and acts like a modern big city corrupt banker? Hadley, the awful captain of the guard looks more like a ""upwardly mobile professional""?The other inmates are forgettable (except Brooks, the OLD guy). The ""get busy living or get busy dying"" scene confuses me, that is what I call a ""sillyism"". It means whatever you want it to mean.

I note that there is almost zero female participation? Well, it's a jail story of course, not much room for skirts. On my rating system, I gave it a 1 out 2 for the story, 1.5 out of 2 for the character definitions, 1.5 out 2 for the acting (Freeman is great of course), 2 for the filming, I kept noticing the colours and contrasts even in the dull setting, and only 1 more for the directing and production. 0 for special scenes! then 1 more for the dvds!

disc 1 also has a commentary by Frank Darabont, which didn't really add much. But he does comment on the question of how the poster got put back up after the escape! ""Get over it, it's movie"" True. His chapter in the booklet told everything, including why various scenes had not been shot ""mutatis mutandis"" (look it up!)",9
"The day Hollywood tries to remake this, will be the day I never watch another film. It was wrenched and probably an understatement they tried it with ""Jacobs Ladder."" This movie is a gripping, well told story, that can't be touched. It is one of my all time favorite movies! If you have never watched it go do so now! Very few movies even come close to it's caliber. It is hard to find a single thing wrong with this All-time classic! I should have wrote this review years ago. I saw it at a very young age and was mesmerized. This is one film that truly deserves all the high ratings! I love the narration and everything that went into it. 10/10 stars.",10
"What words can describe such a great film as this . Limitless yet I only need one to compare this film to da Vinci's Monalisa, with such art that the generations to come will still be talking about this film , dissecting it to see what worked for many of us cinema bugs..Tim Robbins' greatest role is here in this film , unsurpassed and for Morgan Freeman , the thunder who never strikes twice at the same place , it is also here. What will you do if you were convicted of a crime you did not commit ask yourself ? I for one, most likely would not have survived as long as Jake and the bird, or any of the wayward pack , yeah boy, do we admire them for their tenacity against the abusive guards, and please remember that this film is set on an era where the inmates and the internal guvs are not as thuggish like it is now for the last 25 years and so, maybe if retold in the modern settings no one would have survived , escaped , got pardoned and let alone rebuild their lives. It is as touching as it can be , as marvelous as real gold in your hands and as clever as you would like it to be. Definitely in my to watch again and again list.",10
"This is my perception of the entire film. As long as people exist in society, they will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. Of course, there are good and bad, but these are not the content we want to entangle. What really should be done is that no matter what, you and I will not be the former self.",5
This movie will go down as one of the greats. A work of art in it's genre.,10
This movie is horrible compared to great movies like casper. Any one reading this would be better off not watching it and instead watching spider man 3,9
"Fantastic from start to finish. Quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen, every aspect of it is perfect. Never loses its magic even after rewatching it. Fully deserving of its reputation as a masterpiece of cinema.",10
"I swear this movie was narrated by God, and by God I mean Morgan Freeman. When I found out Shawshank Redemption was a movie based off a Stephen King book, I expected a creepy horror movie, sort of like The Shinning. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast deliver in one of the greatest films ever made in history, at least according to IMDb, it was ranked number one. So how does one review possibly the best movie ever made?

The first time I watched Shawshank Redemption I wasn't really impressed, but when I saw it ranked atop the leader board on IMDb, I watched it again, and I agreed with its place. This movie was absolutely fantastic. The story flows and connects really well. The characters are lovable and important to the overall story and by the end it made me just go, ""wow that was awesome.""

This is a story of a man named Andy Dufresne who was convicted for the murder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. When Dufresne arrives in Shawshank he keeps a low profile but struggles with what one would call normal prison problems. He then uses his intelligence of the business world to get on the good side of the guards and the warden. He makes the warden really wealthy and prison life becomes simpler. Then the story develops from there and it is rather complex, but I won't give too much away.

I have to start with a few flaws I saw in this movie. The story was a bit slow with a lot of scenes or stories within the major story taking place. In the beginning Andy had problems with the perverts of the prison, or Andy playing the music over the speakers of the prison etc. A few of these stories were pointless and just made me think, ""Why?"" Some were definitely amusing but it is only a small gripe. Maybe if I watch it again I will appreciate them more, but for now it just dragged the story if you ask me. A second problem, and this really bugged me, was the fact that Andy Dufresne entered the prison in 1947 and left in 1966. That is a 19 year period. For a story to last 19 years is not a problem at all, but the fact that the characters do not age annoyed me a lot. Morgan Freeman was supposed to be in his 40s at the start. Now it doesn't matter what decade it is in real life, Morgan Freeman always looks old and wise. And by the end, Freeman didn't really age at all. Sure maybe a gray hair or two, but that was it. Dufresne looked the exact same and so did the Warden. Now some might ask why 19 year storyline but it makes sense if you actually see the movie. The director could have easily added some wrinkles, white hair, something, but there was nothing and it didn't make the time span believable. When Freeman narrates it's 1966 I didn't really believe it. Little details like that are things I can overlook because it is such a fantastic movie but small things like that make an awesome movie a classic movie.

The major strength of the movie, in my opinion, is the characters. Dufresne, Red, the warden are the main characters so obviously they will have complexity and lovability, but even smaller characters like Brooks are still important. Brooks showed the prisoner who spends his life in prison and knows nothing else. He is a minor character but he made me think of prison life and prisoners themselves. When he got out of prison he didn't know what to do, he even wanted to stay. He had a minor role with a big impact. Even when he is gone he is remembered and mentioned many times.

I really don't remember his name but the character who was the stereotypical 60s man and resembled Elvis was possibly the most important character of all (I'm just going to call him Elvis.). To save spoilers I will only hit the tip of the iceberg. The main story connects with the minor stories told throughout the movie really well but the all seemed pointless until Elvis shows up in Shawshank. He gives Dufresne what he needs and makes the warden put on his evil pants. Basically, he is the turning point of the story and makes it relevant. If you saw the movie you will know exactly what I mean, and if you haven't then go see it so you aren't completely lost.

Now the ending was absolutely phenomenal. Throughout the entire move I was thinking what the point was and where it was going, but by the end it is so surprising and personally I thought it was unexpected. It makes you appreciate the idea of storytelling and keeping an audience interested and when I watched it a second time it was one of those times when you think, ""Why didn't I see this coming?"" I love it when movie do that because it makes me think and if a movie makes me think it means I am interested and it does its job of being a good movie.

Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a classic, possibly one of the best of all time. Do I think it deserves number one on IMDb's list? No, absolutely not but it should be in the top 10. A bit of a slow start to an amazing story that connects really well, a cast of characters portrayed in depth and detail, and an ending that will possibly blow your mind all form together to form on of, but not the best, movie of all time and without a shadow of a doubt gets the WillyT seal of approval. See this movie ASAP.",10
"One of the best movies ever made. The ending truly is something most people love about this one, me included.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about personal disaster, misery, impossible difficulties, and eventual triumph. In other words, it's about life.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a young banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sent to the Shawshank Prison in Maine for life. There he meets Red, an older con played by Morgan Freeman. From there on, the movie is viewed through the eyes of Red, and Freeman's moving commentary surfaces during key points in the flick. Most of the movie is about the friendship between Andy and Red, and the different travails they encounter. The two learn about the meaning of hope, and how one must keep going despite the odds.

All this sounds pretty pat and boring, but the movie most assuredly is not. It has a brilliant mixture of brutal violence, gentle lyricism and uplifting moments coming from the most unusual of places. This could only work with a top-notch group of actors. The inhuman actions of Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) are enough to turn your head from the screen. This is tempered by the relaxed friendship between Freeman and Robbins, as well as the camaraderie inside Red's group; William Sadler as the stuttering Heywood is terrific. James Whitmore is touching as Brooks, the oldest inmate who is so used to prison life that he can't leave. Gil Bellows (Tommy) has a small but pivotal role; his superb performance changes the momentum of the entire movie. And the triumvirate of Brown, Mark Rolston (Bogs), and Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) set the tone of evil in the prison that only the wiles of Andy and the compassion of Red can surmount.

Some critics say that the movie is too slow. It's slow like a baseball game; its leisurely pace is belied by the amount of strategy underneath. An important moment happens in almost every scene, whether it's Brooks crying, Red making a joke, or Andy slyly getting the best of the system, the end gradually creeps up on us until the surprising, heartwarming finale. The last scene is one of incredible cinematic restraint; the camera actually pulls away from the action, preventing us from seeing the expressions on the characters' faces. We strain to see, not because we need to know what they are feeling--we already know. We just want to see as much as we can because it is so wonderful.

I haven't said much about what happens in the movie. Let's just say that it shows how one's mind and knowledge are more powerful than concrete walls, mental intimidation or physical force.

The Shawshank Redemption was not seen by as many people as it should have been, undoubtedly because of its un-sexy title. Don't be turned off. It's one of those movies that can draw you in and give you a lift, no matter what kind of mood you're in. It's one of the most satisfying movie experiences I've ever had. See it.",10
"I remember when I discovered this website now 20 years ago (Good Gravy where does time go?) I was surprised this was rated the #1 of all time. Still is to this day on this site. I thought it was a good movie but not my favorite ever. I don't even think it won any Oscars... though not that necessarily is saying much especially today.

What I took then and still do from watching the movie is hope. For anyone dealing with a bad job, marriage, friendship, or just a bad situation.",9
"-Great story. -Great characters and casting. -Great dialogue. -Great music. -Never got boring. -Very clever and uplifting message about hope.

-I can't think of any bad things about it except maybe the length but it's chock full-o-fun.",10
"First of all I am by no means a Shawshank hater nor I'm I here to troll the film or its fans for it being ranked this high on the IMDb top 250. Shawshank I must say is a rather enjoyable watch with a decent performance from Tim Robbins, a particular good one from Morgan Freeman, a decent storyline and a nice ending. However that said I would not put it anywhere near my top 50 movies list and I'm pretty sure I could name at least 30 films, twenty of which are not even ranked in the 250 that are IMO way better than Shawshank in their use of story telling and making you study them in your head even after you've watched them many times. It would perhaps be safe to say that what ever it does for many other people it just didn't do for me. The story was fairly predictable from start to finish and although I did appreciate its ending I found it to be too much your typical Hollywood sort of ending where every things happy and all loose ends have been tied up etc. I've now seen this movie four times and I must say I still find it to be very overrated, when I see it voted number two of all time then I think of how there are so many other movies out there not even in the 250. Oh well I guess popularity polls can never be just the way one would like them to be. Overall I give The Shawshank Redemption 6/10 stars I would have given it a seven or a eight only with the amount of high votes and rankings its got over the years on this site, I just felt it wasn't in need of such charity. As stated above a very enjoyable prison drama but just nowhere near in the same league as The Godfather, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogies. But hey thats only my opinion and thats what makes us all different isn't it?",9
"A good film that says about friendship & hope. I would give it a rating of 8.5/10 and its worthy to get an IMDB rating of 8.4 to 8.8 but not at all 9.3/10.

I will recommend y'all who are reading this review to see this movie atleast once in your lifetime. Screenplay is also good. Acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was at the best.

So, my rating: 8/10",10
"And what a way to say it! Until this one, I have never before rated a movie 10. It is by all accounts the best movie I have ever seen. Frankly I felt a little bit bored by the story but suddenly it was as if the story had taken a turn and everything fell into place. The first two thirds of the movie started making perfect sense. Then it takes another turn, perfectly underlined by Morgan Freeman's marvellously confused expression being questioned by the warden. From this part on the movie is a bit more ordinary but still a beautiful drama.

The Marriage of Figaro has gotten new meaning.",10
"If you didn't select the film, then you have lived in vain",10
"For a long, long time I wondered what was really going on. 9.3 out of 10 possible points on the world's largest film database IMDb, even before classics like The Godfather Part 1 and 2 and leader of some best lists. Yet it's just about a convicted banker who befriends Morgan Freeman and gets used to his life as a prisoner in Shawshank men's prison. But there's a lot more to this film than the blue-eyed setting up of modern movie clichés.

For the crux of The Shawshank Redemption already lies in its ensemble. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as the leading men in their absolute prime as actors. Secondary characters that integrate ideally into the scenarios of the protagonists and all have essential functions as their companions. Villains that seem generic from today's point of view, but for those times were unparalleled in cruelty. All of these ingeniously written roles have a hand in the plot, none of them feeling superfluous at any point. Of course, the film's trump card is the chemistry between Robbin's character Andy and Freeman's Red. After an initial distance, the two grow closer and closer as the film progresses, and within the nearly 30 years over which the plot takes place, they become almost inseparable. A down-to-earth and simple male friendship, where both of them share a terrible fate. How the two manage to carry each other through the cold harshness of prison life is gripping to follow. The individual scenes mainly belong to Robbin's Andy. This one is characterized by Red's over-voice and while this movie tool works in very few cases, it's a bull's eye here. It's not for nothing that Freeman's voice is considered iconic to this day. You have from the start that a man is telling his friend's story. Freeman's screen time suffers a bit as a result, but it doesn't take anything away from what is arguably the best performance of his career. Robbins delivers the much quieter and subtler performance, while Freeman excels in empathetic and even comedic monologues and dialogue at times. The rest of the cast adds to an all-around perfect ensemble performance. Foremost among them is Bob Gunton as the corrupt Warden Norton, under whose hypocritical posturing as a sensible Christian lurks a malicious layer that lends the film some (necessary) devastation.

Whether The Shawshank Redemption is really the best film of all time is debatable. However, one thing can't be denied: From an objective point of view, it is without major weaknesses. If anything, the slightly pathetic and conventional ending actually fits seamlessly with the previous plot. In this respect, this is perhaps a point of criticism, but merely one without much significance. Otherwise, it's a film that still did a lot to me at 22 years old, even 27 years later. The sensations of pain, shock and happiness regularly catch up with you. Despite its epic running length and slow build, the film is always entertaining and engaging, and it's also beautifully directed and photographed. Hard to find any flaws here.",10
"Going to prison is never easy and almost an unimaginable experience for most people. It's even worse if you are sentenced for fifty years despite being innocent.

Shawshank Redemption is an incredible movie. Not only because of its fantastic narration and storytelling technique. Not only because of the emotional yet inspirational performances put on by each and every actor/actress. Not even the spectacular filming and perfect settings. No, what makes Shawshank Redemption a truly excellent film is the complete story and the very relatable tale that is the life of Andy Dufresne.

This movie focuses on the lives of minor characters, life in and out of prison, and how the system has changed so many men and women drastically. And it's these individual stories that make Andy's even more special. He was able to stay strong, to manage without friends or support in the worst times. He was a man no one would have looked at twice. No one special. Just another person like you and me. Yet, his story is one that we can all imagine ourselves in. Where bad circumstances meet inexplicable motives, and it's being capable of imagining ourselves in Andy's shoes that makes Shawshank Redemption such a beautiful movie.

This movie stands for a lot of things. Love, respect, peace and friendship among other things. More so than the rest, Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope. Having faith in the future, secretly knowing good will overcome bad.

No one knows what our future holds. But if we could all live like Andy, optimistic and ever so kind in the most dire of situations, holding up true justice, this world would be a better place.",10
What can I say about this that hasn't already been said... Maybe the greatest movie ever?,9
"First of all, as I said above, the film depicts some timeless themes. As long as someone exists, as long as people still exist in the social structure in the form of independent individuals, then these themes will never be outdated and will always be worth pondering and discussing. Moreover, the film was completed in the 1990s, and the old shooting and performance techniques were completely eliminated at the time. So there is no ubiquitous deliberate and artificial in the old movie. It looks natural and convincing as a whole - although it must obviously be classified as a romantic genre.",10
"One of the best movies l've ever seen.

Highly recommended !",10
"Incredible to think that, like ""It's A Wonderful Life"", this film did not do well when it was released. The name, plus the fact it is a prison movie, plus the heavyweight tag-line, just didn't capture people's imagination. With its release on video and word-of-mouth, something changed, and now it is widely considered one of the greatest films of all time.

The reason is simple: from start to finish, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is about as close to perfect as a film like this comes. The best adaption Frank Darabont has made from a Stephen King story, despite a couple of liberties taken (most notably, Red is not a black American, but a white Irishman in King's original), the whole thing works so well, you would not change a single detail! It is crafted impeccably; every scene is a masterpiece, and the performance from every single person involved is spot-on. An epic tale that works on any level you want it to; a simple prison drama, an examination of political corruption, a religious allegory, and so much in between; like ""Lord Of The Rings"", the metaphor is practically endless.

Perhaps it is because of this fact that so many people return to this film; it doesn't matter what time of life you see it, what you are going through, or how you choose to accept the film, it will always offer you something. That really is quite special. A story of hope that can be genuinely life-changing, and life-affirming. A gem of a movie",10
"For a movie about a subject as broad and powerful as prison, this movie felt decidedly flat; there were ""bad"" guys and ""good"" guys and no-one in between. It follows a familiar trajectory and in my opinion, does not achieve anythign new on the cinematic or storytelling front. The sotry itself? Well, its simple feel-good melodrama. As hard as this might be to imagine, life in the prison is idealized. It's a stereotypical American story of righteous triumph that does little to stir emotions or provoke thought.",9
"If there were any actor I would choose to narrate my life. It would be Morgan Freeman. Shawshank Redemption stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a lawyer who gets framed for killing his ex wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank to where he meets Morgan Freeman and the two become friends. This is one of those movies where its good from start to finish that made me want to watch this movie again. This is the godfather of all prison movies. There are some prison movies that are great to watch, but nothing will ever come nowhere near as this. This is one of those prison movies where I felt bad for the prisoners and I also liked them as the movie progresses. Maybe not all of them, but the ones they focus on that's a different story. Shawshank Redemption is an adaptation of a Stephen King book and its fun to see a Stephen King book that doesn't involve a supernatural force being transformed into a movie. I'm not a big fan of prison movies because some of them try too hard to make us feel sympathetic towards the main character, but this one doesn't. It focuses on Andy who is shy at first, but as time passes he makes friends and he becomes more and more confident. And it shows that we as an audience actually and physically care about him that its not shoved in our faces where we can relate to him in some way. It's got heart and soul with fantastic acting, directing, music, and a script that's not rushed or a scene was thrown so it can add drama or intensity to it. The movie is two and a half hours long by the way, but it was so great and well written that I forgot I was watching a two and a half hour movie. What I liked about it was it wasn't trying to be the next big hit or be the next blockbuster. It told a beginning, middle, and an end that flowed perfectly that didn't feel pressured by Stephen King or Warner Bros. Everyone involved in Shawshank Redemption took Stephen King's book, sat down and all agreed that this is how we should make it, and that's all you need.",10
Well pure plain movie. Boring Dull No story at all. Plz I request all to rate 1 🌟 to movie so others don't waste their time by influence by wrong rating.,9
"Okay, couldn't Morgan Freeman have at least TIED with Tom Hanks for that Best Actor Oscar? This film works on so many levels. Freedom, innocence, aging, prejudice, masculinity. My only ""but"" is this: Having seen the television show 'OZ,' it seems that in prison the lines of good and bad, friend or foe, are very blurred. In this movie, they seem a little too cut-and-dry. Other than that, I can't think of a single other critique, nor can I come up with any other words to do it justice. If I had to pick from either this film or ""The Godfather"" only, it'd be this, hands down!",6
"What can you say that others haven't said about this film? (I notice there are 200 pages of comments). I'll try this: It is, quite simply, the best movie ever made. I have never seen a list of best films that didn't include it, and don't expect to until I'm very old.

You can't go far wrong with great actors in a great story; add in great direction and great cinematography, and you have a classic. For me to say that a movie is better than 'Casablanca' is quite something, but this is it. There aren't many films that have had their titles changed either, but down the years this one has simply become known as ""Shawshank"".

Just a final note to mention James Whitmore, often overlooked in all the praise that has been heaped on the other leads. How he didn't win a gong for his portrayal of the prison librarian I will never know. Yet another inexplicable miss by the Academy.",10
One of my favorite movies. It truly leaves you thinking for weeks after watching this absolutely amazing movie. This movie is great since the very beginning.,10
"Did you know this movie flopped during its first release, this goes to show how fickle we humans are and how the media really drives our thinking.

A gem of a movie, starts slow and then slowly grows on you and then bang, probably one of the best endings in movie history. This movie explores so many aspects of our society, such as why giving someone a death sentence is not good, the instituion of prison and if your on it long enough it's the outside world that becomes your biggest fear. The corruption of prison staff and finally how a certain spends his time during prison breaks.

They should this movie in schools (to kids of a certain of course), might make them realise what it's really like to be in prison.

Every actor in this movie was excellent, the story was precise, options were high and the final 15 mins will take the viewer into a state of euphoria.",8
I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll ever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film. All the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story captures you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the final credits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And that nothing is black and white. But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind.,5
"I have watched this film many times and I never feel bored. It is a kind of film that make you feel that human has the potential to go through all kinds of suffering. It makes you feel the strength within human spirit and hope that never dies. After you see what the main character did, you come and look at your life and find that it is not that hard, we can keep on trying a little more. Impossible things can be possible. Spirit doesn't have to be broken by cruelty or hardship.

When I watched it, I would think ""look at him, for all those years of being imprisoned without doing wrong, for all those times of going through evil people that treat him harshly, this man never gives up fighting, never give up hoping and trying to find his freedom, and he made it, and his strength even brought back the life and hope of another person"" Then, I would think...why don't I be more patient and keep trying with my life, keep trying for my dream. Just do it again and again, and one day I will get to where I want to be.

Excellent film in every element of it. It's exciting, touching, and moving. Highly recommended for all who have not watched. It's a must-see for everyone.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece that has been endlessly discussed and praised since its release in 1994, and with good reason. This film, based on a Stephen King novella, is a timeless story of hope, friendship, and the enduring human spirit.

The film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (played brilliantly by Tim Robbins), a man who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sent to the Shawshank State Penitentiary. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who helps him navigate the harsh realities of prison life.

At its core, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about the power of human connection and the importance of hope. Despite the bleak setting of a prison, the film is filled with moments of humor, warmth, and heart that make it a truly unforgettable experience.

Director Frank Darabont's masterful storytelling is on full display here, as he expertly weaves together a narrative that is both poignant and gripping. The cinematography and score are also standout elements, adding to the film's emotional resonance.

While The Shawshank Redemption is a film that has been discussed and analyzed countless times, it still manages to surprise and delight with its lesser-known strengths. For example, the film's commentary on the American justice system and the way it treats its prisoners is just as relevant today as it was when the film was released nearly 30 years ago.

Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic gem that deserves all of the praise it has received over the years. It's a film that never fails to move, inspire, and uplift, and it's one that should be seen by anyone who appreciates the power of storytelling and the resilience of the human spirit.",9
"I've seen this movie only once, and I think that's the main reason why I like this movie very much. I have not been able to forget it. I has remained in my mind ever since I saw it. When I saw this movie, it made a tremendous impact on me. This is a beautiful movie about triumph and the power of friendship. Among other things, this movie contains terrific performances. Perhaps the best performance is that of the great Morgan Freeman, as a prison inmate. And of course, Tim Robbins also shines, playing the lead character. There are so many memorable scenes in this movie. One particular scene that stands out is the moment when Robbins' character breaks free, and you see him standing in the rain, shirtless and with his arms stretched out. But what is the most memorable scene is the ending--a fitting ending to this touching and haunting story. If you haven't seen this movie, definitely do so. This movie is so powerful that you only need to see once for it to move you. This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever.",7
"The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the finest work from Morgan Freeman, and up-holds as one of my favourite ""prison"" movies. A movie that walked out with zero Oscars in the 1994 Academy Awards and to earn it's place on top of the two-fifty, it's very impressive. They're some very memorable quotes, characters, stages and scenes in this movie that'll never be forgotten. It shows the value of friend-ship, a accurate display of what prison is like and very good acting. The thought of The Shawshank Redemption not winning an Oscar for its acting, writing or whatever is way beyond me. The Shawshank Redemption in my eyes is no solid masterpiece, but the hate and bash it gets feels totally unacceptable. A very solid movie with a suitable duration and some powerfully moving emotional scenes. One for everyone to see.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a really good movie, great written with a great story, a good cast and all in all a very good ""harmony"". But in my opinion it isn't the best movie ever made and there are some movies I rather put on Number 1 of the IMDb Top 250 List. Top 10 for sure, but not the best film I have ever seen in my life...",10
This move was released in earlier 90s and still gives you a lot of inspirational prospects!,9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the greatest piece of filmmaking in the history of cinema; it is the best story ever manifested on film. The way the characters remarkably draw you in to all of their beautiful idiosyncrasies is something to behold. This 1994 masterpiece evokes the entire emotional spectrum out of you throughout its totality. Morgan Freeman got the nomination he deserved but Tim Robbins not receiving one is a shame. Everybody in the world has to watch this movie at least once in their lives. From the beautiful cinematography, screenplay, and story to just its overall cinematic perfection; ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the gem of gems.",9
"Fear makes you a prisoner, hope makes you a freeman.",9
"This Movie, is, with out a doubt. one of the best movies ever made. Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman are unforgettable in this classic.

Andy Durfrein(Robbins) is a banker and is accused of murdering his wife. after being sent to jail he ends up in Shawshank. when Red(freeman) first lays eye's on Andy he knows he is different, and so is this movie. it is so powerful and unforgettable.

although it was released in the same year as other classic's, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction(my fav movie) it is still are masterpiece in its own right. by far Robbins best performance, it deserves nothing less than 10/10

the Shawshank Redemption is a Must See for any Movie Goer.

GO SEE IT!",9
"After watching this film, I think good faith is important. When others don't believe him, he still doesn't give in. Still have a good yearning for life. Do what you want to be, such as the title of the film also redeem the people around him",10
"The relentless pursuit of freedom is my perception of the whole film. People, as long as they exist in society, will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. There are good and bad things, but that's not what we're going to struggle with. Really should go to pinch, is that no matter how, you and I will not be the previous self.",10
"No you're not hallucinating, this film is underrated! How is it underrated? According to dumb users on IMDB ""Lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring"" is better!

It starts off with Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) a banker in his car with a gun. His wife is sleeping with another man. Next scene is Andy defending himself but he gets life in jail at the end of the scene. Andy makes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman, also narrator). Andy is someone who really hopes to get out but Red is afraid of getting to used to living behind bars.

It turns out to be one of the best films ever. People who haven't seen it say ""Its just a jail film"" Its not! When they end up watching it they find out its not just a jail film. Another thing its unpredictable which is what you expect when you see a film.

Nobody cannot like this film! I could go on forever about the reasons why this film is so good, just watch it. 10 out of 10",10
"Such an amazing film Shawshank encompasses, it will show how men can be hopeful and and dreams can became true. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.",10
"Great movie but number 2 all time? Get real. Morgan Freeman is great, Tim Robbins is at his pinnacle and the screenplay keeps things interesting throughout. At times the direction is a bit klunky, and not all of the supporting characters are believable. It certainly deserves a place in the 100 top movies, but not in the top 50.",10
"A DVD to own because you could watch it several times. Inspirational with relatable characters to root for, who wouldn't love this legendary drama with this talented cast!!",10
"So for a great movie i provide you with a simple and short review. This is a film worth a watch with amazing story-line, drama and performance. Morgan Freeman made it up as a cast.

But i can not say that this is a best or even a better movie at all. It is a usually movie with a catchy, just and simple plot. This film is equipped with nice and beautiful plus emotional and interesting plot with amazing direction.

So this is a movie that appeals nearly everyone, and that is why it is so over-rated but that should not mean it is a all time best movie. It is a simple and honest movie which is great but yes over-rated.",6
"''Hope is the good thing, maybe the best thing, and no good things ever dies'', ''I was the honest man out there, I turned crook after coming to prison'', these are some of the best lines that you come across while watching 1994's ''Shawshank Redemption''.

This English Drama revolves around the character of Andy Dufresne an innocent banker convicted for murdering his wife and her boyfriend, he is sent to the Shawshank Jail to spend his rest of life, and there he finds a friend, Red, who provides him a rock hammer for some indefinite and unknown reason, the speciality of Andy was that he always kept him busy with some work, that he often says, ''Get busy living or get busy dying'', he begin as the financial adviser for the prison guards and continue to be the shape changer of the prison library, but when he realizes that some dark things happening in that penitentiary he try to bring them to light but before he does that he is sent to the solitary confinement, after his release from that confinement he speaks with Red about having the hope and tells about his dreams, that where he want to spend last days of his life and takes the promise from him that if Red get released from the imprisonment he asked him to meet him again, after the day of their conversation Andy find missed from his jail and had escaped through the sewage pipe, but Andy disguise himself in other name and set free from the clutches of cops along with submitting the records about the corruption and the inhuman activities that are seen in Shawshank jail, Red get released after his 40 years of imprisonment and succeeds in keeping his promise to Andy.

This movie is neatly crafted by its maker; each character in the play gets its own introduction and style of presenting, the portrayal of the roles like Andy, Red and Brooks are finely shown, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are brilliant in their act, that artistic way of presenting the plot and the dialogues adds extra weightage to the movie, it's the best made movie.",10
"This is a wonderful movie, thanks to Tim Robbins. His role as Andy Dufresne is just amazing! I usually don't watch prison films but this one just pulls you in and doesnt let go until the end. Morgan Freeman is very good in this but I still think it was Robbins that clinched it as a top rated movie. I can't believe horror writer Stephen King came up with the story for this. What an amazing man! Now I see why they had to slip Rita Hayworth into the movie. I wonder how she'd respond to Morgan's little comment about her when they were watching ""Gilda""? :-) If you havent seen this film, please do ASAP.. it's worth it!",10
"I am neither a Stephen King nor a prison movie fan, so had not bothered to watch this film until recently... That was my loss.

Shawshank Redemption, like all great movies, falls into no category. It defines its own space. It is an incredible story woven across time and between two characters. It is about Spirit and Justice. And friendship.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins should have shared Best Actor Oscars for this film.

I hate to admit it, but Stephen King has talent.",9
"You can not find even a moment that bothers you or you may say it can be removed, not even one second of it. And well, despite being all necessary to the plot, you enjoy it all. Sanity in story telling is at it's top, Dialogues are priceless and actors performance is brilliant(hats down to Morgan Freeman or the lovely Red, Thank you Sir for making this memorable experience available for us all). That scene with beers on the roof and after that when they talked about it in prison dining were simply reflection of the highest level of acting and plot development I have ever seen. I am Writing this review after watching this movie for more than fifty times in different occasions, having different moods and with different friends. And every time this movie took me out of my life to be consumed in Shawshank Prison trying to find a way to redemption alongside with Andy and Red,an excellent experience of pure enjoyment. I am no expert or critic reviewer but simply one can say something with this characteristics is a rare thing. I haven't yet met anyone who has watched it and didn't enjoyed it. This movie is a true masterpiece that deserves to be at the top.",10
I have seen this movie 1o times. Great Movie to Watch!,8
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever, and the best performance Morgan Freeman has delievered. I must say that Morgan Freeman has to be one of the best actors of all-time. He is an intelligent actor who does intelligent movies like Glory, Se7en, Unforgiven and Driving Miss Daisy. Tim Robbins also delievered an excellent performance. He played Andy Dufresne, a city banker who is wrongfully accused of killing his wife and her lover. He is recieved a double life sentence for the crime, and is sent to Shawshank prison in 1947. Andy forms a friendship with the man who knows how to get things around there, Red, played by Morgan Freeman. I won't tell anymore about the movie, but i will say at how amazed i was at this film. It was so well done. This is a must see. It is worth every penny of your money when you rent this film, if you do. When you see this movie, also, you will know why i say it it Morgan Freeman's best performance to date.

I give it ***** out of ***** stars.",9
"I remember years back when I was about 12 years old and had not seen many mature films like this my mum found this on the guide and told me to watch it. My mum isn't a huge film person but she was sure I would love this film despite the fact that my favourite films at the time were out there comedies like ""scary movie"" or ""hot fuzz"" (which I still think is a fantastic film). So as a kid who was extremely curious about what ""great films"" actually were and knowing that this film was highly regarded, I was very happy to sit down and watch a two hour prison drama.

Never in my entire life had I been drawn to the screen quite as much as was watching the shawshank redemption, I was invested completely from start to end. As the credits began to roll I knew it was the greatest film I had ever seen, and I even remember stating to my mum who was doing the ironing at the time.

To this day which I only half a decade of excessive film watching later it is still by far the best film I have ever seen and the one which means most to me. I don't think I need to go into why because there are already thousands of reviews out here which will go into far more depth and cover more things than mine ever could. Just know that if you haven't watched it then make sure you do whatever it takes to see the masterpiece whenever you get the chance to. For me and clearly many others this is the greatest film of all time.",10
"I thought the protagonist of this movie is not the hero but Red. The hero is a man to inspire him. We saw the greater human drama in the heart of the Red. Then I thought the protagonist is Red This story is kind of complete story because of its construction of story. It's always that good story of movie has two lines of the story. One, the story around protagonist. Second, the story of a person who is encouraged by the hero's action, Since I am one of a movie story writer, I know that great movie story always has just that kind of construction. The being of the story, the hero looks like the protagonist. But while the story goes by we know the protagonist is the different person. The transition of the story is so beautiful. I admire that this story is one of the greatest stories of movie history. But because of having this is kind of a complete story I don't value this movie very much. Direction of this movie is the kind of too normal. If I get the complete story, I think that I wonnna make a characteristic direction movie. Then I can give the point as 9.0 Well... what a wonderful thing movie is! Aee you next! Sayonara, Sayonara, Sayonara.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption (9/10): Brilliantly written and amazing acting by Tim Robbins. He was living on a single thing i.e. HOPE! Never ever lost his calm:o My favorite dialogues : 1 . Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies 2. Get Busy Living or Get Busy dying.",9
"I have watched this movie countless times and I can't just get enough of it. I highly recommend the movie. If you have watched Prison Break, make sure to watch Shawshank Redemption.",10
"just read the title. Tough I think it's a pretty decent movie (but not as good as the Stephen King's novel) i just can't understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 (with the exception of the godfather). To be honest i don't even really think it should be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie. This is a political statement.",10
A unique story. Must Watch I really loved the movie💯,9
"An intelligent, resourceful man survives in a brutal prison during the 1950's and 60's. Emphasis on character development rather than enviroment place this film ahead of others in this genre. A fine example of the triumph-of-human-spirit-over-adversity theme. (Rating: A)",10
"As a super movie fan, I don't why I only watch this all the time high rated movie after 25 years. Anyway, the movie is heavy and the play is also a legend. With 20+ years going, more and more movie fans praised it as a fine god work which is well-deserved!

It becomes undoubtedly the classic in the classics. ""Dark Moon High Flying, as one of Chinese translations title, and I would say it can well explain everything. 20 years of hard work is just for freedom, a must-see inspiring movie for everyone.",9
This movie is just brilliant no other words needed,6
"This is my all-time favorite movie, tied with Good Will Hunting. What a clear and incredible experience i had trough this!! i'm still breathless.

This incredible film based on a short story by Stephen King (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption) shows the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an important banker who is convicted to life imprisonment, accused of the murderer of his wife and her lover; Dufresne then goes to the Shawshank prison where an incredible story of hope takes place!, he meets Ellis Boyd Redding, best known as Red (Morgan Freeman), also a life imprisonment convict who is well respected in the prison; Dufresne begin to demonstrate that he isn't an usual convict, gaining admiration and respect off the inmates, and maintaining the hope in a drab and corrupt prison.

It's incredible how the greatness of a human being can promote the most wonderful feelings in the people, and how a really strong character can maintain his values, principles and dreams amongst any situation. This movie touched my soul, gave me a clear and fresh feeling and is a daily guide to my life! It also demonstrate the importance of the reading, education and self improvement, challenges, perseverance in reaching goals, and love of the true meaning of life!.

The quality of the film is incredible; the directing of Frank Darabont is outstanding; Morgan Freeman is absolutely outstanding too!, Tim Robbins is excellent, their friends roles are touching: Heywood (William Sandler), Tommy (Gil Bellows) Brooks (James Whitmore); the prison guards, specially Warden Samuel Norton (Bub Gunton) and Captain Healey (Clancy Brown) have a good acting also.

A movie that is worth to buy and see forever, is the movie that touch your soul and left a sense of clearness, a movie to teach to your kids the importance of holding to what you really are, and to always, in any situation maintain the hope. 10/10 and my all time favorite!!",10
"I can assure you that this movie deserves its position at the top of IMDB's list.

That being said, I can also say that I really can't give it a ten out of ten. There are many movies that I can always watch, and this just isn't one of them. It is deep, meaningful, and it is also becoming a bit of a pop culture icon.

This is not good for it, and will only detract from younger viewers experience.

I can think of many movies with a powerful scene in them, that I saw references too outside of the film. Pop culture references are like little mini-spoilers. If you are young, and thinking of watching it, and you spend any amount of time on social media, be prepared for a let down.

I can't even look at the cover and keep a straight face. It's so meme-or-able.",10
"Don't listen to ANY negative reviews on this film. Just go out, and buy it. Yes, buy, not rent. Most people who didn't like this will tell you it's a ""fairy tale"" and ""cliched"", but you will not find a movie that moves you as much as this. This is the reason people see movies. The story is about a man sent to prison for the murder of his wife. He claims to be innocent, but we are never given any proof. Inside, he makes friends with many of the inmates and from that point on, what follows is one of the most brilliant and astounding films ever. Leonard Maltin said the movie was too long. Who cares? I was not bored through a single second of this movie. It held my interest for over 2 hours, and that's no small feat. I haven't read any other critic's reviews on this, and I don't have to. No matter what they say, nothing will ever make me change my mind that this is one of the best films ever made. They can hate it with a passion for all I care, at least us moviegoers know what we like. If you want to see a movie that will change your life, one of those movies that stay with you forever, then go get this. Extremely moving, gripping, sad, and cheerful, you HAVE to see this. From Tim Robbins standing in the rain with his arms stretched to the sky, to Morgan Freeman walking down a sandy stretch of deserted beach in the film's unforgettable ending, this movie truly touched me in a way few movies ever do. SEE THIS. On a scale of 1-10, you can't even rate this one.",10
"This is one of those movies every man should see before they die. I love this movie. The acting, the direction, etc. But the ending is one of the most vindicating and the most satisfying I've ever seen. Pure excellence.",10
"The film is instructive, makes you appreciate everything you have, you have to think a lot in the process. Such films are very well remembered the first time and you want to watch them periodically. With each viewing it becomes more and more interesting. If anyone else has not watched this movie, then I highly recommend watching it. I myself will review it until retirement, that's absolutely for sure!

Especially, even briefly, I will not talk about what this film is about, everything is clear from the title. Just take the time and see. I wish everyone a great mood and as many good pictures as possible! Thank you for attention))",9
"I watched this movie last night to remind myself how magnificent this movie was and will always be. This movie is very powerful, emotional, witty, noteworthy and magical at the ending. It tells a story about freedom and justice and I loved the Morgan Freeman's narration and what's crazy about that is I heard that Morgan narrated the whole movie before a frame was ever put. That's just a fun fact and tells everything about this movie. This is one of those movies that everyone will talk about and remember for the next Century till Infinity. Easily one of the greatest films of all time having one of the greatest actors ever in Morgan Freeman. Him and Tim Robbins's performance will always be legendary.",8

"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most successful Crime/Drama movies ever and with a outstanding cast and a story that has touched the hearts of generations and will still to this day. Andy Dufresne is a banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and he is found guilty and sent to Shawshank prison for life along the time he spends at prison he befriends Red a man who commited a crime in his youth and spends his life felling the guilt of his crimes and Andy and Red will form a bond that will help Andy in his attempt to escape the prison and be free Tim Robbins leads the cast as Andy Dufrense The wife killing banker who we follow along in his story at Shawshank along side him is Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red Redding a man who has worn the lookof prison life for to long and the prison life is all he knows and will ever know and he also narrates the story as well also in the cast is William Sadler as heywood, Bob Gunton as Warden Norton,Clancy Hadley, Gill Bellows as Tommy,James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen,Mark Rolston as Bogs Diamond and Jeffrey DeMunn as The D.A from 1946 this is a very soild cast and they blend well together, Director Frank Darabont has captured the King story and brought it to life and really gave it so much power and makes us follow a interesting story and he has brough every thing he had into the screenplay and the directing and the cinematography was just amazing in this movie and there is nothing to hate and the story is so moving. By far one of my favorite movies is The Shawshank Redemptiton and There are so many great parts some of my favorite quotes from the movie come from Red my favortite one is ""They send you here for life and that's exactly what they take"" another great quote is ""Get busy Living or get busy dying"" these are only two quotes and they are just so powerful the whole movie is just so iconic and it really just can resinate with any generation and we all can learn a lot from The Shawshank Redemptiton whether we have been to jail or not you learn how difficult life for a prisoner really is and the whole movie is iconic.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a simple but amazing film with an everlasting message. Although there's no action or special effects, this movie keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. You have friendships, difficulties, dreams and most importantly: you have hopes. All that Shawshank Redemption is about is ETERNAL HOPE! And I think this theme is what makes this movie so special. Not only you find something relatable (even though the circumstances that the characters are in probably have nothing to do with you), but you think about the message, about the movie. And after you watch it you feel motivated, even grateful for what you have. You feel hope. And that's exactly how you should feel because as the movie says ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""",10
"I was feeling a little discouraged the other day so I decided to put ""Old Faithful"" in the DVD player. Sure enough, after watching it--for who knows how many times--I felt inspired again. This movie is the best movie I've ever seen and maybe the best ever made. It's for anyone who needs to understand the power of hope--which means it's for everyone everywhere. I'm so proud it is the top movie on IMDb's Top 250, it sooo deserves it. I'm so glad it has touched others the way it touched me. If you haven't seen it--first of all, what planet are you on? lol--but seriously, go rent it. This is a movie that can change a life. If it doesn't do something to your insides, you probably don't have a pulse. I'm so grateful to Stephen King for writing it and to Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and the director and others for making it such a classic film. THIS is what movie-making was supposed to be.",9
"Wihthout a doubt this is one of my all time favorite movies and is probably the best Stephen King film.I had never heard of it until i saw the IMDb top 250.Better than The Godfather.I'm super glad this is #1 on the top 250.It has an amazing plot and is a movie that sends a lot of messages one being that institutionalization has a huge effect on people that are in prison for many years and they get used to it.When they leave they want to go back to the prison as it is their home. It is a shame it didn't win any awards at the Academy Awards.If I were on the panel deciding what movie should win Best Picture Oscar I would have picked The Shawshank Redemption which would have been a hard task as 2 other masterpieces Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction were also in the nominees.1994 must have been a really outstanding year in film.I wish I could give it 11 stars.This is a movie you have to see.It truly is a film that is for watching dozens of times and is a beauty all the time

"Outstanding. Never has a film gripped so powerfully before. Some films are great and hold you well enough, but this absolute powerhouse of a film keeps me glued, and is a great tribute to Hollywood, the great Stephen King short story, and of course a great tribute to all the things that make hope and freedom so wonderful. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his life, as Andy Dufresne. A strong-headed man who is sent to Shawshank prison, wrongfully accused of ""murdering his wife, and the fellow she was banging."" With that in mind, it is excruciatingly tense and powerful, as we watch Andy adapt to prison life, form a beautiful friendship with 'Red' the convict who knows how to get things, (played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, who in my opinion deserved to win the Best Actor Oscar) and of course see him handle himself around those out to get him, which spans from other prisoners to the warden, who he helps turn the prison into a business, due to his good experience as a banker, the occupation which he held before being convicted. But as the picture goes on, you can see the yearning to get out. He is a bird that has been caged wrongfully, and when you see how long he has been locked away for, even though he didn't do it it really makes for stunning and compelling viewing. The ending is beautifully scripted, and the mood is outstanding. Frank Darabont has created an exceptional film, with realistic talents and people we can care for. The stereotype of the prisoner is made into something better, and the overall experience of this film is magnificent, with fantastic memorable quotes, and an exchange of good to bad atmosphere, which at one point makes you feel good watching it, but then shows the awful atrocities and seriousness of the situation. This complex style of direction and storytelling is amazing, and the ending is top notch, I won't spoil this bit though. You wanna know how good it is? Then watch it and be dazzled by this truly remarkable film.

"On the surface level, the subject is run-of-the-mill, i.e. the torture meted out to some prison inmates. But it is the way this subject is handled, that's what makes this movie so unique and memorable. Andy Dufresne is the very heart and soul of the movie. It is the greatness, the uniqueness of his character that sets him apart from the other inmates, not to mention the fact that he is wrongly convicted. Tim Robbins is absolutely brilliant in his role. I believe this is what is supposed to mean an Academy Award winning performance. I have only seen him in another movie , 'Jacob's Ladder', which is one of the most bleak movies I have ever seen. 'Shawshank' has its bleak moments, scenes of violence and torture, but what saves them from being a little too much for viewing is the narration by Morgan Freeman's character. Two scenes, one in which Andy gets beat by some other prison inmates and the one which Tommy(Gil Bellows) is shot are, I think the most violent in the movie. But the violence is kept under control by Red's ensuing narration. It is that which also gives the movie an aura that this is the story of one man who, with his friendship with Andy, realizes that he still has life beyond the four walls of the prison and being a convict doesn't mean that he is bereft of human dignity. Morgan Freeman, as always, is perfect in his role. This is perhaps the best movie of Freeman's (except maybe 'Driving Miss Daisy'). The supporting cast is equally good, especially Gil Bellows, who gives a short but poignant performance. Good cinematography(sweeping images) and a good music score(especially the concerto Andy broadcasts across the entire prison) are some of the magical moments of the movie and what adds to its greatness. Worth every moment!",8
"I have made a point of watching IMDb Top 250 Movies for quite some time. Wasn't aware of such a list, until I stumbled across IMDb & realised I had seen all of Top 50 (Almost) while some movies remaining. But, I see why Shawshank Redemption is #1.

Writing review about the movie would be an injustice. The movie shows Human Relationship at its core, when opened to its core upon extreme adversaries. Watch this movie, not because it's #1 in IMDb Rating but because the 240 minutes would be the moments to reflect your whole life on.",10
"At the early stages of this film, when Andy arrived at the prison in a bus full of other prisoners, one of the guards told the new arrivals to discard their cell phones. Did I hear this incorrectly? Anyone knows that cell phones were not invented anywhere near 1947.

As for the film itself, I rarely score a '9' and the only '10' was 'Montenegro,' an American/Swedish co-production, black comedy made in the mid-80's. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as well as the warden (Frank Dunton) were superlative and the script was so good, one might think the story was based upon fact, whereas it is fictional.

A Yale (or was it Harvard?)law school study revealed that 7% of incarcerated inmates are innocent. One prominent attorney said that was an 'acceptable' percentile. I don't want him as my defense attorney.

I liked the ending. It doesn't leave the viewer hanging. While sanding his boat in working clothes, I'm sure Andy lived in a mansion above the Pacific Ocean. $377,000 was a lot of money in 1966.",10
Very nice tittle best Very nice tittle best Very nice tittle best,10
"I have heard that the movie is among the best and that is a must-watch.So,I decided to check if that is true. Believe me,the movie was just perfect.Not,only for its drama scenes and for the acting of Morgan Freeman,the movie clearly shown the power of hope and the meaning of freedom,described in a marvelous way.

Particularly,i loved the scene when Andy,the protagonist,tries to cheer up the prisoners by talking about the importance of hope and how it can help them survive and believe in a better word.Also,the movie shows through violent scenes how prisoners where turned into slaves,that couldn't feel for just as second...alive!

Both Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman played their role totally perfect,making themselves part of a cruel,dark jail!

After its tremendous ending I had no words.The movie had reached perfection and became enemy favorites.Finally,when I went to sleep I couldn't forget the magic of the film,that surrounded me and took me away...",10
"The prision movie is one of those rare genres where more or less every film turns out to be a winner (The Great Escape, Pappilon, Midnight Express), but The Shawshank Redemption of 1994 may well take its place as the best of them all. Frank Darabont's hugely impressive picture cuts a remarkable balance in paying attention to the harsh realities brutalities of prison life whilst also successfully conveying the power and determination of the human spirit.

Tim Robbins is Andy DeFrans, a banker sent to the maximum security Shawshank prison for life for the alleged murder of his wife and lover, where he strikes up a friendship with the seasoned convict Red (Morgan Freeman). The film has enjoyed huge popularity and acclaim since its surprisingly passive 1994 release (perhaps due to the attention surronding Forrest Gump) and almost certainly deserves its label as a contemporary classic; few films carry such a magnetic, absorbing and attentive pull. The result is something that not only ranks as great entertainment but a chance for the viewer themselves to enjoy and appreciate a first-class piece of screenwriting and film-making.",8
"I cannot understand why this movie is so highly rated. The Green Mile was better than this movie, by leaps and bounds. This movie was mildly pleasant at best. It has a typical happy ending. It has the kind of wrap up reminiscent of a romantic comedy. It doesn't seem very authentic, men in prison are miserable or unrelatable. The main characters truly come off as insane. No movie starring Morgan Freeman was every truly a great piece. He tries too hard to be profound, and it makes him look like a dumb smug ass. I don't have anything against him though. But he'll never be Denzel Washington. He's like bad luck. Maybe it's based on a book that was much better, haha!",10
"It has such a simple premise and story,but everything is done so perfectly that one cannot stop watching, an extremely masterful movie and practically a must watch of you have any interest in movies.",10
"Morgan Freeman is amazing in this movie like usual and Tim Robbins is amazing! It is set at a fast pace even though you would think not because it is about a guy who goes to jail! The Cinematography is just WOW! The scene where Tim Robbins is in the rain is amazing. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" The ending is just so wholesome and makes you feel so happy! The only thing that isn't just amazing in this movie are the characters, but they are still real good. INCREDIBLE MOVIE!",6
"I have only seen about a dozen films in a cinema setting in my life and this film was one of the many that I originally watched on Video. I watched it for the first time about five years ago having not previously heard of it before. I was swept away by the way the story unfolded and at the end I just felt as if my life had been uplifted by having watched it. Not in some life changing way but just being better than it was. I am not an idiot but I cannot adequately describe exactly how this film affected me, maybe I don't need to. I have watched a lot of the films in the IMDb top 250 and numerous that are not in the list and this is one of very few which I would watch again and again. Im not interested in the way it was made I just appreciate it for what it is. It is a masterpiece in the same way that a piece of music or a painting would be regarded and in my humble opinion deserves to be at the top of the pile in the IMDb top 250. It probably wont sort your problems out for you but it should make you think about whats important in life. One of the few conclusions that I personally came to was that it shows that the expression 'what goes around comes around' is in the film for all to see. In a nutshell the good and bad that people do have a way of coming back eventually to reward or penalise. The main characters in the film were either rewarded or penalised and real life isn't always that organised or fair. Anyway everybody has an opinion and if there is anybody out there that hasn't seen this film please watch it you might not like it but it is almost certain you will be affected by this film.",7
Loved this film. Has such a great message and the film is as good as the book. Watch and show your kids this film.,10
"I watched this movie maybe 5 times, but I can say it is the only movie I will watch without getting bored. You can understand that it is inevitable to succeed when you continue the things that are called really impossible without getting tired and bored even after years.",10
"It's common knowledge that this particular picture turned out to be a canon of a brilliantly made story! It shows how a person is able to overcome and pull through tons of arduous and backbreaking challenges in pursuit of his dreams. The main character was elaborating this escape route and finally got it! This movie is generally about rooting for justice and claiming rights. Stunning performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins made my heart melt!

One of the most legendary movies of all times!",10
"I saw this movie when it first came out 7-8 years ago and loved it. I was 15 at the time. Saw it again recently on TV and I didn't like it nearly as much. There's really not much to criticize, it's an excellent work, very well acted, nicely executed but it's just....idunno.....too plain and safe. Nothing really daring or new about it, and on second viewing many scenes seem needlessly melodramatic.

Still well worth seeing, but nowhere near the classic status that some reviewers here were quick to bestow upon it.",10
"I watched this movie about four years ago based on the high rating it was getting on this and other sites. The movie wasn't bad, and I liked the twist at the end. Overall though, the movie was rather average for me - your typical prison movie -- you know, we're in prison together, society done us wrong, us good, guards bad etc. The protagonist eventually escapes leaving behind some who helped. Warden bad. That's about it. Have I missed something?",10
(The Shawshank Redemption) I have watched it twice! What a movie. I want to suggest it to all who want to watch any awesome movie.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a cliché. It pales in comparison to much older (now often overlooked) movies of decades past. Do yourself a favour and do some digging - it won't take you long to find many, more thoughtful, more satisfying films of this type.",8
"One of the greatest movies of all time. The acting, the scenes , the music - everything combined makes it one of the greatest movies of al time.",9
"How many narrative monologues has he done since this ""epic"" film was made ?

50? 100?

I was thinking of setting up a data base to store them in.

How much storage space is there in The Cloud ?",10
"At the beginning, I have to say: I didn't think it would be the first rank in the IMDB list.

It had wonderful and memorable dialogues.

Maybe in the general view, the main story of the movie is simple, but the details were executed so well that it became a unique movie.

The events that happened to the prisoners after years of release were shown very professionally and were questionable to me.

Even though the end of the movie was not predictable and you didn't know what the purpose of the movie was, it was exciting to watch.

The name of the movie was chosen very interestingly and had a good connection with the script.",10
"I caught this movie close to the end just as Morgan Freeman was staring at the beam on the ceiling considering suicide. He plucks up the courage to go out look for a job and try to reintegrate himself into the system but he's been away for the better part of a century. Things have moved on and he's been pegged into that corner of existence known as Shawshank prison.

When it ended, I vowed to watch it again and I finally caught it again last year. The message is strong and vibrant, it resonates throughout the movie; HOPE NEVER DIES!! It is our steel, our spine, it's what separates men from beasts. The movie was a warming experience, I have learnt from it that friendship has ties that can survive anything, time, stress, human failings, ANYTHING!! I wanted to walk tall and shout Peace and Love to everyone.

The Shawshank Redemption liberated me from the fear of suffering.

Morgan Freeman (who is my icon any-day) blows the screen away just like he did in ""Lean On Me"". Unlike ""Lean On Me"" however, gentle persuasion and steady encouragement take the place of fiery enthusiasm. Red gives Andy the encouragement he needs to fight his way out of his situation but he teaches him to fight with his mind and heart.

Tim Robbins' emotionless Andy is eerie to watch as he drifts languidly with that glint in his eye that tells of wisdom born of suffering. I watched as the innocence faded from his face and he ""grew"" his plan. It is ironic that the person who was saved in jail for being spineless and weak, was the one who saved his friend from losing out to the world.

When the warden shoots his own brains out, I yelled ""Justice"" at the TV screen. The tag-line for me is ""Hope Is A Good Thing"" It really is...",5

"The Shawshank Redemption is perfect at conveying the brutality of such a prison and how it can change or destroy a human. It was very gripping and never felt boring even though largely there is no action throughout any of the film which just goes to show how good this movie was made. The music was nothing of disappointing however could have been better I think. Story was engaging with a good plot twist that I only saw coming about 10 seconds before the reveal. And it did a superb job of making me hate the villain of this story. Overall I would recommend this to anyone, not hard to follow and never boring.",9
"What is the only thing nobody can take from us? Faith can be taken, so as love, freedom definitely can be taken away; but there is one think that stays with us till the last breath we take and that is Hope. ""Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.""

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about hope, patience, friendship, and certainly freedom. It is a story of two men trying to survive while doing their time in Shawshank prison. The performance that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver individually and together is acting at its finest. Especially Freeman. His best performance ever. Actually I am not going to bother revealing the plot or the acting of this one for, I shouldfve started with that, it is a must see gem. It is a 2h 20 min movie but it doesn't stop for a minute to surprise and please.

I'll take the liberty to say that I've seen quite a lot of movies in my life so far and learned enough from them to be able to assure on the quality of this masterpiece. Take my word for it.",10
I finally watched this masterpiece and oh boy oh boy it has all the reasons to be the top spot. This is absolutely wonderful movie.,9
"What is salvation? Only by reigniting the hope in people's hearts can they be redeemed. Only hope is possible. Even if the environment is even worse, Andy has not given up. He continues to write letters in exchange for a better library for everyone, helping those in need to get a high school diploma so that they can be viable in society, even if they know it will anger The guards also want people to hear beautiful songs and ignite the light of hope. There is a bird that can never be closed.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film that tells the story of a man named Andy Dufresne who is wrongly convicted of murder and sent to the Shawshank prison. The film is a powerful portrayal of hope, friendship, and the human spirit, and features outstanding performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

The film is masterfully directed by Frank Darabont and features a hauntingly beautiful score that perfectly complements the story. The cinematography is also excellent, capturing the stark beauty of the Ohio countryside and the oppressive atmosphere of the prison.

It is a must-see for fans of drama and is a film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.",7
"Whenever you are feeling low, watch this movie and you will feel better.",8
"This is a love story, as old as the hills and yet with freshness that can only be given to us by great Celluloid actors such as Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. There are many examples of this throughout literature and the adaptation of this from word to film is breathtaking.

Andy and Red quite obviously have a deep and abiding love and respect for each other that transcends any feeling we might otherwise have about the nature of their love, which incidentally is not a homosexual love.

But let us not forget the other performances. How wonderful to see James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen and of course the brilliant William Saddler. It would have been too easy to slip into a prison melodrama but I think it was played perfectly by having Red narrate throughout, the two most wonderful pieces of narrative are where Andy plays Mozart over the prison loudspeakers and where Red sits in his cell, fearful and alone in the dark on the night of Andy's escape.

'Some things are just too beautiful.' 'Time draws out like a blade.'

I guess that encapsulates the whole thing for me, because it's how time draws out while watching this beautiful picture. The blade cuts you to the heart because you long for Red and Andy to fulfil their hope.

If I could, I would give this more than 10 out of 10 but I cannot. Instead I'll just say that this movie will give pleasure to people when played as an oldie in 50 years, because the story is timeless. No special effects, no fancy graphics, just a simple story, beautifully told and acted superbly.",10
"Few films have the power to touch the human spirit as profoundly as Frank Darabont's 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1994). Based on the novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' by Stephen King, this film stands as a testament to the enduring power of hope, friendship, and redemption.

Set in the 1940s, 'The Shawshank Redemption' follows the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he claims he didn't commit. Here, he meets Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a long-term inmate, and they form an unlikely friendship that grows over the decades.

Both Robbins and Freeman give powerful performances that form the heart and soul of the film. Robbins' portrayal of the quiet, intelligent, and resilient Dufresne is a masterclass in subtlety. Meanwhile, Freeman's Red serves as a wise and observant narrator whose voiceover adds depth and emotion to the narrative.

The screenplay, adapted by Darabont himself, shines in its simplicity and poignant dialogue. The characters are complex and their interactions genuine, contributing to the film's authentic portrayal of prison life. Yet, despite its bleak setting, the film maintains an undercurrent of hope that's powerfully uplifting.

Technically, the film is superb. The cinematography by Roger Deakins paints a grim yet oddly beautiful picture of prison life, while Thomas Newman's moving score complements the film's emotional narrative.

One of the film's most notable achievements is its pacing. At 142 minutes, it might seem lengthy, but the careful and patient storytelling ensures the audience is engaged throughout. The film's climax is a particularly satisfying pay-off to a narrative built on subtle hints and patient development.

Critically, the film was appreciated upon release, but it was slow to catch on with mainstream audiences. However, the years have only enhanced its stature. Today, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is not only regarded as a classic but has become an enduring symbol of the power of hope and friendship, with a coveted #1 spot on IMDb's Top 250 list.

In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a cinematic masterpiece, combining outstanding performances, a heart-rending narrative, and superior technical execution. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its universal themes and masterful storytelling. This is a film that truly stands the test of time.",10
"#TheShawshankRedemption One of the Best movie from 90's

What a movie a well written movie. This movie showcases the friendship b/w two prisoners hopes,dreams. Not for a sec it makes you bore. 1 of the best movie ever I watched of 90's.",10
"Morgan Freeman at his absolute best, Tim Robbins - better than ever - it must be a good film!!

The Shawshank Redemption grabs you tight and pulls you into its depth and drama. It is definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it.

This film shows the story of how hope can set you free. It is a beautiful film with excellent actors, an good story and shocking (but excellent) dialouge.

The Shawshank Redemption definitely deserves it's place as my no. 5 favourite film and IMDb's no. 3 user rated film.

My rating : Obviously 10/10.",4
This movie is the bomb!! Great Movie!! I don't have enough thumbs to recommend the Shawshank!! Great actors in a great story. This is a great movie to sit back with your girlfriend and just chill out. It's just superb. A must have in anyone's video collection!!,9
"amazing cast with characters acted and written in a way you deeply care for them
excellently paced
satisfying ending
just a solid feel good movie",10
"The story that emerges from from this unlikely source is hope and inspiration. I say unlikely source because the story comes from the pen of horror master Stephen King. This is not a story you can easily envision coming from his tortured soul. But perhaps King is in his element when words like prison, solitary confinement, torture and unrealistic all spring forth to describe the story of Andy Dufresne and his years at Shawshank prison.

Narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), Shawshank Prison has become his captive home of customers since he is able to procure certain items like cigarettes, candy and so on. For a self proclaimed innocent victim of the system, new comer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) ""Red"" is asked for a most unusual item - a rock pick. Andy is an amateur geologist. Andy and ""Red"" gradually become friends as people come and go, one way or another, from Shawshank as time passes them by.

What on the surface might seem like a depressing story and situation is filled with personal challenges and one's will to overcome impossible odds. The prison is speckled with interesting characters such as the oldest convict Brooks the librarian (James Whitmore) or the bible thumping man at the top of Shawshank, Warden Norton (Bob Gunton). Whether doing time like Andy or finally being release like Brooks or being torn between beliefs like Warden Norton, each man faces their own challenges while all of them endure the ravages of time.

Everything about this movie is done with the backdrop of the prison even though it is nothing like any typical prison film. The movie is based on Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. There is no horror that is normally found in King's work. Instead this is more of an inner character struggle like is found in another of King's work, Stand By Me. Like that story the two main character are linked in partnership with Tim Robbins giving a moving and powerful performance next to a solid character study by Morgan Freeman.

Director Frank Darabont delivers a solid film adding lots of life to what could have been a dreary background. The story flows evenly with a genuine care given to each character and each actor's performance. Shawshank is an instant classic and puts Robbins in the lead to play any every-man role aside the likes of Jimmy Stewart.",10
"This is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen. The acting of the main protagonists - Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman - are brilliant. The movie is about hope and redemption. It is also about how uncertain life is - how circumstances can lead a person to disastrous consequences through no fault of his own.

Tim Robbin's portrayal of Andy Dufresne - a banker who is sent to jail for murdering his wife - was as natural as ever. Morgan Freeman as a seasoned convict Red who goes through a transformation during his time with Andy makes you feel for the man. Bob Gunton will make you hate the evil hypocritical warden with all your heart. Overall, everyone has done a beautiful job with their roles.

This film touched a special chord in my heart. I never tire of watching it. If you love the drama genre, this movie is for you.",9
"Fantastic film that dramatically and powerfully displays the strength of the human will. With unforgettable performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. Subtle use of color (moreso lack thereof) helps to generate moods and feelings that resonate with the gripping plot and near-perfect dialog. A must see.",10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman headline this movie based on a story by Stephen King. Robbins is Andy, a banker falsely accused and convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. When he arrives at the prison he is expected to crack under the pressure of prison life, but he surprises Freeman's character by surely moving through as time passes no matter what the prison throws at him. He begins making inroads with both the prisoners and the guards and warden.

He sets up a tax service that all the guards from the prison and surrounding prisons use. When a lead surfaces on the possibility of Andy being innocent the warden who has used Andy to set up illegal accounts to hide money, has it snuffed out so he can keep Andy inside. This set Andy on the final course of action in the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic movie with great performances from all of its actors. A definite movie to add to any collection. See it as soon as you can.",10
"This movie will make you think in so many ways. It's so good! Such a great story, great acting, great directing, the list goes on.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of my favorite films. It was filmed in and around where I live (in Ohio), and I have actually visited the old prison where they shot much of the movie. I would love to know where they filmed the scene where Andy buried the letter and money in that countryside. It looks very familiar. Anyway, I thought Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were at their best, and had great chemistry together. The casting, so important to making a film work, was well done. Bob Gunton ,as the warden, does a great job. There is something intriging about escaping from a hopeless situation and changing your destiny. This is the first Steven King work I have actually enjoyed. Also, the background music really adds to the overall enjoyment and quality of the film. I am glad to see it is also considered one of the greatest films of all times by others.",10
"When I first watched ""The Shawshank Redeption"", I thought it was a O-K movie. Something in the characters and the motion picture score would draw me back to see the movie again. Now, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a classic. The story, adapted from a Steven King novel, stays true to the book. To me, there is something intriguing about a person changing his destiny, especially against all hope. The casting of the key players in the movie are right on target, and Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins work very well together. So, when you get a great script, talented actors cast properly, and a movie score that captures the mood and drama of the scene, it makes for a memorable movie.",10
"This film to this date - 26 years after having been released - still is such a classic. I am a sucker for prison films to begin with, so I could not let this piece go by so easily.

This film knows how to grip you intensely. Throughout the whole film I sat there in awe of how great the film was. The phenomenal acting, combined with the amazing writing, story and music makes up for an amazing film that everyone should see. While I was watching the film, I felt a range of emotions; and that's to me what makes a good film. It made me feel emotional, which is a really tough thing to do; few films have done this to me. Besides feeling emotional at times, I also felt happy and excited. It is safe to say that I haven't felt bored, unentertained or feeling regret for sitting through this film a single moment of the film. Morgan Freeman truly has been a gift to the world, because I really love his narration during this film; it just completes an already amazing film. I honestly can't imagine this film without his narration, but I can definitely say that it still would be amazing nonetheless.

It can be said with certainty that this film will stay a timeless classic, for generations to follow and love. Thank you Stephen King for the original book, and thank you Frank Darabont for making this story come to life so well because of your amazing directing.",10
"I consider this movie as one of the most fantastic and joyful movie to watch. It touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing. All of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character, every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions. This movie contains good drama, a different comedy insight. I think I have seen this movie at least 6 times and I just don't get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new things.I highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad.",9
IIve loved his movie from the time i was young. it teaxches you a lot about life.,9
"One of the most scenarios to be teach to the next generation of film makers ,as a script writer already learned much from that scenario monster.

I don't know when we can get another artifact such like this, from the director Frank Darabont or the legend Stephen King, from selection of the actors to the soundtrack screens stills everything was perfect to me I hope someday i can be able to produce something like that with one location and tight conversations to convince the audience before the filmmakers , as the audience review are giving you the trust and the encourage to continue and get another great job like that.",9
"I HAVE NOT SEEN MANY FILMS ABOUT PRISON LIFE. I KNOW WHAT I HAVE SEEN FROM TELEVISION (REMEMBER THOSE TV SPECIALS ""SCARED STRAIGHT""?), MAGAZINES, ETC. THEY ALL HAVE ONE SIMPLE THEME: PRISON IS ""HELL"" - AND THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME, FOR WHATEVER REASON, DESERVE THEIR STAY IN ""HELL"".

"Fear can hold you prisoner,Hope can set you free .",10
"One of the greatest movies of all time. The movie encapsulates all the values that give hope, patience and motivates us all to never give up. The characters, their performances is so unique. The musical score is by one of my all time favourite composer Thomas Newman. Timeless Masterpiece! Must have... Must Watch. . Must Share!",10
"Not long ago, maybe a year or two I was sitting watching the tube when I heard that that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was on that evening. The first thing that comes to mind is, (and which I regret very much) ""It's the other prison movie Stephen King wrote"". I had never seen The Green Mile, but here in Canada it got loads of publicity, I had mildly heard of The Shawshank Redemption, but I didn't know it's story, so I tuned in...I was blown away! Alot of people on imbd are saying every minute is worth watching you will love every second and want more and more-that's not true, sometimes you see so much that you just can't handle another person dying, or being raped, we're only human. If you think the whole movie is amazing, you are very patient. Sure, the first time you see it you get that impression but the second time you long to see the ending. If you only had time to watch a half an hour or so, the beginning or the ending is the part to tune into. The beginning (the first night in jail) is outstanding! When the man nobody knows wails the first night he's in the slammer and dies the next day you are blown away with impressions of the guards and prisoners.

And the ending, (when Red is explaining Andy's escape) is outstanding how smart Andy truely is! I won't spoil the ending for you if you've seen it you can assume and recall how amazing and thought provoking it is, and if you haven't seen it, this leaves an element of surprise. If The Green Mile was this good it maybe about time I look in to it.",10
"I watched this movie today, and while it was good it certainly IS NOT the #2 best Drama of all time. I hope that more people will sign up for IMDB after seeing this and start to post your user ratings as I would give it a good rating, but certianly not a 9.",5
"First off, films REALLY DO have the tendency to be overrated or underrated these days. And this film is no exception. Simple fact, I'm not a fan at all of Stephen King or his work, or the films that are BASED off his work. Just too dark, too controversial, too creepy, too horrendous, too controversial, and too uncomfortable to sit through.

Is this really one of the 10 best films of all time? Shawshank is not a downright bad movie but it has some severe flaws and I have no clue how everyone chooses to overlook them. The problem I have with it is how it absolutely oversimplifies everything. Shawshank for the most part focuses on exploring the idea of ""Hope"" (one of the most overused ideas in any prison movie), but in order to do so, it treats everything as black or white with no middle ground. I will say that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not an ""awful"" film. This isn't a poorly made film with more crude humor than storyline. One of the positives of the film lies in the IMAGERY. The shot of all the prisoners in the prison yard looking up to the heavens as music plays is an amazing shot, one of the most memorable shots I've ever seen.

Shawshank was really hard to watch; with all the violence and swearing, I don't think it does the story justice. I understand this film was nominated for Best Picture, and I've heard people whine, left and right, that Forrest Gump did, and Shawshank didn't. Well, the way I see it, I really don't mind. I don't like how this film seems to use the name of God, or Jesus, as a bad thing, used by the world's biggest hypocrites in Shawshank (ie. the Warden); it's one of the reasons why I like Forrest Gump better so much; there isn't much violence, hardly any swearing, and even treats & talks the name of the Lord in a good way.

The villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a ""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was.

I see that actors William Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn are well known for being in this flick, though a much better film that they both star in is ""Rocketman"" (1997), a wild, slap-happy family-friendly comedy. Please do check it out sometime!! And I don't even like hearing Morgan Freeman curse at all. ""Driving Miss Daisy"" is a much better performance of his, and is a great way for people to be introduced to him, growing up (or maybe even ""Evan Almighty"" is a good one, too). Tim Robbins, I guess was okay. Though he was also bizarrely in ""Howard the Duck""; it doesn't have anything to do with it, I know - it's queer to see how far he's come. And it sure is strange the head guard, who is often so prone to violence & swearing is the one who voiced Mr. Krabs in Spongebob Squarepants. Ar-Ar-Ar-Ar! Though to be fair, the escape scene is really where things get interesting, how everything comes together, and the ending definitely is pretty sweet - kinda makes you wish you could see the ending go on from there.

But in the end, I'm quite glad I didn't grow up with this film - because, sadly like many others, it might have brainwashed, badly-influenced, or manipulated me to what ""reality is supposed to be like"" in such a subversive & biased way.

I never had any friends that ever ""owned"" or ever ""recommended"" this film, because likely they feel the same way.

One other thing that subtly bothered me was, if this story takes place over 20 years in prison... why doesn't anybody seem to AGE??? What happened to the Makeup Department??

Though I don't entirely hate this film - it's got likable actors, good acting, cool character development (i guess), great camera work, decent music, some good effort, and a feel-good ended scene - but it's really overwhelmed by so much bad, it almost makes the good stuff non-existent or even seem ""sugar-coated"".

IMO, Groundhog Day is a much better film worth to be nominated for Oscar and even considered one of the ""greatest films ever"", not this nor ""the Godfather"".

5/10

PS: Want a better film from 1994??? Go watch either ""Iron Will"", ""Angels In The Outfield,"" ""The Jungle Book,"" ""The Swan Princess"", ""A Troll In Central Park"", ""Speed"", ""The Little Rascals"", ""True Lies"", ""The Santa Clause"", or even ""Forrest Gump.""

PS 2: ""Pulp Fiction"" should not even have been NOMINATED that same year for a ""Best Picture"" Oscar, being an overrated worthless pile of nothing - it should've been the Lion King nominated! Pulp Fiction can go off and die.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax. One of the best dramas of all time.

Mitchell Bulfin",10
"Freedom is a wonderful thing, and I cannot find an adverb that can be used to deepen its beauty. Although we have lost freedom to a certain extent, we still yearn for freedom.Freedom requires ability. Yes, we need the ability to resist discipline and the system. A strong-willpower person like Andy can give freedom not only to himself but also to others...",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. Yet as with any classic, we must not be blinded by its popularity, lest we overlook its flaws. And The Shawshank Redemption is not without its difficulties, but beyond those difficulties lies a heartfelt film, a film resilient in its hopefulness.

The Shawshank Redemption, for the most part, is seen through the eyes of Red, a prisoner in a high-security Maine prison who has been convicted on a charge of murder. Yet Red is not the true focus of the film, as Andy Dufresne steps onto the scene, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Red soon develops a friendship with Dufresne, and Red observes Dufresne like a curious onlooker, awed by his courage and knowledge.

These characters, the compelling story, and the direction are the three strongest points of the film. Each character is filled with life and plays an important role in both the film as a whole and in Dufresne's life. Never for a moment does the viewer question the plausibility of the characters and the circumstances in which they find themselves. This is where the story comes in, as the film contrasts dark reality with brilliance of hope. The story sucks the viewer into the film from the beginning, until it is so captivating, that the viewer could not escape if he tried. Furthermore, I was pleasantly amazed by Durabont's direction, as he creatively used the camera to capture even more wonderfully the hopefulness of the film.

However, Durabont has other difficulties, amongst which is the screenplay that he himself authored. Yes, there are times when the screenplay is emotional and heart-breaking, but there are also some foolish, implausible lines that detract from the movie's effect. Words were sometimes spoken when there should have been silence, leaving less interpretation up to the viewer while spitting clichés out from the characters' mouth. I felt that the acting was lacking a bit as well, even though as the viewer gets more used to the characters, their acting seems to fit, albeit imperfectly.

In conclusion, the high points of this film are higher than the low points are low. People generally like this film, and it's easy to see why, as it examines human existence in its own distinctive way. This examination has led it be considered one of the best films of the 1990s.

Final Grade: A-.",10
"In this Oscar-nominated, 1994 classic, two sagacious men with differing viewpoints regarding hope form a friendship over decades of imprisonment, finding consolation and subsequent redemption through acts of common decency.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece BEYOND dispute! It's first-rate cast enlivens Darabont's tremendously well-written script based upon the acclaimed novel by eminent novelist, Stephen King. I was amazed at how easy it was to sympathize with some of the film's convicts. The characters served as true to life exemplars of the effects of the cruelty of institutionalism. The theme of one's mindset and ability to hope determining their freedom gives the story THAT much more significance and merit. To have any kind of hope in a predicament as hopeless as serving a back-to-back life sentence is exceptional and well worth figuring out what the hell the two hours and twenty-two minute runtime is all about.

Oddly enough, the film does not display itself as bulky as it's runtime suggests. The film takes place over the course of several decades, only focusing BRIEFLY on any period of time. The clever editing and marvelous directing maintained the picture's steady pace. We're able to focus on and be more intrigued with the development of the two leads rather than how long they've been imprisoned. I was interested with how some characters were able to change their actions, while still transitioning between a mindset that is not so healthy to a mindset that would lead them to a better, freer life. It's immensely realistic and I'm certain that other viewers could see some of their selves in the characters made infamous by the phenomenal actors involved.

I'm glad I gave this film a chance. 94%!",10
"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has recently been one of the many movies to be overplayed on a network owned by Ted Turner. This is ironic because this was a box office disappointment. How come no one saw this in theaters? Probably because there's virtually no women. And an R-rated movie with no women means no naked breasts to the guys in America.

But after useless Oscar nominations and a strong audience on video, SHAWSHANK is now considered an agreeably entertaining and moving prison classic.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are perfectly cast together, probably because they are similar kinds of actors. They shine very well when the are side-by-side with another respectable actor. Look at Freeman co-star with Jessica Tandy, Brad Pitt, Denzel Washington, or Kevin Costner. Seem him hold his own in LEAN ON ME or DEEP IMPACT. Look at Robbins co-star with Susan Sarandon, Jeff Bridges, Robin Williams, or Martin Lawerence. See him hold his own in JACOB'S LADDER or THE PLAYER (among other great Altman movies). But what really makes the two relate is the fact that they are fine actors that have proved themselves in fine movies, yet we overlook them when we name living actors who we admire.

If you haven't seen this film yet, you will admire the crafty ending as well as the story or ultimately, the whole movie.

The characters are strongly structured and are never overshadowed by Robbins or Freeman, though those are the two to look at.

The only flaw that I find irritating in this film is the mysterious disappearance of William Sadler's stutter. Did it escape prison?

I have yet to see if THE GREEN MILE surpasses this beaut of cinematic storytelling, but even if it does, this is a movie to be remembered.",10
"This is a great movie, the acting is spot on, the characters are well potrayed and the overall story is very entertaining from beginning to end. This is deffinantly a top movie of the decade.",8
"This is one of the best movies I have come across. The acting of Tim Robbins is excellent but it is Morgan Freeman as Red who steals the show with a breathtaking performance. The story continually kept me interested and Tim Robbins' struggle against nearly every inmate in shawshank. Its possibly only his great friendship with Red that keeps him sane.

It was also strange to see one of the sisters in the movie who continually try to rape Tim Robbins, played marine hard man Drake in ""Aliens"", which is also one of my all time favourites.

Great movie. Rating 9/10.",9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) is both an excellent drama and the highest rated movie on IMDb, and for a good reason. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:

This movie is a prison movie. There are harsh language, a lot of profanity, violence (although not too graphic), and some psychologically intense moments. The opening scene features some very sensual elements, and the subject of rape is heavily present in the first half of the movie as well. Overall, it is easy to see why this is a R-rated movie.

Nevertheless, all of that can be derived from the Parents Guide. What the Parents Guide doesn't necessarily tell you is how impactful this movie is. It requires an additional half an hour after the credits have rolled to really be appreciated and soaked in, and make sure to take that into consideration. One should never put him- or herself in a stressful situation before, during or after watching this.

The Shawshank Redemption is brilliant, and treat it as such. Respect its voice over, its mood and atmosphere, and its music! Let it resonate. Enjoy it.

My personal grade: a powerful 9/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",10
"Before I saw this movie, it was hard for me to imagine why so many people liked it. I figured it must be one of those gritty movies that people like because of its harsh realism, but in truth it is so much more than that. In fact, I don't find it very gritty at all. I can now understand why it is the second highest movie on IMDb's Top 250 and why so many of my friends list it as their favorite movie. It is the most emotionally powerful movie I've ever seen and I doubt anything I see will top it.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman plays the convicted killer Ellis Redding that befriends Andy in prison. These are two very touching and true performances. Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for the quiet intensity he brought to his role. He takes on the right sense of mystery required for the role and he gives the movie the conviction it needs to reach its emotional heights. Marlon Brando claimed that some roles are actor-proof- the story is so good that no actor can mess it up. This could possibly be one of those roles, but I can't help feeling that a lesser actor would have overacted and destroyed Robbins's character. Morgan Freeman was nominated, and justly so (though it is an injustice that he was chosen above Robbins; they both are equals in this movie). He complements Robbins beautifully as a stoic man that understands prison life better than anyone else. He also narrates the movie; we see things through his eyes and experience things through his words. As in Million Dollar Baby, his voice provides the movie with its thematic focus. The supporting cast is fine, but James Whitmore stands out as the prison librarian.

The actors do not make this a great movie though. They were given a great story and they lived it for us perfectly, but it is the story that lives on after the movie is over. Stephen King may be a pop fiction author, but he has an extraordinary grasp on human nature which is brought to light in Shawshank.

Marlon Brando also said that movies are good because of what we bring to them, and I suppose there's some truth in that, though there are some movies that are good no matter what- Casablanca and Citizen Kane, for example. I don't know which category this movie belongs to and I'm afraid that because I love it so much I don't trust myself to say. I can say, however, that everyone can identify with the triumph of the human spirit, and maybe that explains why it is such a beloved movie.

It really is a shame that The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994, the same year as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. All three are great movies, and all three deserved Best Picture. But to me, Shawshank is the best of them all and will continue to resonate with me for a long time to come.",10
I guess the title of the review speaks for itself so just watch it you'll enjoy it.,8
"The Shawshank Redemption was one of the deepest movies I've ever seen. There were no fight scenes, car chases, anything like that, but my attention was there. I don't know too many movies that can do that.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were awesome in this movie. Tim Robbins' character evolves in this movie. He begins as this innocent (literally) guy who kept to himself, and then he became more sociable and demanding. As for Freeman, the movie would not be the same without him.

The warden. I really hated that guy. The only antagonist I hated more than this warden was the bad guy from the Patriot.

What I liked most about this movie is that they portray life within a jail cell. They show that the people who are imprisoned are not all bad, and some shouldn't even be there. We all forget that some of those people are in there for murder, and we even feel sympathy for them.

I would recommend this movie to people who liked the Green Mile. Not only is it another jail movie, it was written by the same author, and yes, I do believe Stephen King is the best modern writer of all. If you have not seen this movie, you are missing out on the movie that redeemed the film industry. Remember, salvation lies within.",10
"A hymn to the determination and belief of man, 'Shawshank Redemption' truly deserves its place as the second best film made in the IMDB poll.

How on Earth we all missed this one when it was at the cinema is truly baffling; but it has now gained the worldwide recognition it so richly deserves.

Robbins is absolutely superb as Andy Dufresne and actually surpasses Freeman's performance (about the only actor to do this) as 'Red'. It's pointless describing the story, suffice to say that it stands head and shoulders above all other movies as a testament to the endurance and power of the human spirit, that almost no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we can endure and prevail.

Incredible, thought-provoking and a cornerstone of modern day storytelling.",10
"This movie is simply outstanding and is one of the best if not the best I've ever seen. Its my joint 3rd favourite with Darabont's other great king adaptation The Green Mile and Seven. This movie is flawless on every level. The key to it though is possibly the greatest ever script ever written by Darabont, and truly outstanding acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. No need to go into the plot. This movie is all about hope and will inspire you to do anything. The brilliant ending is definitely the best i've ever seen and brought a tear to my eye. Watch this movie whenever your happy or sad. It doesn't matter. The film will give you so much hope and happiness. It really is that brilliant. In fact i'm watching it now.

WATCH IT NOW 10/10- Probably the greatest movie ever made",10
"Ya know, I never heard of the Shawshank Redemption before I came to the IMDB. I looked at the top 250 and saw it ahead of 1994's Forrest Gump and in the number 2 spot all time and thought, ""man, what is this?"" I found out a couple weekends ago and I'm not in the least bit disapointed. It was great, I loved it. I can say nothing that hasn't been said already. Great film, I wish I had seen it earlier. Awesome! Haven't seen it? SEE IT!",9
"but the #2 movie of all-time ??!!?

It's all opinion, of course. However, I doubt even Stephen King or Tim Robbins would vote for this enjoyable saga as the #2 all-time movie. It is a marvelous adaptation of King's short story. Robbins, Freedman, and Gunton are all terrific, as is James Whitmore in his short role.

My biggest criticism is the slow detailing of Red's every move after being released from prison, and before going after the fortune. That part was a bit labored and overlong. Nonetheless, the movie was witty, exciting, and well-acted, but was purposefully limited in scope. Very good, yes! Excellent? Perhaps. Great? I must demur on great.",10
"This film is based on Stephen King's story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It was part of a collection of four short novels, among them Apt Pupil (adapted by Bryan Singer) and The Body (made into Stand By Me by Rob Reiner). Shawshank was a great story and the film adaption by Frank Darabont is brilliant. The film is highlighted by the strong performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

This movie has everything you could want in a film: inspiring story of people persevering through bad times, strong directing and acting (two of the very best actors of today) and one of the classic endings I've seen in a movie.

Shawshank is well-made and inspiring. It has joined my personal movie hall-of-fame, which includes The Grapes of Wrath, High Noon, Goodfellas, L.A. Confidential and Bugsy. I also reccomend The Green Mile, Darabont's most recent King adaption.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is amazing, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.

If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my favorite of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10",10
"Great characters. Beautifully filmed. Moving...sad, yet beautiful and top shelf story telling. There has to be enough accolades to warrant viewing this here so I won't blather on about what a great flick this was except to say it was. Watch it and if you don't agree on it's placement...you must be...unbelievable.",10
"This was on sale for £5 so I had to buy it after all the rave reviews I'd heard from everybody. In hindsight, I only wish I had bought it sooner. This film is a fascinating tale of a mans journey through prison life, wonderfully illustrating his relationships with fellow inmates and staff. Stephen King had his freshest idea which knocks socks off all his other work including Stand By Me (adaptation from his novel The Body).

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give flawless performances in the lead roles and are supported superbly by the rest of the cast including Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows and Mark Rolston. Ironically for me, Mark Rolston plays one of the worst characters in history in my opinion (Drake from Aliens) so in his evil role, it had a great effect on me. The characters are key to this film as they narrate the story and move the film forward so credit must go to the casting directors for picking such an effective cast. It is understandable why Freeman was Oscar nominated for this role as he is near perfect. The smile he gives at the end if the film is more valuable than a thousand words.

The plot to this is superb; an innocent man seeking freedom, a redeemed man seeking peace and a hideously corrupt prison are all elements of a nicely complicated plot which, at the same time, is easy to follow. The events in the final quarter of the film are so intelligently conceived, well done and convincing, that the film just falls perfectly in to place. A masterpiece of a film.

Films like this are important because the film industry often ignores themes of hope in the wake of terror. Shawshank is an inspirational tale of a man's honesty and bravery against a hideously corrupt and brutal system. This is why Shawshank Redemption is still talked about and adored by all who have seen it and why it will always be talked about. Cool to see an IMDb segments in the DVD featurette!",9
"Year after another this movie has defended its place on IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time -list and it has done in at the second place. Is there anyone who finds it kinda odd that it's on the second place rather than the first one? I mean, at the Top 250 -list this and ""Godfather"" has the rating of 9.1, but when you click on ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it seems to have the rating of 9.2 and even more votes than ""Godfather"". Is it just that the staff at IMDb has just simply forgotten to update the list? Well anyways, to the review itself. I just watched this movie last night and I've seen it once before as well, as I am indeed the proud owner of the DVD. The movie is just pure excellence, or at least for me and it is no wonder it's ranked so high at IMDb. A perfect example of the fact that Stephen King is not just a writer of horror.

What probably amazes me the most in this movie is that it's just so very well written. I mean, I think that a screenplay couldn't be more perfect than it is in this movie. It's just so good that it makes you smile throughout the movie, it just flows through so smoothly that it makes you think ""How on earth can it be this good?"" Pieces of the puzzle connect together in a rhythmic way, which make your eyes freeze because of the harmonic perfection it provides, it makes you show your emotions: It makes you sad, it makes you angry and it makes you laugh. It's just so good you don't want it to end. Just pure completeness.

The cast is just superb, every right actor for the right role. I must admit that I've never liked Tim Robbins so much, but in this movie the role given to him is just perfect and the role performance he does is his best yet to date. No other person can make that cold glance he does with his eyes, the whole cold substance he has. There is just something so spooky in him. Even when Tim Robbins does a great job, even more greater job does the all mighty Morgan Freeman, who I think is one of the best actors in the history of the movies. The man just doesn't have a bad role performance, maybe even not an average one. His role performance as ""Red"", the provider of things at Shawshank prison, is for me just so ideal. I think that the choice of him being the narrator in the monologue is just brilliant. Morgan Freeman's voice is just so fitting to this movie that it almost makes your skin tremble. The monologue itself is also very well written and it progresses itself among the whole screenplay in a so magnificent way that.. Well, I already told you about the completeness.

The one who is in charge of the music is the composer Thomas Newman, who I think is the perfect choice for composing the music to a movie like this. If I had to choose someone else, I think the closest one would be Micheal Giacchino, but I can't even think about that so much as the music in this movie is just so amazing in the way it is. The main theme of the composition is just beautiful and the whole soundtrack just simple blows you away. The chords build up this entirety and changing variations throughout the movie which can only be envied because of the beauty of it. Just brilliant.

I can't praise this movie enough, I feel like I'm still not complimenting it enough, but in the matter of fact that's all I've done in this review. I have to mention the directing as well. It's just so smooth it collaborates with the screenplay so well, that it just is a real pleasure for the eyes. The director Frank Darabont really, quoting all the cliché's of complimenting, really captures the essence of this movie. It's just not the parts which make you the most amazed, it's honestly the whole movie. I can't say directing could be more perfect because it just is. In my opinion anyways.

If you haven't seen this movie, you've really missed a masterpiece in the history of movies. I tried to write this review without giving away any spoilers, as the plot has some twists and tweaks in it as well, so it's also very original. Just see this movie and you will finally understand how it is on the second place at IMDb.

The Shawshank Redemption shines even after 13 years.",10
Its my all time favorite movie. The twists and turns in the movie will amaze you to the core.,9
"The Shawshank Redemption is simply a fabulous piece of cinematic story telling. The casting is excellent, the characters are believable, the story is compelling, and the cinematography is spot on.

The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, and his battle to survive a wrongful conviction and life sentence in Shawshank Prison. He forms a close friendship with another lifer - Red - and an uneasy relationship with prison boss Warden Norton. His finds his own way to survive the physical and mental pressures imposed upon him.

It is not always the case with films that we root for 'the good guy', but in this case you surely will. The good and the bad is so skillfully delineated in this film, and the characters so deeply developed, that it simply draws you further and further in. A brilliant movie.",6
"Two words: Flawless masterpiece. While not the greatest movie ever made, it should certainly rank extremely high. Unless you're completely repulsed by the idea of a prison film, or if you're too immature to appreciate good drama, you're going to absolutely love, love, love this film. This film was largely overlooked at the time because of the mega-popular ""Forrest Gump"" (an extremely excellent film in its own right), but it holds up because of a timeless quality that very few films possess (I know the film's only 7 years old, but I think that's long enough). If you're uncomfortable with some of the more graphic themes of the movie, it's still worth a look (certain cable networks regularly show an edited for TV version of the movie). This is a must see for anyone who calls themselves a film-buff.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is a true Stephen King film. Darabont's effort in the screenplay was astonishing. I love this film. The whole story has twists and turns and surprises in every corner. The best prison movie, most definitely. Robbins delivered a powerful performance. He should have won an Oscar for this film. I loved it and I hoped, I'm sure, that everyone else loved it. I give this film a solid, gold TEN. Highly recommended for those who have taste in movies. If you have any comments for me, please e-mail me at tylerripen@yahoo.com.",10
"yes this movie is one of the greatest

This movie changed my thinking about people who go to prison. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance no matter what it is. They need to be given a chance to change themselves. Morgan Freeman did justice to his role i was really touched at the end part when he's there for the parole and the words that came out of his mouth. Tim Robbins was tremendous, its the first time i noticed him as an actor and he's one of the best.

prison is terrible place to be its like a whole new world and my perspective has changed about that. I rate this movie 10/10 its the best, the story is great and the director does a great job. well done",10
The actors were excellent. For the most part these actors stay out of politics. You have to feel sorry for the prisoners in the film. But remember they are criminals.,10
"Who knew that this would one day be the highest rated movie on IMDb, so famous and loved by so many people. I think this is a must watch for everyone since we all can relate to it at least once throughout.

This has the hidden meaning too, which I hope you find at the end of movie. It was lovely and I still re-watch it whenever I feel down, never got bored. It will always stay in my top 5 movies of all time. The way the characters develop over time, especially with Morgan Freeman's voice narrating it, movie gets immense depth ranging from the story to the characters.

Absolutely, these actors have us a fine masterpiece one that is worth the time.",10
"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a good movie. It has a solid cast, a solid script, and solid cinematography. The film is at times engaging, moving and thrilling. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything particularly wrong with it.

But that doesn't make it a great movie.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a very safe film. Not so much in terms of story, but in how it's executed. Frank Darabont directs the film competently, and seems content to stay at that level the whole time. Roger Deakins, possibly the best cinematographer working today, seems to be phoning it in, and the usually excellent Thomas Newman provides an unmemorable score. Everyone seems to be operating at three- quarters cylinder, enough to be good, but never enough to be amazing.

This extends to most of the performances. Tim Robbins as the wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne is not a particularly engaging lead. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are fun in antagonistic roles, but they've both given much better performances. The ensemble cast of prisoners is game, but very few of them are given much to do.

The standout performance is easily Morgan Freeman's Red, who helps Andy navigate life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, and that has more to do with Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman than it does anything to do with the role.

There is little wrong with ""The Shawshank Redemption"". But it takes more than having nothing wrong to make a great film. A great film requires risky decisions, new ideas or masters of their craft bringing their A-game. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has none of these, and that's not a bad thing. It's a decent film. Just not a masterpiece.",10
"Locked in the confines of prison, one expects the insanities to unfold, to break the human spirit and rape it of its essence, but one thing above all else allows survival for even the misjudged guilt of one man who must wake up to realize the awful truth. That thing is hope, and it breathes through every inch of this movie, as well as a sensational feeling of greatness.

Every moment and every bit of emotion is genuine, well spent. The whole feel and experience of it all will not only touch the little person inside us all, but will also give you a taste of a great story and masterful film making. I have always loved this movie, from the moment I first saw it in theaters, and every further time I see it when watching it from my video collection.

Films like this continue to inspire me in my own endeavours, to fully engross me within its stone walls, to make me realize every bit how precious freedom truly is. May this movie live on in the collections of everyone, and may no person have to experience even a fraction of the pain and suffering found in this great film...",10
This movie is a must watch.timeless. No regret. Best of the best.one of thoses movies taht you will remember forever,10
"I watched ShawRed as the first movie on my PC when i bought it. Some how the engineer who formatted my drive put this movie along with few other movies for me to see as he had limited collection of movies. I watched this movie and I simply loved it, especially the end. Along with time this movie has grown over me and the more i think about it, the more i like it. It truly deserves all the recognition it is getting, though i do not consider it better than Godfather but still i find it a masterpiece movie. Great acting by both leads, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. In fact, everyone acted well in this movie. The direction deserves standing ovation and Frank Darabont, the director also deserves hats off for his very gripping screenplay. It is very difficult to maintain much interest of audience in same interior scenes if they keep repeating themselves but DOP has done a fine job too. All n all a master movie and for new generation it is a must watch to know what movies were made just twenty years back.",10
"This film is a testament to human will where hope never dies. Andy Dufresne was falsely imprisoned and forced to live a life as a murder convict. Every day in the Shawshank Prison is another day that can break the will of his unyielding humanity that could never be caged.

Andy was someone who was self reliant. The taxes, library and the money scam all relied on one person, Andy. Even ""hope"" was something Andy brought to prison and it ultimately got Red out of parole as he finally understood ""freedom"" was not on the bargaining table at the parole board. That was something he has to find separately.

Red on the other hand relied on his environment. Outside of jail, he stole from others. In jail, he was the man who can get things, but without other inmates and the prison economy, he was a nobody.

In the book, Andy comes to Shawshank with money kiestered so everything about Andy says ""independent"" while the criminal justice system turned Red into someone who's very soul was in the hands of the Parole Board. But Andy's final revenge was aimed at the crooked system. The Warden was dependent on Andy, like how the prisoners were dependent on the system. And in the end, he took his life as Brooks had because the prison was all they knew.

I can go on and on.....This film is pure masterpiece.",10
"When I had finished watching the movie,I was excited and wanted to watch it again.Wheather the figures and details or the spirit that the music conveyed to.""Hope is dangerous"" Red had ever said,But Andy has always sticked to it.He didn't cry when he was thrown into prison though he was innocent.On contrary,he found ways to kill long time to escape.He helped the head of the prison do the illegal things in order to gain some freedom.He rebuilt a library and helped the other prisoners.All the prisoners liked him,for he helped them find hope again.Perhaps it was time to escape,in a lightening and thundering night,he escaped from the prison through the hole he had dug for twenty years .He was free eventually . I like Andy ,for his talent and his wisedom .And the most important thing that I like is his spirit-never giving up.",10
"God, what a beautiful film! The performances are very good both from the main characters and the supporting characters, the photography is very good but what caught me the most is the whole of it all and the story. A story that we will hardly forget and with good messages such as the conviction in what we believe and the great power of friendship.",7
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a successful banker who is innocently sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of murdering his wife and lover. Although the film refers to corruption in the system, it seeks to give meaning to life in its world of meaning. Andy Dufresne manages to escape from prison in the worst and most difficult conditions of prison with life imprisonment and reaches liberation and freedom. Unlike other prisoners, he can pass through the bars, barbed wire and walls and swim a long distance in the sewage and excrement to expose his naked body to the rain after his release and his gaze from the cold and gray space. Shawshank sewed the walls of the prison deep into the blue sky because he found the reason for life, and according to Nietzsche, whoever found the reason for life will build it anyway.",10
"Please, you have to watch it onetime in your life!",7
I don't like this movie erase it this sucks y does this exist ahhhhh,10
An absolute masterpiece from start to finish. A perfect ten.,10
"This is one of my fave movies because its so beautiful. The acting , the story and the filmmaking. This is how all movies should be made...with heart. The story is so simple but its shaped and made a master piece.

If you have not seen this movie, and you are 15 or 55 years old,I'm telling you that you are missing a lot.

I give it ********** out of ********** because it moved me so much, the way its showing the human nature, the good and the ugly side of it.",10
This movie might be the best movie I've ever seen.,10
"The plot, dialogs, acting, characters, flow,... everything is perfect and well balanced to create a unique movie. Already a classic.",9
"The movie actor Andy was thrown into the prison by no good reasons. During his stay in the prison he managed to improve the situation in that prison for the prisoners. Finally he escaped the restrictions of the hell-like prison through a tunnel he dug himself little by little, day by day.

There was something different on Andy. He seemed not one among the prisoners but the one in another world as Red narrated. He did not want to act in collusion with others; instead, he did everything in his own way. He never gave up hoping that one day miracle would occur. While doing the day-by-day work, he was occupied in digging a tunnel quietly, secretly and planningly so as to escape from the terrible life in the prison at the right moment. He did succeed.

In my eyes, Andy is really a big hero, a second Mounte Crisco. He deserved the life that he¡¯d been dreaming of . Even now I still remember the conversation made between Andy and his good friend, Red, a black person. They were talking about Hope. Red said ¡°Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place he better gets used to the idea.¡± But Andy did not agree with him. He considered that ¡°That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope.¡± At the moment, Andy¡¯s words were deeply imprinted on my mind and I was suddenly lost in deep meditation¡­

Hope? What is Hope? Hope is as Andy said. Hope is something that holds you stand and push towards. Hope is slight light in the darkness. Even though it is meager, it can lead you to brightness and to a colorful world that you dream of. Hope is in your heart .Only if you keep a new morrow¡¯s sun, black clouds can not confine its glory into their own world. Where there is hope, there is sunshine .Where is sunshine, there is life. Hold your hope tight and hold your life.",9
"Well it was not until recently I saw this one....a few of my friends had seen it and were completely raving about it....finally saw it a few days back...it takes some time to fully absorb it....what an outstanding cinematic achievement....!!! It is a complete pity that the movie released in the year of 1994, because it was robbed of a well deserved Oscar, given pulp fiction and and Forrest gump also released the same year.....this movie has everything. ...memorable performances, characters, a good story....it also has a lot of repeat value...this is a kind of movie which you can go back to whenever you are down in life...there are a few cinematic liberties taken....but thats pardonable.",10
"I have watched thousands of movies till date but this movie is beyond everything. I just love the way presented the story and every second of this movie was very fascinating and kept me hooked for an entire part.

I have watched this movie five years ago and still never found better alternative for good entertainment. I think the movies like this should be made in a form of web series because the content is much more and the characters should be more elaborated in a series.

I think someone should try to make a web series on a story of Shawshank Redemption and I think it will be loved by everyone.",10
This film is a rough griddy prison film and it was designed to feel so. A powerful message and honorable effort with acting and set design deserve to be recognized but I cant help but wonder how this film got to this spot. From my view of movies the true putstanding masterpieces are like the Mona Lisa or Starry Night. Pieces that you can identify in every instance or location. Shawshank was very much a blur for me. Although the film indvidually was by no means a low quality film. I find it falls short of other films on the top 250. I wouldnt even put it in the top 5 of its genre nore the top 5 of its decade. This film still has value but Im wondering if it suffers from mass overating or bandwagoning.,9
"This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first 10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made. A must watch film!!! 10/10",10
"Well, what can one say, seen it now umpty times over the years and it remains one of the best m9vies ever. Not only is the story gripping but the acting, out of this world mostly. Not only gripping, drama, humour, it has it all. It is so well played you feel like that you are locked up with them. Get the popcorn out, have a nice cold beer ready, you are going to love this and sit through it in one session!",10
"I saw it again to try to remember if it is such a great movie. Well... it is a great movie. Stories, acting, directing. But... definitely not thet movie ever.",10
"When I look at the IMDB Top 250 list, I am generally dismayed by both the films that are missing and those that should not be there. However, I am delighted to see The Shawshank Redemption right up at number 2. This movie is absolutely superb, far surpassing the story on which it was based. The plot is brilliant, and once again it shows Morgan Freeman to be one of the greatest actors of all time; it amazes me that he has been given so few awards.

When Tim Robbins was interviewed, he called this a ""love story"", and that is exactly what it is - a story of a wonderful (and completely non-sexual) love between two men, a love that is born in an incredible hell-hole and helps to raise them out of it. It's the sort of movie you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.",10
"I just wonder now, why I still didnt try to watch it, considering I was in love with Stephen's stories in my childhood. The episode looks really realistic and profound, like I love. The characters are deep, not two-dimensioned, like it is always now. In one moment of the movie(Andy led some talks about setting free from the prison with Morgan) I was wondering If Freeman was expressing his real emotions, because it really looked like that. So. I recommend it to everyone without any doubt! enjoy the watching and amazing play!",9
"A long road to freedom, a deep washing of the soul.This is an immortal inspirational classic",10
"One of the so-called greatest films of all time - at last one I can agree with.

The movie is a classic blockbuster: great acting, great plot, great dialogue and great directing.

The writing is fantastic, the screenplay translates so well from the original text without losing much.

One for the history books and for your permanent collection.",9
One of the most compelling watches ever. Such a wonderful perspective on the human condition. Morgan Freeman's narration is stunning. Tim Robbins is brilliant. This film is somehow restorative to the spirit.,10
"Damn son, why is this movie so high in the charts? Isn't it another prison movie?  Oh it is more? The convicts are the good guys and the wardens are the bad guys? Wait a second there champ; isn't that the case for every prison movie there is? What is that? It has Morgan Freeman having lots of cool internal monologues that border the poetic? And speaking of poetic, isn't there a lot of poetic justice in this movie? There is? I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE!

OK folks, let's be straight about it. This movie is a teen adventure masked as a gritty drama. The setting is pessimistic as heck and the characters act like they are all boy scouts. If you see the whole thing from a realistic point of view, it is basically making heroes out of criminals and villains out of the system of justice. And it is also about rewarding the heroes and punishing the villains with a cop-out way and heading for poetic justice.

Of course the movie was never supposed to be realistic and it is a mistake to go in with a critical mind. It is about a feel-good mentality, to never give up no matter what problems life throws at you. So seriously, don't try to reason that sweet old guy who didn't want to leave prison but the evil warden gave him his freedom and thus ruined his happiness. Neither try to make sense of why the system refuses you parole while you want to and agrees when you give up. Or how someone digs a tunnel for 20 years and an inspection never finds the hole or the soil he was removing. That is not the point anyway. It is about making the best of what you have and defending your ideals with your life.

A thing which definitely stands out is that the objective of the film is not for the protagonists to escape. Freedom is not found outside the walls of the prison yard but in the state of your mind. This is what Andy manages to offer to everyone by gradually transforming the gray cells into a place where the inmates can find recreation, hobbies, and even wisdom through a library. They find happiness even when confined.

Of course I am too much of a cynical bastard and I couldn't get into the above mood so well. Call it unwillingness to suspend disbelief but when I saw all the things Andy offered to the inmates I was only thinking of how more dangerous they will be if they ever get out, with added wisdom and crafts in their disposal. Because most criminals don't reform in prison as you probably know; they learn new tricks and come out more dangerous than before. Of course the movie was heading for the fluffy feeling of thinking ""Hey, if you give criminals enough hobbies and recreation in prison, and treat them like human being, they will be law- abiding citizens when they return to society"". Sweet thought, but still unrealistic since it mostly takes for them to get a proper job to support a family and stay away from their criminal connections. And yes, I am missing the point but that is how I felt while watching it.

Would any of the magic in this film work if we were told that every major convict had killed a dozen people, raped several women, and molested his own kids? Nope, but the past is not the point. It is abut offering redemption to them regardless of what they had done. Giving them a second chance if they deserve it and helping them to get back on their feet after all the beating life gave them. Sweet concept, very nicely presented, but I am still a cynical bastard, so I give it no more than a 7/10.",7
"Somehow, I missed this film the first go around. Very impressed.....I only hope that prisons have improved in the last 70 years....but I fear they have not. This is a cautionary tale for any person hell bent on going to prison. Rise up and do some good where you are standing. It is a long, bleak, lonely time in prison.",10
"Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman There are some movies that when you watch them you can't help but feel you've done more than watch a movie. Sometimes it feels like you've been part of something bigger, like you witnessed a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is like watching poetry. It is one of the most tragic, heartfelt, and deeply satisfying stories to have ever been put onto the big screen. There really is a reason that this movie is number two on the internet movie database's top movies of all time.

The premise of the movie is fairly simple. Andy Dufraine (Robbins) is wrongfully accused with the murder of his wife and her lover, and he is sentenced to two life sentences to be served back to back at Shawshank prison. The plot is simple, and yet at the same time deeply complex. This movie is a celebration of the human spirit, a celebration of hope and of freedom.

Life is difficult for Andy right from the beginning of his life sentence. It takes him at least a month before he goes and talks to anyone. The first person he does talk to is Red (Freeman), a man in the prison who is able to get things. Need to get a pack of cigarettes, a toothbrush, maybe some playing cards, then Red is your man on the inside. Andy asks Red to pick up a rock hammer so that he can carve stones.

This movie is anything but a fairy tale. It depicts prison life as being cruel, unfair, bitter, and downright horrible. Decent people die, people get gang raped, the guards beat the ever-loving daylights out of anyone who steps out of line. Shawshank prison is one hard place to serve your time.

After being in prison for a couple years, Andy gets transferred from laundry duty to library, mainly so the warden can send his men over to get financial advice from Andy. Andy starts doing income tax for the guards and the warden, setting up trust funds, and various other financial services, and after a few years, he becomes the man who launders the warden's dirty money. Sure, he got transferred to the library, but the only difference is he's washing money and not sheets and clothes.

Andy takes up all sorts of projects while he's in Shawshank. He makes chess pieces for a chess board, he makes it his personal task to obtain funds for and build a new prison library. He helps several of the inmates get their high school equivalence. He does whatever he can to pass the time and keep himself a little bit sane.

I'd hate to spoil the ending for anybody who hasn't seen this movie, so I will be very vague. All I will say is that it is one of the most satisfying and beautiful endings to any movie or story that has ever been captured. This movie is a masterpiece, and you would do yourself a favour to make sure you watch it. And if you've already seen it, watch it again, and introduce somebody else to the world of Shawshank prison.

Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",9
"Shawshank is among the very finest of movies I've ever seen, because it touches me personally as no other film has ever done. Andy Dufresne's anguish over his circumstance is so close to my own, it's as though he were telling MY story, not reading from a fictitious script. Especially moving is the scene, sitting with Red, he tells how, no, he didn't kill his wife, etc., etc., and the remainder of the ensuing conversation, and his decision to ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" is as close to my heart and soul as any screen dialog I've ever heard. No, I didn't kill my ex-wife,(she's still alive and well), but my personal anguish over the circumstances and travails I've endured through the years, are truly mine, to the nth degree. If I were to write a script of my own life, the script of Shawshank would be mine! As for inconsistencies in the story, however, the one glaring defect so obvious is that no facility in the world keeps the same man in the same cell for 20+ years without change, or even the normal shakedown inspections. How Andy managed to cut a hole through the wall behind the poster without being discovered is absolutely ridiculous, it just doesn't happen! Morgan Freeman's sonorous voice narration simply adds to the warmth and beauty of the storyline, so heartfelt and true-to-character, it brings tears to the eyes. Yes, Shawshank is among the best ever, Thank You, one and all!",8
10/10 - Must Watch. The performances in this film are simply amazing. The story is tragic and memorable. The directing is one of the best I've ever seen. It's perfect.,10
"I loved the movie and it's concept. The storyline was outstanding.

Morgan Freedman did an outstanding job as best supporting actor. And Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, did a remarkable job.

And the rest of the cast did great also. The movie was just awesome.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time! Overall, The Shawshank Redemption not a movie, it's a emotion.",10
Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen. Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.,10
"This movie (The Shawshank Redemption) is not the best ever. What are people thinking about? Of course it is better than 1 star - but 10???? It is a nice movie, with a fine happy ending. But to make it number one in the world, is a bit too much. There can be only one number one - and that is without a doubt The Godfather.

Please everyone, try to consider your votes again - I hate to see that things are not in the right perspective. If IMDb should be accepted as the world real Bibel for film lovers, The Shawshank Redemption can't be our top movie. A lot of other movies are far better. Among them; The Godfather part 2, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Fight Club, The Prestige, Once Upon a Time in The West - and many more. Please change your votes........",6
"It feels like I am watching a real thing happening in front of you. It doesn't seem to be acting at all. It is not surprising that this is a movie until the list of crew members at the end of the film comes out. The genius of the mind, the familiar business ability, the perseverance of perseverance, and the determination to bear the burden of humiliation eventually led to a perfect escape that lasted for 20 years. The hero finally regained his freedom, and the bad guys also suffered from their own consequences. It is better to say that the protagonist thought of the final ending from the beginning.",10
Even I thought Albert Einstein's IQ is a child infront of Andy's IQ...,10
Good movie but grade doesn't fit the reality that this movie is not the best of all time. It deserves 7 Top but I will give lower grade just to put it where it belongs hopefully.,10
The cast as this movie is legendary if they had picked anyone else for any of the parks it would not be one of the best movies made🖤🎟🎬🎥🌟🌟🌟🌟💜💜💜💜💜💜,10
"This is one of the best movie ever made, it's a story about hope.

I procrastinated for a few years thinking that this movie might just be a overrated one but boy was I wrong. This is an engaging good hearted film based on a novel by Stephen King.

The story commences with a theme of murder mystery but slowly unfolds into a picture of friendship, faith & hope. We see a plethora of characters that gives /us different life of prisoners, officers their emotions & journey within journey. The climax is one of the best I've ever seen it's an eye opener and we'll surely think of that for a very long time.

Highly recommend it, maybe the best movie I've ever seen. 10/10",8
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are in a dynamic role in this film. I could not imagine a lot of innocent people inside a gigantic prison of history. When I saw Clancy Brown first time, looked so tough, he's big too. I also like Clancy's role, too. He should be a great fighter. What is good for Andy Dufrense (Robbins) is that he makes an unbelievable escape route to run away from prison, finally.",10
"...followed,very closely,behind by Stand By Me.

The novella Rita Hayworth... is one of his best as well,so when I heard that it was being made into a film,i was worried at how it came out.

All that worrying was for nothing.

Superb performances(Sorry, but where was the Oscars for Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Frank Darabont etc),a script that sticks to the novella but doesn't get bogged down in over plotting(like Pet Semetary) and some brilliant direction make this one of the truly great films of the 1990's.

Pity about The Green Mile (1999)...",9
"Never has in mind that a live inside a prison is better than outside world, and never has in mind that hope is something that we can have even in the darkest moment. I can relate to every assuming guilty people through this movie, because losing brook has made my heart ache. This movie has given me motivation like a bird flying through the cage. I am very grateful to myself that i have chosen this movie over avengers, or else ""i have never seen a shoe of a man"". Sincerely, you dear friend",9
"One of, if not, the best movies I have ever come across. A very heart warming and inspirational film that never ceases to put a smile on my face no matter how many times I see it. Fill with memorable scenes and dialog. Acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman alone make this movie a great gem. The story is focused in a prison, but the focus of the film is hope, patience, redemption ( as in the title), and friendship. The movie contains a lot of symbolism, but it identifies itself quite clearly. I urge you if you call yourself a film fanatic to go watch this movie if you have never seen it. It has some the best characters to it.",10
"I would recommend this film. It has a good plot and in the end all the small things you never noticed all add up. So overall it's a good film. It has a good meaning to it which a lot of films nowadays lack. However during the first hour of the film I found it quite boring. It was as if the film was leading to something and although things happened it just didn't interest as me as much. In saying that the film really does have a good meaning which is why I like it so much.

Although I would recommend this film there are other films which have a similar meaning which I personally think are better.

I gave it 7 out of 10 simply because this film is above the average film but it's not exceptional.",9
"I enjoyed this film because it shows the way I believe our Judicial system should be;tough, and stern. The two main characters,Red and Andy, form a friendship bond that carries them through the ordeal of prison life. They stick together and help one another.The great scene I enjoy, is when Red comes up for parole and the last time, they set him free. The officials may have thought He served his time enough, and He was older anyway.Red gave a great speech, how he regretted what he did and was very sorry.When he said he would ""talk some sense"" into that guy who committed that crime,I think that moved the officials to change their minds.

Morgan Freeman is wonderful in this film and I love Robbins' performance,here.",9
"I hope you watch this film, and you are found better for it.

This movie is all about acting in the best interest of yourself and others, and the evil that checks our good motive. Morgan Freeman plays the role of a lifetime, and that's saying a lot because Morgan has had quite a few outstanding performances. I do think this was his best. The reason I think that are the extremes that Freeman's character goes through from utter despair (""somestimes all I can think about is ..."") to highest hope.

The movie does so many things well, but the two most important for me were Freeman's Narration as a whole (""tall drink of water"") and the use of the letter device through narration. Freeman narrating the letter which read,""I hope this letter finds you well,"" is one of the most pleasant lines I think I have even heard in any movie. It had to make Freeman's character feel better about ""his friend"" (though he may not have needed that), but it is as if Andy Dufresne knew that Red would be struggling, and he needed the feeling of calmness to get him through this period. The treasure hunt device and the physical scene of that device is movie making at it's finest. The shot up the hill to the tree (great focal point), the stone wall, it was all perfect.

I would that we all would find our friend on the beach of self content for fond embrace.",10
"Excellent, powerful drama about two mens' friendship and escape from Shawshank prison. Robbins and Freeman excel in perfect roles. Sharp script and touching subplots add to this enduring film. Freeman's narration illuminates beauty and power of Stephen King short story upon which it is based. Directed by Frank Darabont (""The Green Mile"").",10
"A movie is considered amazing when it not only entertains you but also teaches you something important about life. This movie taught me that Hope is the best thing you can possess in life. This is one of the most fantastically written and performed movies, I have come across. It is a true piece of Cinema.",10
"Fear makes you a prisoner, hope frees you, hope is a good thing, perhaps the best thing, and good things will never die. When someone committed suicide, I almost couldn't help crying. People live in fear is really very bad, out of harmony with the environment, fear everything around them, it feels like an invisible hand, pinching his neck at any time, if can't find an exit, mental breakdown, the rest is only despair I feel very gratified, even some lucky, Rhett was not defeated by this fear. I also want to thank Andy, who left a straw for Rhett in his life and death. The Lord loves the world. In front of the supreme Lord, everyone has original sin, and we repent to ourselves. Never give up hope, save yourself, save your soul.",8
"Expectation, freedom and friendship are the common beliefs and pursuits of mankind. As long as there is full of hope and firm belief, there will always be a sea waiting for us.",8
"It's so shocking that the male master escapes through the sewer. It has to be said that his obsession with freedom overcomes everything. Even if he stays in prison, because he keeps learning and doesn't break away from the outside world, he can face everything so calmly. Even in the small world of prison, he is the master himself.",9
"Grate movie !!!! I like it and its one of the Best movie in history.

"I consider a technically well made movie, good story with great actors, but nothing more. Use the melodic drama injustice, but not quite spectacular, as a masterpiece of cinema. I think a great movie for afternoon session, but not the level of movies that have the best score of all time. This I consider an injustice. This film has to have something else to be an excellent movie. I respect the majority opinion here, but I put my sincere considerations, here is a democratic space to put our feelings and emotions. Film is a passion, and I'm sure we'll be together to honest debate with many other films. I liked this movie, but without much enthusiasm, as in the comments here. For me, a movie only average ...",10
"Hope is a good thing as said by Andy and I hoped that I will like this movie again rewatching it after years. It still does , like s charm. No action , No VFX, No ott moments still in the 2020's this works like old wine. That moment when Andy breathes a sign of relief in the rain after escaping still gives you reason to live your life for. The climax too. After all these years it is surprising that the film didn't win a single Oscar award ,even though it stand against had equally great films ( eg- Forrest Gump ), but it doesn't matter now though ( but it also gives an idea on what a splendid year 1994 was for movies). What this has done in the future is history and it has emerged as one of the greatest movies ever made and ya it is still the highest rated movie on IMDb and I would still want to watch it again after few years to stay motivated in my life...",10
"This movie, based on a short stoy by Stehpen King, is easily one on the best movies made in the modern era of Hollywood. It incorporates a touching story of friends and hope, top-notch acting, excellent directing and most important; a screenplay worthy of high marks. With beautiful photography and a story that is best described as ""uplifting"". this is one of my favorite movies EVER. The best line in the movie goes ""it all comes down to one thing; get busy living or get busy dyin'"". A rating of 10 out of 10 was given.",10
"This movie was a little overrated, but it was still wonderful. What can I say that hasn't already been said. It was a lot like the Green Mile, only it has some more interesting plot twists and such. It had a great ending. It deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, and I enjoyed it more than Forrest Gump (which, I think won that year), but I think Pulp Fiction should have won that year.",10
"I expected The Shawshank Redemption to obviously exceed to some level of greatness as it's the highest rated movie of all time. The movie had me and i believe most people hooked from the beginning as it starts with a cliffhanger and a very stressed and confused man drunk in his car. The movie really shows the audience how police brutality and prisons were in the 40's, and how they used to treat people. I wish i could say something bad about the movie as i feel every movie or show you watch should have at least one thing to point on, but i feel the director of The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont) added everything that the film needed and for most people who have watched the movie succeeded expectations. If you are thinking about watching this movie I would 100% recommend as it's a movie i feel everyone should see at least once in their life.",10

"The Shawshank Redemption is not only the greatest film of the last decade, but in time, this may become, in the eyes of moviegoers, the best movie ever made. The story of wrongfully accussed banker Andy Dufresne, and his friendship formed with con Ellis Boyd Redding in Shawshank Prison, has become as universally acclaimed and loved as any other in recent history. This is the 'Casablanca' of it's time. A near-perfect movie that can be watched hundreds of times and never lose it's impact. Perhaps its the way the movie handles the timeless theme of hope, and the trials one man has to endure to be attain the proverbial redemption of the title. Maybe it is because this movie is truth, simple truth, about the triumph of good over evil, the triumph of reason over madness, the triumph of hope over everything.",10

"I never heard of this movie when I watch first time, I accidentally saw this movie running on TV and I started watching, it was night time , definitely the best experience that I can't forget. I have so much into the movie , it is so good. I always feel it is part of my life experiences. The movie deserve Oscar for all the category but sadly it didn't get even it is the best movie of the century, but it wins ppl heart anyway that is more than Oscar.",9
"I must say that this is the best prison films of all time. I couldn't believe that this film didn't win any Academy Awards. This film could have win at least one or two. Also, I thought that Tim Robbins could have earned an Oscar nomination. He gave a superb performance. But the one who was powerful in this film is Morgan Freeman. He gave one of the best performances that I have ever seen in film. It was heartwrenching. I like that tagline: Fear can make you prisoner, Hope can set you free. Frank Darabont did superb filmmaking in this film. By the way, I found out that Allen Greene, the person that Frank dedicated at the end, was the director's agent and his close personal friend. If you want to see a film that takes place in a prison or dramatic films, then see this film. You will never regret it. It is the best prison film since Midnight Express. SEE IT!",10
"I'd say this is the movie that got me into movies. It got me into more of my favorite movies such as Taxi Driver, Inception, Pulp Fiction, and so many other great movies. Morgan Freeman has to be my favorite actor in it, not to undermine Tim Robbins whose performance was compelling and beautiful. It does a great job of humanizing criminals and it has one of my favorite antagonists in any movie ever, except maybe the Joker in the Dark Knight or Candie from Django Unchained.",10
"Twenty years for freedom and hope. ""Shawshank redemption"" spiritual level of hard core, deep meaning and influence. A man's thirst for freedom is powerful. He can make a man chisel away at a wall. The good and evil in people's hearts are not increased or decreased by the loss of time or the change of environment.",10
Never met anyone who doesn't like this film and that's just testament to how good it really is,10
"Before watching this movie i knew that it would be good,but frankly speaking i had the prejudice of it being overrated.I was like ""How the hell can this movie be praised that much?It has to be good but for Christ's sake it can't be that good as people say!"".

Now,after having watched The Shawshank Redemprion i can say only one thing: Never,and i mean never,be prejudiced before watching a movie.Even if you have been disappointed by movies that the hype had made think they would be great.

Shawshank Redemption is perfect in every way.The acting,the direction,the soundtrack but most importantly this movie has the most beautiful and incredible story of them all.

People say that movies' significance for the viewer is not just one but many.I agree,they are made in order to amuse you,to relax you and take your mind away of the deadly everyday routine,at least for an hour or two.They are made also to take you in different ""worlds"" and make you see things from another perspectives.But in my book the major significance of movies to mankind is to pass him and remind life's most valuable things.

In this very film the value that is being radiated so to speak is hope.In fact the whole movie is about the thing that many people lose when they are in difficult situations,it is spelled h-o-p-e.And the way the movie promotes hope is so powerful that it changes you in a way,especially if you need it.

The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redemption is the most beautiful movie of all time and it fulfills the major significance a film can have in a human being's life.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""...",9
"8.5 out of 10 for clarification.

The first half of TSR hosts a handful of excellent scenes, high quality performances, some excellently crafted dialogue and cinematography. Despite this, in areas the drama still veers disconcertingly close to becoming tedious.

However, the final thirty minutes of TSR are where the film's true qualities become starkly apparent to the audience, as we are treated to scene after scene of emotionally power, devastating content.

However, I do not consider the film a masterpiece, and feel as though it falls short of this goal by a considerable margin. Therefore, the fact that TSR has garnered the fabled number one spot in terms of audience ratings on this site makes me question whether the judgement of the audience is too heavily influenced by the final act and not representative of the picture as a whole.",10
"First of all, this is a marvelous, uplifting film with wonderful performances from Robbins and Freeman, a superlative score from Newman, is by far the best King adaptation (although that's not saying a whole lot) and has many terrific and emotional scenes, but get real folks. This is not the best film of all time - not even close. It's not even the best of 1994 ('Pulp Fiction' gets my nod), let alone the best prison flick (I'll take 'Cool Hand Luke' thank you and, if you include POW films, 'The Bridge Over the River Kwai' and 'The Great Escape' are both much better). Just think folks. Better than 'Citizen Kane,' 'Casablanca,' 'Gone with the Wind,' 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Schindler's List' (which also could be considered in the prison category by the way)!? I'm not criticizing this movie - just the lack of perspective. It's definitely in the top 10 of the decade and probably in cine history's top 5%. That should be enough.",9
"I cannot deny two things: 1. Stephen King is the master of horror / suspense

2. If the crowd decides to like something, no matter what it is, there no way no one can stop it.

If you are irritated by the amount of votes of ""Shawshank redemption,"" perhaps you will find Akira Kurosawa´s ""Runaway train"" not so cliché prison film.",10
"This is one of the Best movie i have seen in my life till date! It actually shows you how to live a goddamn life. There are many messages lying in this film and the best 2 are known to you all. It actually showed me that life is not what we think it is! Its about going down Hundred times and getting back Thousand times! Life is always should be considered as Fighting with the Storm(sometimes it may be Tornado!). But once the storm is over, you won't remember how you made it through, or how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, whether the storm is really over or not. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in! That's what this storm's all about! It makes you totally a different person! So always Keep your Hope constant and Get Busy Living the Goddamn Life on your own! :)",10
"The young bankers in the film, with their mastery of bank finance knowledge, not only win the safety of life and some freedom for themselves, but also strive for the material and spiritual interests of their cellmates. It is also because of his mastery of finance that the protagonist finally completely defeats the cruel and sinister warden and gives himself material freedom. On the other hand, take a look at the six-year weekly application letter, the N-year application letter twice a week, the tunnel excavated day by day with the stone axe that ""can't dig the tunnel for 600 years"", the sewer pipe broken with stones in the thunder, the 500-inch smelly sewer crawling through as you vomit. All this deeply portrays a word: perseverance. Anyone who wants to finally gain freedom under the blue sky and white clouds must have these two kinds of talent and perseverance. I also finally realized why I am still depressed at present: first: when I was not able to do so, I liked to paint very much when I was a child, but when I grew up, I concentrated on reading sage books, the college entrance examination, and the brush was never mentioned again. I studied medicine in college, but my days of studying medicine were used by me to learn guitar and read idle books. After work, guitar has no time to practice, naturally abandoned. All along, I have practiced calligraphy, seal cutting, sketches, cartoons, photoshop, flash, Dreamweaver, horticulture on and off and on. And so on interested things, however, no matter which, is typical dabble, give up the reason although each is different, but speaking, in the end is unable to insist. So, I'm basically the kind of person who can do anything and can't do anything. Second: no perseverance can actually be seen from the above, so many hobbies, so many attempts, and finally stop at my halfway. If one thing can last for half a year, the results will be very different. I am the typical ""aimless person often determined"". I have a notebook for writing plans. I don't know if anyone else has such a book. I have to set up a small book like this, because every time I make that plan, I will update it. In fact, every time I make a plan, I hope I can keep doing it, but,. Knowing that I was not regular, so after the most recent plan, I solemnly wrote: ""I hope to last three months""-as a result, a month later, these words made me have no courage to look at the front when I wrote the new plan. I am ashamed to see the film reviews written for Shawshank's Redemption on Douban, and the incisive analysis of the plot, performance and connotation of the film. However, I hid in the side to secretly write this text. Even though my writing skills are poor, even if my mind is superficial, every small person has the right to have her feelings about everything-and it is such a beautiful thing. The film touched me so much that, for the first time, I knew why I had been working so hard, but I had been depressed. Maybe, someone and I feel the same way?",10
"Possibly the best role Tim Robbins ever took on, that of quiet and mild-mannered Andy Dufresne, a convict wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover.

In this situation, he meets ""Red,"" played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman, as well as all his friends including Heywood, Floyd, and Brooks, played by James Whitmore. Through the narration of Red we see the changes in Andy as he builds a huge library, helps young Tommy earn his High School Diploma, gets the cons some beer from one of the ""meanest screws to ever walk a turn at Shawshank,"" played again by Clancy Brown, one of the greatest living actors in film today. Through it all Andy also endures torture of a different sort from Warden Norton, a role of villainy played brilliantly as Robbins character by Bob Gunton. We see Andy as he goes from doing the tax returns to actually laundering the Warden's money. One of the most endearing lines: ""Outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to learn to be a crook."" This movie is as good as the Green Mile, if not better. And that's hard to do. From it we see hope in the eyes of the hopeless as Andy's actions give that to them. I give it a 10 out of 10, got out and get it today. I promise you'll love it.",10
"It really is difficult to find anything at all negative to write about this absolute cinema classic. If there is just one point that comes to mind perhaps it would be the apparent lack of visitors to see the inmates, though it might well be argued they would probably add little to this near perfect story. There, at least I have thought of something!! This movie dominates the mind in a way few others have ever achieved. The storyline unwinds in brilliant fashion, the playing by all the cast is beyond reproach, with Oscar-worthy performances throughout. I can think of no other film that tells the penal servitude story the way this does, and frankly can only finish by pleading to everyone that they really must see this monumental movie at least once in their lives. Magnificent.",10
"It's the most overrated movie of my life,not even one of the, it's ""the"".it has some good actors and dialogues and that's all this movie has to offer, its utterly boring,too long for such a stupid story, it deserves no more than 6* at all by no means.i have stopped taking movie recommendations from everyone who suggested me this movie",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie is film-making at it's best. It features superb acting, directing, and story. Every single shot in this movie was a good one, the camera worked wonders that the average eye disregards as they focus on the beauty of the film.

This is the story of a falsely convicted man, and his struggle for freedom. Beyond the already great fact that it was a prison movie set in the 40's through late 60's, it was written by Stephen King, one of the greatest fictional writers of the late 20th centruy. The best part about prison movies is the fact that it's always moving, always developing, never boring. There's just something about prison movies that make you feel at home, as odd as that sounds. And plus, the movie was full of great narration and dialouge, full prison similes that were so eloquent, you know only Stephen King could have written them. Shawshank is the kind of movie you could watch over and over again and never get sick of, like American Beauty or One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.

The movie just simply is perfect by every standard that we set. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.",10
"Freeman's character is more compelling, giving him a natural grace and dignity. It's a really good movie",6
"Loved the movie, watched it several times now and always see something new. Great human conflicts. Clever plot. Acting was superior. Catch myself thinking what it must be like to be in a prison every time I watch it. Could not do it. The movie draws you in and you can't help feeling like you a part of it. The interaction of the characters had so many levels of emotions tied to them. Can't imagine what people must feel when they are innocent and end up in prison Horrifying thought on so many levels. The ending was great, but I wanted to see more. wanted to know what their future was like. wanted to see it. I love the fact that the movie actually brought you to the reunion of the two main characters and how it played out.",9
"i dont know what to see about this movie that hasn't already been said. as good as movie as forrest gump was, the only major award it should have won over shawshank was tom hanks as best actor. an argument can be made for zemeckis for director, but seeing as shawshank redemption is such a better movie, and most of the movie takes place in location, (shawshank prison) i think darabont is robbed not only for not winning the oscar, but not even scoring a nomination. and seeing as he would be the best director, i would think that if you're directed your film best it would logically be the best picture. tim robbins is also robbed of a nomination, and i think hanks just edges him for that trophy. the biggest travesty of all is that shawshank doesn't even win any of the oscars it was nominated for. if you havent seen this film recently, go pop it in the dvd or vcr and just sit back and revel in its magnificence.",8
"Wonderful acting, good writing and a fantastic story provide for a classic that has kept up surprisingly well throughout the ages.

Well worth a watch even despite being an older movie.",9
"A faithful telling of Stephen King's novelette ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", this movie explores a wide range of emotions without ever feeling sensational or melodramatic. It's a really good story told really well on film (unlike a lot of King adaptations).

Tim Robbins is absolutely fantastic as the ""fresh"" inmate, radiating intelligence, courage, innocence, and mystery with equal ability. Morgan Freeman plays the wily veteran convict who forges a respectful friendship with Robbins, and since it's Freeman, you know he does a good job.

There's no special effects wizardry, no furious action, no steamy romance, no clever ""Pulp Fiction"" banter. It takes place virtually entirely in a prison, so there isn't much distraction with location, scenery, or movement. This movie is pure story and character, which really makes you appreciate just how amazing the performances are.

The movie is basically the gradual discovery of what Robbins' character is all about--what he's done, what's he's thinking, how he's going to end up. The strength of the acting, and the adherence to King's work does a superb job in making you sincerely care about the past and fate of this man.

There is also a good deal of subtle philosophical elements to the movie, which doesn't hurt. Certainly the penal system as we know it is questioned, but there is also a broader view of life itself, almost in the Victor Frankl ""Man's Search for Meaning"" kind of way, where the strength of the human spirit is tested to the extreme. What does it take to destroy hope and happiness?

There exists only a handful of movies that I'll ever rate a solid 10. This is easily one of them.",10
"Such a powerful story portrayed beautifully by the iconic duo consisting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

The Shawshank Redemption is a must watch movie. It's got one of the greatest and most satisfying endings to a movie ever, iconic and relevant quotes, amazing scenes, brilliant perfomances and that Morgan Freeman voiceover.

Tim Robbins delivers one of the greatest performances by an actor in a leading role as Andy Dufresne (possibly the best).

I rate The Shawshank Redemption so high (#3) because of how beautiful and emotionally captivating the storyline is. The only two movies i consider greater than The Shawshank Redemption is Schindler's List and The Lord of the rings trilogy.

10/10.",10

"Based on the Stephen King novella ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Of the many Stephen King stories that were made into movies, this is the truest adaptation. It was nominated and should have won best picture in 1993. The movie was cast perfectly with outstanding performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Clancy Brown.",7
"I have seen this movie several times, and have noticed things I hadn't noticed on previous viewings. This is the story of a man convicted of killing his wife. I hate spoilers, so won't list anything, you just need to see this movie. I did have a couple of issues with things that happen in the movie which is why its only 8 stars/",9
"Namely: I liked that movie.

Many people love it. I just like it. I like it VERY much.

Especially I like Tim Robbins. But the story is just mediocrate. Anyway, the director is very good and along with Tim and Freeman he is getting us involved. Few are critical, as usual, saying that there are used too many stereotypes, but what the heck - in this case!!! - it´s a brilliant movie anyway! Maybe it´s overrated and deserveres to be on 51th of the best movies of all time. Then what to do about Memento and LTOTR?? Do you want do put on a test on voters? Make them see true art as Bergmann, Hitchcock, Lubitsch, Wilder, Griffith, Ford, Capra, Zinneman, Coppola, Scorsese, Besson and Stroheim produced it frequently? No! It´s the sign of the times. The Internet is (still) ""new"" and the people who are using it are young or at their best in their middle ages. So let´s take their voting as what it is: a picture ot our own time. And be fair. If the younger generation likes it - they may be right!

After all: I REALLY liked it. 9/10 Macaulay J. Connor",10
This is a sad film. Its extremely good but its also black in the way that a brick wall in front of a motorway is dangerous. Until the last two minutes its an unrelenting depression. Bang! its sad (the sound of its dark feelings hitting my head.) I can't say anything about this movie. Its beyond good. It is FAULTLESS. Watch it! Then you try an review it.,10
"It is the best movie i have ever seen.Watched it 5 years back and was mesmerized. Just can't stop myself watching it again and again whenever it airs on TV or get a chance to recommend it to someone. Usually i don't like the movies based on this theme. i just watched it as it appeared on the top and believe me it blew my mind as i finished watching it. The storytelling, screenplay, direction everything is just awesome and cannot be better. I have seen most of the IMDb's top movies. some remain on top some loose, but this one can't be dethroned. As I am watching this for 10th time(which i usually don't do, and neither do I write reviews :)), it came in my mind to give this masterpiece a tribute by posting the review. If you haven't seen it, go watch it as soon as possible. you will remember the masterpiece for years.",9
"As someone who loves great movies, I must say this is my first review only because this film deserves every accolade it has received and will receive throughout the years....it is a rare priceless gem, a shining example of film perfection...I don't think I will ever see such a great film ever again in my lifetime. Everything comes together flawlessly in the movie, the actors, the plot, the direction, the cinematography, all of it producing a film for the ages....if Stephen King never writes another word, he and director Frank Darabont have given the world an amazing gift in this film...A sincere thank you just doesn't seem enough but you have my undying gratitude for this movie.",10
"I have no idea, why this movie has received such a good rating. It´s an average prison movie without any highlights. Typical Hollywood stuff. There are hundreds of better movies around. The movie drags, the actors are average. It´s just this typical ""heartbreaking"" stuff and far away from other movies up on this list.",10

"I am surprised at how many people have not seen this movie. It's spectacular. I have two favorite movies. This is one of them. I have friends who have no interest in seeing Shawshank, but after I make them watch it, they all love it. No exceptions. I can't believe Forrest Gump won best picture in '94. The Oscars lick.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a redemption story in which the main character committed no crime of which to be redeemed. Although the hopeful message resonates with audiences, The Shawshank Redemption is not the greatest movie ever made: Every character is a stereotype, the cinematography is bland, and the pace is slow.",9
"I was always wondered why this movie is the highest rated movie here well I know the answer now.

A really unique movie it's rare to see movies collide art with fun from my point of view being smart is about to make hard things easy and the movie did it pretty well.

Through special writing and Frank Darabont easy abstain style of directing which based on short story by the legend Steven king it used the narrative style of the Irishman whish the main character tells us his story his feelings which adds more depth to the character with Andy the embodiment of hope. All those factors helped the movie to be the best

Not just that the movie is loaded with a lot of amazing messages and it appears in everything nearly in the characters, in the music and the scenes it self the symbols are easy to get

Also Morgan Freeman gave the performance of his life this is my favorite character and this is the best performance I saw him give that doesn't apply to the others which I don't know anyone of them but they did awesome job in the supporting characters. You know the professional actor when his character don't get the proper introduction and he creates it's persona and let you interact with it.",7
"I'm glad that this and not ""The Dark Knight"" is considered the greatest movie of all time. TDK lost that battle if nothing else. And I love how you literally just cant stop watching this film once it begins, despite the fact that it offers the viewer no challenge whatsoever. The artistry here is not in the tale itself, but in the telling of the tale. Its a hope-in-the-face-of-tragedy fable, with a miraculous twist that turns the whole thing on its head. You are not meant to ask too many questions, else the whole thing falls apart.

The key to this film is the editing and the photography. The filmmakers have used the simplest possible visuals to frame the story. Two giants in the film profession lent their enormous talent to this production : editor Richard Francis-Bruce & cinematographer Roger Deakins. About 99.99 % of films rely on heavy-handed editing and camera gimmicks to tell the story, and ironically they fail. In this film you just don't perceive the role of the editor or the cinematographer, despite their continual presence. Watch how the narration, images and score are welded together in a flawless lock-step precision. There isn't a single false moment or an out-of-place/unnecessary scene; the vignettes are masterfully assembled into a seamless whole.

I'm afraid I cant give this film a 10/10 because it isn't better than dozens of other films that I've seen. In this world, events occur as the story needs them, not as they might in the real world. This is done so extraordinarily well that a passive viewer will NOT notice the tricks involved. And so it gives me almost nothing non-filmic to think about. But watch this film for its narrative mastery.",10
"There's a particular scene in The Shawshank Redemption where Andy is just sitting there listening to random opera music. Where Any feels free and full of hope. That scene full of brilliance defines the whole movie. If one analyzes this movie, many themes arise. A theme of hope, a theme of redemption, a theme of second chance, a theme of bonding or even themes of friendship. If you see the movie the first time, you see it through the eyes of Andy but the second time, one realizes it's really the story of Redd and his redemption.

Andy is a successful banker and is guilty of murdering his wife. He is sentenced for life in Shawshank Prison. During his sentencing he stumbles upon many inmates and one of them ends up being his friend Redd. During his sentencing Andy does taxes for the Guards and helps the warden in some illegal activities. The moments in those many years is what makes Shawshank.

The movie is full of unforgettable moments and unforgettable characters. All characters are well developed and well written. What works most is that the movie has a simple story yet the deepest meaning to it. The multiple themes are brilliantly depicted.

The climax is just heartwarming! The direction is flawless. Every sequence is brilliantly executed. It's a shame the Oscars ignored Frank Drabont.

Another plus point is the casting of the movie. Every actor suits the role to the T. Tim Robbins is just brilliant as Andy! He's nothing short of spectacular.

Bob Gunton is also another act to look out for. He's first rate. All the other actors are also flawless.

Having said that, a performance you take home with you is of the brilliant Morgan Freeman. It's really tough to describe in words how good of an act his was. One really wants to applaud him by the end of the screening.

Overall, Shawshank is a movie of a lifetime. Missing it is a crime!",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is a classically quiet film about the injustice served to one man and his consequent adaptive actions. Frank Darabont has shown true talent in the creation of this near-perfect modest film with most scenes showcasing deliberate quaint beauty. Emphasising the beauty of life through many mediums, some ethical, some not, this film really helps the viewer appreciate life and the little things. With a cast performing their roles perfectly, this uplifting and high-spirited film is a stand alone about every simple aspect of life and how it is approached. The Shawshank Redemption is a deserved classic.",9
"I've been thinking why is this movie The best movie for so many people, then I remembered it is like music, the best music is the ones you heard at 14. because you associate with memory and when your brain starts developing and your awareness of yourself and others come into being.

this movie revitalized my love for classical and baroque music no doubt and introduced some themes. I find the main character somewhat unrealistic only because I personally cannot relate to him. If I was in his position I doubt I would have done what he did.

It is good but I prefer Morgan Freeman's The Bucket List much more and a variety of prison movies(American History X) and TV series(Prison Break).",10
"Though predictable, at least for me, it's still an interesting show. For me seeing how close i can guess what will happen (and at times i've been dead on). But 2 things need to be dialed down (like most shows); the sex scenes are not needed for this show at all ( i don't WATCH TVshow to see sex scenes) and they need to dial down the gay \lesbian (though i personally prefer completely remove it) scenes, at least nothing more then hugs and holding hands.

I don't want to be grossed out WATCHING to man or two woman make out and ruin my enjoyment of the show. Why do they have to do that? Ruin good shows by putting in gross in things like man kissing man, woman kissing woman, zombies, ugly unreal monsters, and so on. When I watch a TV show, I want to enjoy it not to be grossed out. Which was also the only thing I didn't like about the fear factor, a bit off topic i know, is the eating gross stuff. That has nothing to do with fear, it's a gross factor and mine is really low when it comes to grow thing. Same with this show, I'd happily have given it 9 stars but the lesbians scenes were grossing me out especially the kiss with Bethany and her ""lover"".

Other then this show is great, plenty of action and suspense. If there were not sex scenes, no gross scenes (and i don't mean like no blood in the crimes scenes but as i just had explained), and a lil more mystery in what's gonna happen next and this show would be not just great but amazing.",10

"The Shawshank Redemption is unbelievably well executed. It is filled with emotion, a gripping storyline, and likable (and unlikable) characters. The ending may bring you to tears. Everyone should watch this film to remind themselves of what a movie should aspire to be.",10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine in this film that may be the best ever. Robbins plays a successful banker who goes to prison for killing his wife and her lover even though he's innocent. Freeman plays the convict that's guilty of his crime, but makes the best of his time and becomes Andy's (Tim Robbins) best friend. A shady warden, crooked, abusive correctional officers, and sex starved rapists all make his time more difficult.

Stephen Kings Novella was perfectly developed into a screenplay with the best adaptation I've seen. This film has no weaknesses, nothing I'd change, nothing I'd add or subtract. It's perfection in film making from the screenplay, the cast, and the director. It may change how an average person looks at convicts as it shows the softer side of many of them. You'll have empathy for those men whether they're guilty or not, and you'll hate the bullies who make Andy's life a living hell. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you will never forget the story of Andy Dufresne who entered Shawshank Prison a young man, and never faltered on his morality.",10
"I can understand how some people can feel that 'The Shawshank Redemption' feels underwhelming or bland, compared to other highly acclaimed movies. I guess having that notion that all classic films have to be complex, with a bunch of overarching themes can influence one's perceptions of what is supposed to be a quality film. I have learned that every director has a vision with its own distinctiveness that differs from other directors. Whether its small or large in its scope, sometimes that is not the point. Some directors want to prove something to make a point, while some just want to just make a story that's basically good, without the need to be over-politically or socially conscious to the point where it becomes pretentious.

And 'Shawshank' is basically that. A good simple story about one's will to hold on to hope despite how heavy the circumstances. Sure, some might not view it as realistic for a story about prison life, but applying to the concept of life in general is what fits and not if it rings true to how life in prison really is. It's a more of a 'life' film than a prison film. When one feels like they are in their own type of 'prison,' sometimes just having a friend to bring you a little freedom is all you need to feel free again, and that is a comforting message in all its beautiful simplicity.

With its 'floating on a cloud' atmosphere, it really has a soothing, calm, and tranquil atmosphere, despite the setting being a prison. This tone is what separates 'Shawshank' from other films and becomes its own distinct world and with that the film comes off feeling more hopeful than dark at times, and I think that's more than I can ask for from this great movie, at the end of the day.",10
"Shawshank redemption left me feeling human. Superb acting and masterful directing, and amazing music, and everything else crumbled together in one film that a person simply must watch.

I understand Darabont is a prison fan. Have only seen two of his films and both ar in prison (the second one is The Green Mile). I guess there is something extremely attractive about jails. How this place that seems so inhumane and cruel is full of real people in fact, who may have wronged during their lives, but they are real. They are able to love and hate and fight... This is represented through everyday detail of the film.

And then someone is thrown in who has the guts and the brains and who makes this prison life just a little better for the people there. He is extremely kind. In a way, the protagonist is very similar to the main character of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

Loved it. Awesome. Amazing!",10
You have to live this movie I didn't know it after watching it 10 times but finely I got the feeling Some masterpieces should be watched listened and read for 10000 times until they'd be comprehended completely Long night of prison You'll never get out No hope No fairytale But there might be redemption,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is considered one of the greatest films of the 90. The story talks about hope, the story of director (Frank Darabont) and the act of (Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman). The story is about( Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. )",10
"As a person who loves watching movies of different categories and genres, I could say that this movie could truly represent our planet earth in a right way to aliens (If they exist). With this, I would like to underline that this is a film that shows our humanity and the fact that a person could have patience of the highest level. I would recommend to everyone to watch this amazing masterpiece, even if you are not a cinema lover or as interested in cinematography as I am.",10
"OH MY GOD!, this was so heartbreaking to watch, almost in tears... I loved this film with my soul, and every second of it was super worth it. This is just a 10/10, once more proud of saying Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors ever! And this movie is by far the best.",10
"Yes, Utter perfection on celluloid.

Must see for anyone.",10
"Certainly not a masterpiece. Lacks in many areas. I can't count this movie even in my top 20 chart. The Shawshank Redemption and ""The Big Lebowski"" are the most overated movies in my opinion.",8
"I have seen this film over 25 times, it's the best film ever made. There is nothing bad about tit. Look forward to watching it another 25 times. Thank you frank darabont and everybody else that was a part of this absolute masterpiece. We should have a shawshank redemption day!!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is hands down the best movie of all time. I will type that again, Shawshank Redemption is the best movie.....EVER. Everything about this movie is amazing. This is Tim Robbins best work, Morgan Freeman is perfect as Red in every frame of the film and everybody else is great in their roles. Every time I see this film I love it just a little bit more and it still stands as one of the best examples of hope ever to be put on film. It also has one of the lines in film history, which I have quoted often in my life, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" So overall, a total Masterpiece. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5PyYKla1G8",10
"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.

But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.

Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.",5
"Oh man where to begin. This movie has it all. Easy to follow for both critics and normal viewers alike. This film has it all. The performances are amazing, especially Morgan Freeman. For God Sake he even narrates it. This film deserves the top spot on IMDb for sure. The story is great, and it really gives a great look at what prison can be like and how it can affect a man. It also has one of the most satisfying endings in film history. Stephen King may be a creepy guy but boy does his books make incredible movies. I recommend this movie to literally everyone (except small children) who are looking for an emotional, heart-warming, tear-jerking, amazingly created movie.",10
"Shawshank redemption is a epic movie in the history of cinema. It can be watched infinite times. The friendship,hopes of redemption is put together nicely. The background are stunning. The places in the film are exceptionally marvelous which takes you to another world.No other film in the world has this much message. It should have won more than 7 oscars. hypocrisy of Oscar Ultimately the best movie.",10
"In my subjective opinion, Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best movie and my personal favorite... But this movie, this movie is just soooo good... While it is not my favorite movie, it deserves the title of ""Best movie of all time""...

It's never Boring, the characters are fun and relatable, and the motivations are just AMAZING!

This movie is worth a watch, any time",9
"There are a lot of movies that tell us something important. But this movie is different from those. If we put all movies on one line,this one can't be put on it. We all should see this movie at least once in our lives.",9
"Okay,...I just watched this film for probably the 20th time, and I could probably watch it a hundred times in a row and not get sick of it. This comment is directed towards anyone who has not seen this film:

GO...

NOW...

I have LITERALLY dragged people off the street and sat them down in front of my television when I've found out that they haven't seen this film. And, I have not,...to date...met ANYONE who didn't like this film. There's not really anything bad that you CAN say about it. It's just a beautiful story, beautifully portrayed....

Go...

NOW...",10
"Well, more than two thousands comments and mostly positive why I need to write the comment for the simple reason I wants to pay a small homage to movie making and proving to the world that still every now and then Hollywood still come-up with rare gems. I watched this movie so many times and every time I sit through this movie from start to end which is quite rare these days to stick to a movie for more than 2 hours without feeling the patches of boredom or feeling the movie being bit long. I am still not sure what happen to Oscar which don't give best actor award to Morgan Freeman or best supporting actor award to Tim Robbins, well its really unfortunate. There is a saying about great movies, that great movies just made themselves and that's about it, you cant just make them again and again and among several of those great movies this movies will always stands. Frank Darabont will always be remember for his two outstanding work one is The Shawshank Redemption and another The Green Mile.",10
"Well-acted, well-directed, powerful and thought-provoking, The Shawshank Redemption encompasses all of the above, as it tells the incredibly inspiring story of friendship and hope. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine in their roles as inmates who develop a remarkable bond during their imprisonment, facing the struggles of prison life together and ultimately finding redemption. Although it focuses on a very familiar theme, The Shawshank Redemption stands out from the rest of the films in its genre, mainly due to the extremely intimate portrayal of its characters it has to offer. The film successfully uses its prison setting as a lens for society, and manages to present the audience with important life lessons throughout the storyline. Although not designed as a film of epic proportions, its nature does have an immense emotional impact on the viewer, which makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time.",10
"One of those movies that always seems to be on some channel and I always end up watching it. A movie almost entirely comprised of men enduring prison and corruption and surviving rape and attempted murder offers something surprising, hope.",10
"I will start my review off by saying that this film is very slow to start off. I'd say the first 30-45 minutes of it are very slow, and almost boring. BUT, that is about the only negative things I can say about this film. From that point on it is an absolute thrill ride. I would sit behind my computer and say to myself, ""Next scene I'll turn it off. Next scene I'll go do something."" And I never did. Something just kept me there, needing and prying to find out what would happen in the next second, and the one after that, and the one after that. The film seems to be building up exponentially to the ending climax, which delivers in phenomenal fashion. Not often do I get emotional about films, but this one almost did it. Absolute must see for anyone looking for a feel good film.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption doesn't deserve 10.. it goes beyond all ratings.. such movies come once in a lifetime.. and I can say, undoubtedly, that this is the best movie I've watched so far .. across all languages!! Makes u go deep down into ur soul.. makes u realize the true meaning of freedom.. makes u realize the importance of being hopeful!! It's 2019 and I'm definitely late in watching this movie.. but better late than never!! Truly beautiful..",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is nearly poetic, but misses slightly because of its straight-forward telling. That isn't a flaw really. It's just that considering some of the powerful human emotions and grandiose spritual scenes displayed, the film could have been legendary. Still, this film is destined to be a classic and rightfully so. Stephen King hasn't written another story that was better (Title ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" in the book ""Diffrent Seasons"" which also contains ""The Body"" which was made into another great movie, ""Stand By Me"" starring River Phoenix). Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman are outstanding. Drama rarely gets muchs better than this and the solitude of human existence is depressingly displayed here. Wonderful, wonderful!

Oh yeah, Morgan Freeman's explanation for being named ""Red"" is probably one of the purely humorous things you'll ever hear.",10
"This film appeals to anyone, thats why its #2 on IMDB. This film for some reason made only 28 million at the box-office. I love Forrest Gump I really do, but this is the best picture if the year. It has some sorta quality that is rare in films that instead of pulling you away, it draws you closer. The 30th time you watch this film, you will still be drawn in closer. The film is magical. Don't ever forget that.",10
"This is one of my all time favorite movies. It's about a man who is sent to prison for killing his wife, only he claims he didn't do it. He then makes friends with the inmates.

It is a long movie, but watching it, you wouldn't know. It feels like it was a few minutes long. As a plus, it doesn't even feel like a movie. The characters are so well played, you think someone was filming them for some reality show or something (cthe camera angles are amazing, no reality show-like parts like on Law and Order). This is a great movie, though not for all. It is a prison movie and has the cliché moments like the guards being cruel and things like that (everyone claiming to be innocent saying ""The lawyer F***ed me!"") It has actually convinced millions all over the place not to commit suicide or to stop cutting themselves and even leaving violent husbands/wives. This is a movie Everyone should TRY and watch.

Recommendations: The Green Mile

Road to Perditon",10
"The movie is just excellent, I really liked the plot of the movie and Akshay Kumar's acting. I'm sure it will be a success, the sensational movie. Super Top!! I recommend!!",8
"This film is truly magnificent and if there is anyone out there who hasn't seen it they should get straight down to their local video shop and buy it because it is the sort of film that you will want to watch over and over again. There is no acting in any other film that comes close to Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman. I fail to see how anyone could fault any part of this film it is, in my opinion, perfect. The plot line is great and there is no way you could guess what is coming next and the ending is completely unpredictable.",8
"I did not think this was a bad film I just think it's a bit overrated but everyone has there own opinion and that's fine. I thought the writing was amazing and it had some genuinely good shots and it was also very moving. This compared to Stephen kings other adaptations Stand By Me, The Shinning, Christine it just wasn't as good as those at least in my opinion. But I did like it and I do recommend it seeing as it's kinda a must watch for film lovers like myself.",10
"I was wondered while seeing the top rated imdb movies list that what is so special about this movie which makes it stand at the top #1 rated movie,but after watching it I will definitely say that this movie has each and every right to be in no.1 spot what a pure classic cult film,the best it's a guide to the the entire society and ppl hatts of to the whole team.!!!!!",10
Awesome movie 👍. Must watch movie. Acting is superb. How this movie underperformed at box office i don't understand.,8
"I saw this movie for the first time a year ago. In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked #2 in the top 250. That was very weird for me because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. So I decided to go and rent it immediately. After watching the movie I was positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top 250 and the wake-up call!",10
"There's a reason this movie has been among the top 3 movies of all time for nearly 20+ years on IMDB.

New movies come and go, but The Shawshank Redemption continues to be the highest rated movie around the world - and that's because it's a story of redemption, friendship and the reality of society told in a way that cuts across all cultures/beliefs.

If you haven't seen this movie, watch it now. It's set in an older time, so the movie never really shows its age even though at the time of writing this the movie is nearly 30 years old.

It's brilliantly acted, very emotional in ways that don't rely on cheap pandering and the music is brilliant. Might be the only movie that I've rated a 10.",10
"I can't help but feel emotional every time I see this film. Both Robbins and Freeman are excellent, and the supporting cast is good enough not to screw anything up, but they aren't spectacular.

One of the few complaints I have about the film is that it does get slow at times, and I find myself becoming a little bored. Another complaint I have is I wish the makers of Shawshank would give credit where credit is due for the amazing amount of scenes and ideas taken from Escape From Alcatraz, starring Clint Eastwood. How can so many critics claim that Instinct is derivative while none of them mention the fact that Shawshank Redemption is one of the most derivative movies of all time? Shawshank is significantly better than Alcatraz, and it does have important emotional elements that Alcatraz is void of; but a theft is a theft, and that won't change unless the makers of Shawshank start giving credit to Alcatraz. Here are some of the things stolen:

The digging tool being kept in a carved out bible and the somewhat funny irony that that entails.

The rapist encountering the star in the showers near the beginning of the film to set up further encounters.

An inmate at mealtime asking the star whether he will be eating something and then pulling out a small animal. I'm sure most Shawshank lovers thought that the whole bird thing was a completely original symbolic idea. Sorry, but even though the symbolism is well taken, it was FAR from original. The whole idea probably started with the mealtime animal scene, as it was obviously a direct steal.

The digging debris being emptied out of the star's pants during strolls.

The star befriending the black guy who can get you anything. True, Red is a much more important character, but this is definitely part of the theft.

There are several others that I have forgotten. And if Instinct had any cliché's, Shawshank certainly did, with the evil warden, the evil guard, the religion, the ""highly intelligent"" star, and the concentration on the ""hole"", where the star is always sent to burn for a while.

Despite all of this, I really do like Shawshank Redemption and will probably watch it many times in the future, but it absolutely amazes me that I have not seen or heard one single critic mention the robbery here. And as people became critic-following sheep with Instinct, they certainly did with Shawshank.

"Having just seen this wonderful movie, the question I ask myself is this: why in the world did I wait so long?? Based on a memorable short story by Stephen King, 'Shawshank' is a quietly brilliant parable about hope and perseverance and, yes--as stated in the title--'redemption.' Tim Robbins gives a beautifully understated performance as Andy Dufresne, a well-to-do banker sentenced to two double life terms in prison for a murder he did not commit. At first quiet and introspective, Andy slowly emerges as silently headstrong, resourceful, and filled with a sense of humanity that transforms not only himself, but his fellow inmates as well. Most effected by Andy's presence is his prison friend and ally, 'Red' Redding (played with a superb weathered dignity by Morgan Freeman), who acts not only as the narrator and Greek chorus in the film, but also as the collective conscience of the inmates themselves. Although the 'Mean Warden' might seem a stock character in prison films, Bob Gunton gives the role a new benchmark, oozing evil with every tight-lipped glare and succinctly uttered syllable. Having read the story by King several years ago, I knew the outcome, but, watching the movie, it was no less wonderful and gratifying when it arrived. The 'double ending' of this film--that is to say, what becomes of Andy and Red in turn--leaves the audience trembling with satisfaction and pleasure: redemption only comes with honesty; hope is eternal; and music (be it Mozart or Hank Williams) is magic. For those who have not yet seen it, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a 'must see'--for those who saw it years ago, take another visit. And then, during the closing credits over Thomas Newman's lovely score, do what I did--applaud.",8
"I can honestly say that Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is my favourite film of all time. It is simply perfect and it is criminal in my opinion that it missed out on so many Academy Awards in 1994.

Inspired direction from Mr. Darabont is complimented by superb performances from every member of the cast, which includes Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler and the menacing Clancy Brown.

Based upon a Stephen King novel, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the story of banker Andy DuFresne, imprisoned for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover. As life in prison begins to take it's toll, DuFresne (Robbins) befriends prison ""fixer"" Red (Freeman) who is understood to be 'a man who knows how to get things'. In truth, there isn't really a definitive storyline, the film merely chronicles the trials and tribulations experienced by DuFresne over his life imprisonment, during which time he becomes a financial advisor to the prison guards and makes friends in high places, although the Warden Norton (Gunton) has other plans for his talents.

A dynamic twist in the tale is the perfect finale to this exceptional film of which there is not a bad word to be said. The 2 hrs 17 mins simply flies by and by the end this magnificent story of courage, friendship, loyalty and ultimately hope will leave you feeling warm, extremely satisfied and ready for another viewing. A beautiful movie.",6
"The best movie I have ever seen, every detail and every dialogue comes down to the heart, every line is classic! Knowledge alters your fate! One after another! Those close to Zhu are close to those who are black! Water can carry a boat and it can overturn!",10
One of the greatest films of all time. It absolutely has aged like fine wine. Never gets old. There's not a whole lot of movies that are on par with the excellence of Shawshank Redemption.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption has taken place as my number 1 favourite film. I was really looking forward to seeing this and when I did, I knew I was in for a treat. This is easily the best film ever made. It's very moving and inspiring. This movie has no action scenes, just men in a prison who chat but not for one second i was bored. Frank Darabont is a great director, as he also made The Green Mile. The fact that this didn't win the seven Oscars it was nominated for makes my blood boil. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very memorable performances in their roles. The narration, the direction, everything is flawless. The ending is very heart-warming and happy.

This is the best book-to-movie adaption I've ever seen. Infinity times better than The Cat in the Hat (as that is the worst film I've ever seen.) It doesn't surprise me that it is #2 on the IMDb top 250. i recommend this to everyone who hasn't seen it. As said in my summary and the start of the review, it's not only my favourite film of the 90's. It's my favourite film of all time. You know, I'm giving this 10/5. It's just that good.",7
"I never thought one's perspective of life would affect me immensely The movie starts little boring but after some time it takes up Acting- Everybody was good 5/5 Story- our protagonist is a Bank employee who is accused of killing his wife and her lover His life in Prison is the main plot film This is not normal film ,it will make you cry ,laugh and of course Sad Cinematography-For films it was not revolutionary in filmmaking it didn't try anything new in cinematography Other- tbh everything was well done that i have no complaints Conclusion- if you are still thinking should i watch it or not ? Just go and watch ,Thank me later Stop wasting your time reading reviews Just go and watch . . Tl:Dr- A must watch , watch it now or regret it later

Tip-Dont watch trailer or any other spoilers of the film just watch movie",6
"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.

How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell.",10
"I'm not a fan of violent prison movies and I certainly don't watch them twice. Shawshank Redemption is the first exception to that rule. I have to admit, that I hated the few violence scenes and the shooting, but in this movie it was necessary to convey the message of hope. Although I think that this is a wonderful, touching movie, I think it's also a fairy tale. Everything that happens to the main character is an exception, rather than a rule which weakens the movie.

Other than that, it's a marvelous story about friendship, survival and hope. Watch and see for yourself how a person survives hell on earth.",10
"This is a story about the despair of life in prison, as well as the friendship and hope that can be found and maintained within its walls, against all odds.

As mentioned above, and as far as I am concerned, this movie is the best of all time. I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, and it touches me every time I watch it. As a matter of fact, I just finished watching this movie on television, on a cable channel that cannot seem to get enough of showing this film. I'm sure you know the one I mean, because they have shown this movie dozens of times, usually back to back. If you are a fan of this film, I'm sure you watch it every time it is on, much like I do, and are always amazed, yet again, at the end of it.

This film is written so eloquently that I doubt much could top it. Having not read the original short story by Stephen King (which is titled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption""), I cannot comment on the accuracy of the movie in relation to his telling of story. However, I'm sure that it does justice to King's writing. Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed Shawshank, also wrote the screenplay for and directed King's other prison film, The Green Mile, which also should not be missed.

The acting here is excellent, but I doubt anybody would be surprised at that, given the cast present here. Morgan Freeman (Se7en, Deep Impact, Kiss The Girls) has shown time and time again that he is one of Hollywood's best and most underrated actors, and he certainly shines here as Red, the man who ""knows how to get things."" Freeman's narration is superb, I doubt a better job could have been done by anyone else. In the history of film, people such as James Earl Jones and Martin Sheen never fail to provide narration that is highly eloquent, but this film shows that Freeman deserves to be in the same category as those two actors. Tim Robbins does a great job as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who knows he will remain in prison for a long time to come, but refuses to give up hope.

Despite excellent writing and acting, however, I believe the most poignant thing about this film is the score. Present at the best times, and lacking when it should be, the use of the score for this film helps set the tone and the mood for almost every scene. Obviously, in a film set in a prison, there isn't much happiness to go around. However, certain scenes in this film are defined by the score that goes with them, making the viewer look twice at a scene which would otherwise be quite drab and seemingly unimportant, and making them appear different than they are, thus impressing the theme of hope on the viewer in an almost subconscious fashion.

Historically, of course, this film will never be viewed with the respect and honor it deserves, especially with newer, more appealing prison-based films available, such as the aforementioned The Green Mile. It is unfortunate that Shawshank didn't win the Academy Awards it was nominated for, because it certainly deserved them. However, during its Oscar year, it was up against a little Tom Hanks vehicle called Forrest Gump, a movie which held back most others that year, and deservedly so. As often happens, seemingly to avoid one particular film taking home all the gold, Oscars were awarded to other films over Forrest Gump that year in various categories, and it's too bad that Shawshank wasn't one of them.

I guarantee that you will love the characters of Andy & Red, along with the interaction between them; hate Warden Norton and his sniveling sidekick Captain Hadley; and be moved by the eloquent ending of this fantastic and unforgettable film. It truly is an experience not to be missed.

10/10, and I'd give it an 11 if I could.",10
"Let me try. As a former Cop injured on the job in 1998 it's sometimes easy to despair. For many of us It's almost as if, we cannot see the blessings in our life unless they are taken from us or we lose them. This movie is about Hope. That's what makes this movie so special. there is a deep lesson in this film and like a work of abstract art, it's what you chose to take from it that makes it whatever it is. For me it's the message that no matter what, it isn't over till it's over. And to quote the film. Get busy living or get busy dying. That's a message. I'm going to try to live it out. Also the entire cast are incredible in their roles.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is such a powerful example of how people can overcome any hardship, and it gives fantastic insight on the value of time and how its never too late to live. Encapsulated in the line ""Get busy livin, or get busy dyin."" With powerful performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this is a once in a lifetime film expirience",8
Finally watched this movie and it certainly lives up to the hype. Fantastic movie with some of the best acting that you will see. The two leads are really fantastic.,9
I Thought To Myself At First When I First viewed this movie it wasn't at all going to be any worser than most movies i've seen. But I was wrong. It's the best adapted movie of all time and I think I ought say it's the best movie I've ever seen since The Dark Knight. I haven't seen The Godfather Francise Yet but don't really want to now that I've seen The Shawshank Redemption the very best movie and the top of my favorite movie lists. It's powerful and jaw-dropping and can get very emotional at times and the best thing about this film is Tim Robins the best actor of all time and Morgan Freeman clearly the main character of the film. The bad guys are the captain of the guards Mr Hatley I remember and Norton the Worton the biggest assholes I've seen in a movie that can drive you insane. And also Brookes and the guy with the beard around his cheeks can't remember his name they were good too. Best Movie of all time period 10/10,10
"It is a great movie which received 7 Academy award nominations but lost to eventual winner Forrest Gump and ranked 1# on IMDb.So there was enough curiosity to watch this one.

It is a very intelligent film in terms of story telling.The director deserves kudos for extracting such fine performances from his lead pair,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman who received Academy award nominations for their respective roles. Now the main question is does it deserve the top spot on IMDb.Well,the immediate answer is NO.The Godfather may be superior to The Shawshank Redemption by all means but it manages to hold its own and is complete as a film.Shawshank is a treat for the viewers.Do watch it for its gripping story well told.",7
"There's a reason it carries a 9.3(currently lol) on IMDB. This movie is almost perfect to me. A shame really, it ran into the buzsaw of Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction for Oscars. Because this movie is a masterpiece straight up. Also, the director(Frank Darabont. Look him up) doesn't ever get nearly enough credit. Much like this awesome film.",10
"I have seen over 5000 films in the last 30 or so years. and as an amateur film critic, I am among the thousands (maybe millions) of movie buffs who also recognise that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one film that should be rated higher by film critics and be given more appreciation. It is superb!! entertainment!! However! to be ranked higher than The Godfather,Citizen Kane,The Seven Samarai,Raging bull,etc, What gives? If anybody can share with me their reasons for saying that this is THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME?...over some of the films that I just mentioned, please explain. Am I missing something??",10
"This film has got to go down in history as one of the best films made. Heart warming story. Enticing characters and beautiful friendship.

It features Morgan freeman who is a legend within himself.

All round great film. I would recommend you to watch it, I tell you too.",10
"I read the short story by Stephen King and I absolutely loved it! This movie really pays tribute to both the writer and the story! There are some minor differences but they are an improvement to the screen.

I think just like M. Night Shyamalan is not just 'the master of suspense and plot twists', Stephen King is not just a horror and mystery genius. I think, in the end, all his stories (even the most dark and gloomy and disturbing) are about HOPE. This movie really shows that!

The story is not just about redemption but about friendship and hope.

I really recommend it! I think this is the best screen adaptation of a Stephen King novel / short story and that includes The Shining.

They only minor thing I would have changed about the movie is, if I have to nitpick, loose the 'THE'. I think ""SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION"" would have been a more powerful title.",10
"This truly has to be the greatest film ever made. This film has you hooked from beginning to end and never loses its edge. And to think that it came from ""Stephen King"" although this is not the first time King has given us such a great flick (""Stand By Me"", ""Misery"", ""The Shining""). Whats more unbelievable is that it was snubbed of the Best Picture for both the Oscars and Golden Globe. Sure ""Forrest Gump"" was a great film but it's not often that you find a movie so captivating and can have such a beautiful, edgy and realistic storyline. Even the AFI's ""100 movies 100 years"" didn't include this in their list. Both critics and audiences have had positive things to say about this movie. I think that if you haven't watched it yet, then you truly can't understand what true movie-making is all about.",9
"It's been a long time since it released, but it's still the best movie ever for me.",10
"It makes me wonder how people can bash this movie and then rate such mediocre films above it. One thing we have to remember - yes, it's rated #1. Why? Because it is rare to find a person out there who hated it. Thus, it makes sense that it is ranked #1 - it has the highest AVERAGE RATING of all films voted upon here.

I loved the movie. And I didn't think that it was that hard to believe that there are men in prison who regret their crimes - much less that there were men in prison in the 60s that regretted their crimes.

Incredible that people use this space to rip on the movie because of it's number one status instead of giving it an honest review. Love it or like it, Shawshank is a good movie.",9
"Here is a Film that shows you how vicious, and how humane, humans can be. Andy and Red are 2 of the most honest and memorable characters ever made, next to Dr. Strangelove and Charles Kane. If u want to see real human drama at its peak, see the Shawshank Redemption at least 2 times.",10
A marvelous film that reaches in and touches your heart like no other movie has done before. After I watched this movie I was so moved by it that I sat there and stared at the screen after the credits rolled up. That is how excellent this movie is. This is a movie that everyone in the universe should see. An absolutely incredible film. An easy 10/10,9
"This movie is quite simply one of the greatest of all time. I have never felt for characters in a movie like I have in this one. It would have won the Academy Award for best picture if it weren't for Forrest Gump. I love that movie too, however, I think Shawshank is a more enduring movie. It's tale is more about the human spirit, and overcoming probably one of the most difficult situations anyone could ever face.",10
"I Thought this movie was the most amazing movie I've ever seen next to The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, i don't know why its not there next to The Shawshank Redemption. I've watched this movie now a fair few times and on the special features on the DVD i seen the Director goes onto this site IMDb. And he also said that His movie has been in the top of the charts for years now been switching up and down between The Shawshank Redemption And The Godfather. I Think The Shawshank Redemption should be at number one because its just a pure inspiration to the movie industry and it should have a cinema anniversary or something with its 15th anniversary or something, i thought this movie was pure brilliant and i see everyone else nearly everyone else thinks the same, But it seems the director has only made one film that has been descent after this which was The Green Mile. That was good but not as good as The Shawshank Redemption, But good. Its seems the Director is an expert at Prison Films because he hasn't done well with his other films only 'The Shawshank Redemption And 'The Green Mile'. I Still think he's a really good director. I Own it on DVD and Own The Soundtrack, its brilliant , i love the songs from it. Anyway thats it, I Hope to make a film like this in the future as though I'm only 17 living in Ireland, The film industry in Ireland is rubbish so i struggling to get ideas of what i can do to push myself to an idea that could give me the lift tha ti need to star my film career alight, I Love films so much. Anyway thats it , I LOVE this film. PS . Sorry for the bad spelling i had typed a bit quick. Bye, Email me if your as interested in film as i, Or possible the director, if your looking at this could you email me, gives us ideas man, Cheers. , zkeveoz@hotmail.com Thanks Kevin Walsh",8
"So many years have passed, every time I watch this movie again, I will be immersed in it, not to say more, this is always my favorite movie.",10
I didn't get why this movie was rated #1 but now I do this movie is wonderful beautiful spectacular any name in the book the acting is amazing it's intense it's heart wrenching when it needs to be horrifying when it wants to be and heartwarming in every way at the end. This movie is a certain tear jerker and is probably THE BEST redemption story I've watched in movie history I love it.,10
"This movie made me realize that I movie is not just a moving screen. This movie shows us love of two friends to an extreme limit. A story of betrayal, prison and a hope of redemption. The Golden quote ' Fear can set you prisoner, Hope can set you free. ' I will call it 'Quote of the Decade'.

Can't believe this movie snubbed at Oscars and Box office.

Truly I love this film more than any other film.

Truly remarkable and unforgettable masterpiece.",7
"does it come off as a great movie? Perhaps, but I still think that other than the fact that this movie's premise was a ripoff of ESCAPE FROM ALCATRAZ (made in 1979..a full 14 years before Shawshank).. I guess it's still not bad. It is an interesting story, albeit not entirely true, or false. Yes, there was a prisoner who dug his way out of an alleged impenetrable prison. Yes, there was the usual bad warden who could make your life miserable and did when you did not tow the line. What Stephen King did was change the timeline(1950's) and the digging. You never see Tim Robbins character digging! You get an idea he might try it but upon first viewing the movie, you really have no clue except the feeling he is up to something! He is just to smart not to have a plan. Afterall, he is the prison accountant and personal investment broker! So in the end, the audience was just as surprized as the warden at the discovery of his amazing escape!

In ""Escape from Alcatraz"" we see the digging and the entire plan unfold..so what is left for us to enjoy is the satisfaction of seeing that jerk of a warden get what's coming when the prisoners break out of the Rock! Stephen King created a great piece of work and the director made it work as great cinema. So it doesn't come off entirely as a remake of a similar type of prison break movie but a character study of 2 men who desperately want out and some who don't. But I thought you all ought to know where the original story of digging thru a prison wall came from.

To me the twist was Tim had to swim thru 500 yards of crap and Clint Eastwood had to swim across a freezing San Francisco bay! Whereas Shawshanks characters end up free, happy and in paradise, we never will know if the Alcatraz prisoners survived the swim across the freezing SF bay..it's still",10
"To me, for a movie to be in the Top 10 all-time, it has to hold up to

repeated viewings. This one does not. I can watch Jaws, City Slickers,

Goodfellas, Titanic, everytime they are on because they exude a certain

feeling of a certain time and space. I am sure everyone here has movies

that do that to them. Yes, I enjoyed Shawshank Redemption immensely when

I first saw it. I was suprized at the ending and found it holding my

attention throughout. But just like Usual Suspects, after you know the

ending, and the cat is out of the bag, so to speak, the movie becomes

just a collection of characters and acting. And unless you are

mesmerized by the performances, the movie just loses it's appeal. Unlike

movies that have more of a attitude or aural feel to them where you get

caught up in the ambience of the movie(stuff like City Slickers,

Godfather, Goodfellas, Chinatown..) this movie just doesn't hold up

based strictly on the performances. I love Morgan Freeman and will watch

most anything he is in, especially Driving Miss Daisy and Seven. It

amazes me how this movie is considered the #2 movie alltime by this

Family Movie Night No.3. My choice and I went big. Unanimously voted the full ***** So pleased that our 13 year old daughter loved it too. Still a brilliant movie after multiple watches. I was lucky enough to actually watch it in the cinema.,10
"One of the best movie I have watched the story lineup is awesome. This should be the number 1 preference movie of anyone and everyone should watch this movie a time in his or her entire lifetime.

Best line of the movie was "" Some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was sin to lock them up does rejoice.""",10
"And searching for the light at the end of the tunnel, then watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"", you will be doing yourself a favour. That's it, I'm not going to talk about how good the movie is, as it has all been said before.",8
I don't know why people even bother making movies when this film exists. Any writer and filmmaker worth their salt will not be able to sleep going mad trying to create what this film was able to achieve. The greatest written film ever made.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption takes depth in the basis of human communication; perception. Before the ending of the film, the viewer takes on almost a similar perception towards Andy as Red as the story is from Red's point of view. However, at the end of the film, the viewer learns that what we perceive about somebody or something, may turn out to be something else at the end of the day. If you do not want to waste time watch this movie.",10
"Man does not have to accept the arrangement of destiny, nor does he have to resist the arrangement of destiny, but when the destiny occurs, see his own character clearly and understand why he is at the threshold of destiny. Only when you understand yourself can you make the most appropriate choice in front of fate. In fact, the end of life, whether good or bad, being a boatman, or being a banker, is nothing but a different model of fate. What really matters is that becoming a boatman or banker is a willing choice. There is no good saying in life. Everyone has his own unique definition of goodness deep in his heart. He really chooses to conform to his heart and will eventually reach that end point. It is a pity that most of us use other people's definition of goodness to set our own lives. Those moments that accompany our inner conflicts remind us of the current choices are problematic. While we resist to face this conflict, we try to rationalize the inner conflict in various ways while using the willpower The way to force yourself to continue to move forward with conflict. Dear friend, are you like this?",9
"Shawshank Redemption is the type of movie that all prison movies should be. In fact it is the type of drama that every drama should be. To date I can't think of a film that has just as much or even more character development than this film. And what better place to have it in? Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make this movie what it is through the characters. Through Robbins, we can see a character who is determine and will never give up. And through Freeman we see a man who knows the truth about life inside and the bold truth. We see most of that through Freeman's reflection in his role as the narrator. I love everything about this film. The cast, sets, characters, scores, script, everything. There are only a few movie that are just as good as this; but shouldn't be compared because like some movies in the film industry because it is the key to cinematic brilliance.",9
"Don't watch this movie, you will never see anything better and any other movie will disappoint you somehow. This movie is perfect and you can't imagine anything better.",1
"I just don't get it. It's not that I think this is an awful movie or anything, but no.2? Look at the rest of the movies in the top 10. Does it REALLY stand comparison with the Godfather or Seven Samurai? I think not. It's a manipulative, sentimental Sunday afternoon movie, raised above B-standard by some quality turns by talented actors. Nothing more. And who cares whether Andy could put the poster back in place or not. It's a patently ridiculous 'escape' to begin with. I understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob, but the fact is I love Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and other 'blockbuster' movies. But if you're looking for a genuinely affecting drama, this doesn't cut the mustard. Sorry, guys, but you're all wrong.",10
Not much to say...a powerful movie that you will never forget! Great story with a meaningful message and exceptional acting that deserves the highest rating.,3
"The Shawshank Redemption is quite simply the greatest film of all time. I completely agree with the other reviews in that this film is something of the soul and can honestly have a huge impact on you. If there's only one film that you watch in life I think Shawshank would have to be the one I recommend the most - despite not being my favourite film of all time I still think it is the best. Undoubtably a 10/10, a complete masterpiece.",7
"A few days ago, after a long time, I reviewed ""The Shawshank Redemption"", so I decided it was time to write my review. It may seem easy to review this film, defining it: beautiful or wonderful, but the truth is that they would not be quite exhaustive compliments. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is ""The Movie""; perfect from every point of view, the highest point that cinema can ever reach; raw, realistic, powerful, exciting! The plot is absolutely engaging and intriguing, keeping the viewer anxious until the end, making him experience unparalleled emotions, as if he were experiencing those of the characters themselves. The setting of the prison is masterly and completely immerses those who are watching the film. Not to mention the soundtrack, simply imposing. The presence of actors like: Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, puts the exclamation mark on this masterpiece allowing it to go down in history. So in conclusion I can not help but define this film as, perhaps, the best ever; and for those who had not yet looked at it ... Well, I think it's time to recover it, because you can't talk about cinema without having ever seen it. Greetings to all and see you at the next review.",10
"When someone asks you what´s your favorite song or color etc it is usually quite difficult to choose and you think of several favorites. You would think this complies to movies as well...but as soon as someone asks me what is my favorite movie, I answer instantly - The Shawshank Redemption.

This movie has been around for 24 years and it is still the highest rated movie on IMDB and for a good reason.

I guess for me these past 24 years I´ve had quite a lot of drama, horror, suspense, action, comedy etc going on in my life, but no matter at what age I watch this movie, it always-always speaks to me and brings out so many emotions. It´s just personal at this point, I couldn´t imagine not ever seeing it again.

I really don´t have to talk about the incredible storyline or amazing acting in this movie or even state that somehow they managed to make it just perfect. And the ending...oh well...it melts my heart everytime.",9
"Especially in this film. He can break your heart or make you laugh, and that's before he speaks. He will have you cheering at the end when ""Red"" gets in front of the parole board. I watched this only because someone told me it was great. It didn't look like a movie I'd like. Prison dramas aren't generally my thing. This one is different. The first half is brutal and at times difficult to watch, but it helps set the story in motion. You really feel you are there with Andy and Red. One of my favorite scenes is when the prisoners are on the roof of the prison drinking beer. You have to see it to understand what I mean. There isn't enough adjectives to describe this film I can only say that this one is definitely a must see. This one is right up there with ""Amadeus"" as my two favorite movies of all time. Please do not miss it.",10
"I looked on the IMDb list of the ""top 250."" This movie is number 1 on the list. That is way overrated. I can tell you that it was a good movie and deserves to be watched but it is not the best movie. Great acting makes this film enjoyable but the movie at times becomes boring and predictable. Good movie but not ""fantastic"" like many people seem to think. I enjoyed many other movies on the top 250 more than this film. If you want a great movie on the list check out The incredibles or the wrestler or toy story. They are better films in my opinion. Good movie but not fantastic like many people think. Way overrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10

"This is one of the great movies of the '90s. It's a moving stories of the friendship formed between two prisoners and really shows how that even in the darkness, we all need the light to get in through the cracks. It works as a story on a literal level, at face value. But it's also a beautiful metaphor for anyone who feels trapped in life. An inspiring soundtrack.",9
"Some truths not much but a few are accepted by nearly every people. You may not love Lord of the Rings, Star Wars,Braveheart, Love stories, Grease or any big movie but YOU LOVE THIS. LOOK in IMDb it is in the second place but look how many people voted, more than 120000 voted so this is the secret first movie. It stimulates your neurons, something changes inside you. White, black, yellow, American, European, African all people meet in some ways. THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE IS SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, everyone likes it -few exceptions. I sometimes think that we are all humans that are created in a way that we love this movie (or Darabont-director is not human so he made the movie for us to love it)Go talk to others ask about films then ASK ABOUT SHAWSHANK and see the change on their features then catch the smile of people when you talk about SHAWSHANK.Some truths not much but a few are accepted by nearly every people (beginning as finish) (finish as beginning)",10
"Having just re-watched this last night for the 3rd time, I remembered the entire movie within 2 mins, but as always, I was totally gripped.

Timeless classic, forever one of the best movies of all time.",10
"I have read so many raving reviews through the years, and only had the opportunity to watch it last night. It was not what I expected. I thought it would be on par with The Godfather in terms of quality. It's not. It's long, and that's the only commonality with The Godfather. It's far fetched, and predictable. And of course, it has that Stephen King fantasy feel to it (highly fictitious.) The characters are stereotypical. There is the sadistic captain, the self serving warden, the jail rapist...they're all here. One would expect this story to be realistic and serious. It's not. It quickly devolves into a fantasy.",9
"To everyone who is asking why this movie is this highly rated: the story, direction, the casting, everything is amazing. It is absolutely beautiful and tells a unique story. Adapted from Stephen King's novel (which I love), this movie tells you the struggles and lives of men in prison and their life after. I suggest everyone to watch it. :)",10
Superbly scripted and casted. Stands the test of time. A story based upon friendship perseverance and how one man defied the odds. Sometimes it's best not to read too much about a movie and just allow the story to sink in. You won't be disappointed is all I want to say.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that you shouldn't miss. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those niche films that only begins to shine after it has crept into your subconsciousness. Although it is a long film, you don't even notice the time passing as you become absorbed by the plot-line and twists therein. It's more than a good film - it's a great film!",10
As I said No words. Just watch it and enjoy the movie,9
"Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is no doubt a film we have all heard about at some point in our life from family relatives or close friends. Having heard about Morgan Freeman's stunning performance, I would even go as far as saying it might be his best performance in a feature film. The film focuses on Morgan Freeman's retelling of a story about a bond of two imprisoned men, finding hope when they could not believe into anything anymore.

The film is set in prison and therefore anyone watching should be prepared for some harsh scenes and animalistic behaviour that is expected from the 'cliché' prison inmates. The film tries to accomplish a unique feat, humanising the inmates and trying to make it out to the audience that everyone is human and always has a part of humanity in them. It shows it by breaking the characters will and leaving them in despair, only grasping for the last glimmer of hope that helps them survive in the disturbing prison situations.

Morgan Freeman's performance plays a substantial part in the whole film, surely presenting itself as one of his best narrated works, however it is the interaction between him and Tim Robbins that really stands out, the contrast between them is what makes the movie interesting to watch, which lead to me not pausing once during the whole movie. Despite showing us the world full of unfairness, cruelty and greed, it delivers a powerful message of kindness and hope, making you want to change something in your life after watching the film.

"I had heard so many good things about this movie, that I just had to see it. I was not disappointed. This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Period. Tim Robbins was outstanding, simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman was wonderful and I did not know that Gil Bellows had so much in him. This movie was absolutely breathtaking. The scenery, the realism, the characters, everything was simply outstanding. I sat through the entire movie, spellbound by the whole thing, and then I rewound it and watched again. I've seen 6 times since, and I always find new and wonderful things everytime I see it. I loved it. It was amazing. This movie is not just about prison, but it's about friendship. A 20-year-long friendship between two inmates. I recommend this movie for anyone who needs to find out what real friendship is all about. This is truly one of the best movies ever.",10
"Shawshank redemption is honestly one of Stephen King's best stories. Following the story of Andy Dufresne, a man charged with the murder of his wife is sent to Shawshank prison to carry out his life sentence. Andy defied any expectation of what a prisoner could or couldn't achieve and the power one could possess. With his inmate friend, Red, and his intelligence, Andy struggles to survive in prison with all his effort leading up to the grand finale. This movie is beautiful, it's brutal and emotional and it makes you question the American penitentiary system in the 1950's. But the point is that it's a heart warming story of two inmates, talking about hope, redemption and trying to figure out their next move. While there could only be one winner for the '94 Best Picture Awards, Shawshank deserved the title just as much as Forrest Gump so trust me when I say that you won't regret watching it.",9
"I saw it a long time ago. What impressed me was that an old man didn't know how to live after he was released from prison. Everything outside was unfamiliar to him. He couldn't work, communicate and live normally. Finally, I choose to end my life. Habit is really an extremely powerful and terrible power!",10
"This is a movie that a man should watch. How can it be? This is a movie that men and women should watch. One day in the future, I may come to review this classic with my son or daughter. Before the film is shown, I may say that this is the most beloved film in my life, which I will share with you today.",9
"There's nothing really to add to the 8644 other reviews. I've seen Shawshank at least 15 times. After 15 years I've just re-watched it again. It is timeless, still heart-breaking and uplifting at the same time, and still a very good reminder not to give hope up. And to like geology :)",10
"Wow, this film was really something! I'm glad I started to watch all the top films of imdb.com's ""All time Top 250 Movies"" list. Sure, The Godfather triology and Seven Samurai were great movies too, but they were way too long and I felt they rather gave me pain in the buttocks than a touch in my mind. This movie, on the other hand, has this distinguished feature; you don't want it to end. I haven't felt that way since I watched the Matrix at the cinema back in its old glory days (that goes for both the movie The Matrix and cinemas, they're out of date nowadays :)). It also made very clear to me that I never want to go to an american prison, just as little as I would like to go to a turkish prison...",10
"Just when one had thought no one can best outstanding movies like the Godfather along comes a movie like Shawshank, which simply blows the mind. It is a masterpiece of movie making and one which I never hesitate to watch - again and again.

As long as movies like this come along every once in a few years, I will always have faith in the movies",10
"If anything, The Shawshank Redemption is just a great film, you cannot even begin to disagree with that. It is well written and very believable. This is one of the few films in the history of American Cinema that needs to be as long as it has to be in order to tell the whole story to its audience. As we watch this film, it is almost as if we are watching a great artist create a new canvas giving it color, texture and varying hues. By the time we are through with the film, we can be assured that we have just sat through what is almost nearly an epic, in size, depth and length.

Morgan Freeman, the film's narrator, plays the role of Red with an almost patent sincerity that is hard to pull off most of the time. Tim Robbins' Andy Dusfrene is the film's ""pretty boy"", always looking on the bright side of anything, which when you are in a place that is as bleak as a prison can be quite tough. The two pull off a symbiotic relationship that far transcends the boundaries of the film itself. This is a ""buddy film"" but quite a different kind. Red and Andy play off each other well enough, and it is worth it just to watch the film for that reason alone.

The Shawshank Redemption was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Morgan Freeman was nominated as Best Actor, losing to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. It lost Best Adapted Screenplay to Forrest Gump. It lost Best Cinematography to Legends of the Fall. It lost Best Film Editing to Forrest Gump, lost Best Sound to Speed and lost Best Original Score to Disney's The Lion King. Of course, The Shawshank Redemption lost the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1994 to Paramount's juggernaut mega-hit Forrest Gump.

My rating: 3 and a half stars",10
"The development of the characters and story line are so intricately designed that you forget the this could be considered a ""period"" piece of sorts. The movie goer that likes authenticity along with the depth of drama ,will be pleased. The setting and cinematography for the time is on point and accurate. The relationships between the characters grow and have resolutions . Engaging the watcher to be inspired. Also, the carriage of the film over time lets you have an intimate experience with each character. The film score has a diversity of music genres and that will please many a generation, many a life lesson is conveyed thru the use of a stellar actor portraying the character flawlessly.",10
Robbins kills as does Freeman. Amazing supporting cast. Everything is flawless from the camera work to the editing. Some might say that the side stories and other occasional story slowdowns drain it a bit but in my opinion these elements really only serve to better the buildup for what is maybe the greatest ending of a film ever. The location the film was shot in is also perfect and really adds to just how fun this movie is to watch. I wouldn't dare to tempt anyone with spoilers but if you haven't seen this movie then you are really missing a huge moment. Not just in cinema history. But also in terms of appreciating life. And freedom.,10
No no fucin movie can be compared to this one. I'm out of mind man! The greteast movie ever undoubtedl!,10
"To partially repeat myself, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not the greatest film of all time. On the other hand, it isn't standard-brand Hollywood product either. Instead, like ""Casablanca"", ""Shawshank"" is Hollywood product raised to extraordinary levels through the mutual effort of craftspeople operating at peak levels. The acting, direction, camera work, editing, set design, and music all contribute, but none of these carry the film alone. The script, however, is the one indispensable element that the others rest upon, and it is the script upon which I want to concentrate. Not the plot, mind you--if you don't know already, it's a prison drama in which many terrible and wonderful things happen. Such stories can be told in many ways, but I especially admired the ways director/scripter Frank Darabont chose to convey Stephen King's original story.

Examples include patterns set up early in the film, such as the pro forma speech ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) gives each time he faces the parole board, or apparent throwaway details that come to unexpected life as the plot thickens. The pacing is excellent, keeping viewers interested over the film's length (well over 23 hours) by punctuating the story's progress not only with the incidents of brutal violence one expects from a prison film, but also moments of unexpected grace.

Finally, it's interesting to note that in the year ""Pulp Fiction"" received so much hoo-rah over the ways writer/director Quentin Tarantino played with the movie's internal time, Darabont got little credit for doing some of the same things in ""Shawshank"", such as depicting the same sequence of events from different viewpoints when approaching the film's climax. (Not that ""Pulp Fiction"" is less than brilliant, but ""Shawshank""'s approach to its own internal time was equally artful, if less flashy.)

The only things I could fault this film for are being manipulative, as well as more than a little predictable in the last 15 minutes or so. However, the previous 2 hours are so compelling, and set up so much emotional momentum, that it would take a titanic (if not ""Titanic"") sized object to drag the film down.

There's a great deal more to be said about the ways everyone involved--actors, set designers, musicians, etc.--does their part to bring ""Shawshank"" to life, but someone else will have to say it. Discover this treasure for yourself.",9
"This is a very thrilling movie that kept me spellbound. The acting is first rate. Morgan Freeman is superb and so is Tim Robbins. The reason why in my opinion it only deserves 8 out of 10 rather than 9 is that the story is not that great. Anyone who has seen his or her share of prison films will have come across all the standard ingredients: brutality by the staff, abuse by fellow prisoners, corruption at the top, we have seen it all before (cf. for example Brubaker). Despite these reservations, the acting, music and direction makes up for it. An evening well spent!",10
How could this redemption happen? By will and wit. The will to be free and the wit to get freedom.,10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is without a doubt one of the best films of the 90's and one of the best prison dramas of all time.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" can go head to head with any great movie of the 90's and probably win. The plot is airtight with only one or two mistakes through the whole film, not a lot of films could say the with even the likes of Forrest Gump, Titanic and Unforgiven have mistakes in them. One thing that Darabont does better than any director i've seen in a long time is pace every scene perfectly.

Another great thing about this film is the pitch perfect cast. Tim Robbins puts in the best performance of his career, even topping his role in ""The Player"" and Morgan Freeman is outstanding as ""Red"" Redding and old tymer who knows everything and has seen everything about jail. Bob Gunton is also brilliant as the evil sheriff putting in his best performance. But the most underrated performance in my opinion is the one put in by James Whitmore as ""Brooks"".

Eventhough ""The Shawshank Redemption"" may seem like a tear jerker or like a tragic drama by the end you will have a smile on your face . I won't ruin it for you but the ending is one of the best I have ever seen, only rivaled by the unexpected twist in ""The Usual Suspects"". So if you want to feel some emotion, be surprised and enlightened or just plainly watch a great movie rent ""The Shawshank Redemption"". 10/10 Near Perfect Movie",10
"After hearing all of the comments on this one, such as, ""Greatest Ever Made,"" ""I loved it,"" ""why didn't it win movie of the year?"" I had very high expectations upon seeing it.

I was not in the least disappointed. This movie IS all it's made up to be. Yes, without a doubt, you SHOULD see this movie.

The story is a thought-provoking one of hope, and how to find meaning in order in the apparent chaos of life. Andy escapes from the prison in an attempt to find himself, after his good friend Brooks, who has been released after decades of living in the prison, runs into bad fortune. Andy's other friend who is also released manages to find himself like Andy did through his help. This is a story of the torture humans inflict on one another and how it is escaped through hope.

10/10",9
"I saw this movie a long while ago, and I've seen it about 5 times, but if I catch it on TV, I sit back, relax, and watch it again, like if I have never seen it before.

Tim Robbins has become one of my favorite actors. After this movie and Arlington Road, I think he deserves as much as credit as an actor can get. Morgan Freeman is also known for making good movies, even when he has made some bad films, like every good actor alive, of course.

The idea of putting this two men together was simply brilliant. I also think the Director made a great job.

Now lets talk about the movie a little bit... I think this is the kind of movie that people wants, the kind of movie that makes you feel happy after you see it, the kind of movie that you cannot get out of your head for a few days after you've seen it. You also think, of course, that is so not fair that a person can lose 20 years of his life that way, being innocent, that the only witness, that can also save you, is murdered because the director of the Prison does not wants you to leave, since you are doing a very good job for him.

The way that Andy (Robbins) got rid of the three homosexuals that were abusing him, is excellent, and it also shows how Andy was not afraid of talking to the guards, and he was not nervous or anything like that, and most of all, that he was very smart. That was probably what I liked the most about the film, Andy's intelligence.

The way he escaped is just fantastic, specially because it could have been true, after all, he did not even kill anyone.

Maybe, when a person watches me talking like that, thinks that I only give credit to Robbins for the movie, but that is not true, I think Morgan Freeman did a very good performance too. After all, the movie would not be the same without the way he narrates it.

I'll rate this movie with a 10 out of 10, I think it really deserves it, and it's definitely one of the best movies ever.",9
Its the story of hope. beautiful i can just say this about the story this film really had a lot of lessons for your life just see it and enjoy,8
"I've seen this movie about a half-dozen times now, and it's slowly occurred to me that this is one of my two or three very favorite films. Each time I've seen it, I can appreciate different things about it, and the depth of the dialogue, and the meaning behind the events and characters takes on different symbolism and significance.

Having just read the story this was based on, I find it a rare example of where the film is better than the book. Not that the book isn't good, but there are some significant changes in the film that helped to make it such an endearing piece of work, and a more powerful experience than the original short story was. The development of the characters of the warden, and Brooks, for example, really fleshes out the story well.

The acting and direction is perfectly subtle and restrained, and though the feel may be a bit slow at times for some people, it gives a good sense of the feeling of time slowly dripping by in these people's lives.

What a shame that this was nominated for so many Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Actor (Morgan Freeman), and adapted screenplay, cinematography, music, etc., but didn't win anything. Granted, ""Forrest Gump"" is a great film, too, but it would have been nice if ""Shawshank"" had at least won something. Oh, well, that's not really important in the big picture, I suppose. The fact that this film is ranked #2 of all time here is very telling, and I'm sure it will be appreciated for a very long time to come... I know that every time it comes on TNT, I have to watch it again!",10
"There are too many comments on The Shawshank Redemption, and almost everything has been said ten million times. In order to avoid repetition, I will not say words like ""hope"" or ""freedom"". Of course, these are all very good, and they can also be felt from the movie the first time.

Well, let me talk about another word I have ever felt, ""rational"". Andy's victory is the victory of reason, and Andy's success is the success of reason. No matter what the situation is, whether it is good times or bad times, he remains calm, silently assessing the situation and doing what he can to achieve his goals.

This is a great talent!",9

"The first movie I watched on my mobile phone was more interesting than this, the first movie my friends suggested to me and I did very well.

Thank you.",10
"I never got the chance to see this when it was in the theaters. I bought this DVD when I saw it on sale at a music store, keeping in mind its place in the imdb top 250. Now that I have the DVD, I've seen it a number of times, each time not being my last.

As to whether this movie ""should have"" won the Oscar for best picture, my opinion is not firm on that. In many ways I really do wish TSR had won, but I do love both movies (Forrest Gump, and this one) each in their own right. They are two entirely different movies, each well done, and moving for their own reasons.

In ""The Shawshank Redemption"", Tim Robbins gives a breathtaking performance as Andy Dufresne, a man who is in the wrong place at the wrong time, leading to his wrongful conviction of the death of his wife and her lover. He gets two life sentences, back to back, to be served at the Shawshank prison.

It is there that he meets Red (Morgan Freeman), an inmate who has been at Shawshank for much longer and has establish status as ""a man who can get things"". Through his friendship with Red, and his experience as a banker, he gains the respect of the corrupt prison guards, and the other inmates, and manages to be rid of the abuse he was enduring at the hands of two ""sisters"". He also works very hard to build the best prison library in the country, and help illiterate men get their high school diploma.

My favorite scene is the one where everyone stopped what they were doing and stood transfixed as they listened to the beautiful sounds of a Mozart opera. It never fails to bring tears to my eyes. I also like the ""Beer on the Roof"" scene, but the Mozart segment is the one that will always be among my favorites.",10
"What would you do if you were convicted of murdering your wife and her lover, and sentenced to two life-imprisonment terms? Would you just give up? Would you try to escape? How long would you have to live in prison before you lose hope? Writer-Director Frank Darabont (The Mist, The Green Mile) explores these situations, and the themes of integrity, hope, and freedom.

Tim Robbins portrays the character of Andy Dufresne, the man who's situation was described earlier. Andy claims he didn't commit the murders, but strong evidence overruled his claims. Did Andy really not do it? We never really know for sure until later on in the film. When Andy first arrives at Shawshank prison, he's antisocial, and goes along with the prison's routine for months. After a few months, however, Andy starts developing a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a man who can get practically anything from outside the prison to inside, for a price. Andy asks him for a rock hammer. The importance of this rock hammer is evident later on in the film. But Andy's request for this rock hammer at the beginning of the film allows him to make a new friend at the prison to keep him company.

Andy's time at Shawshank prison causes it to change dramatically. Within a few years, Andy becomes an important aspect to the prison. His accounting skills help him receive benefits for himself and his friends by helping the prison guards with their taxes and other financial issues. The warden of Shawshank prison also takes interest in Andy, and soon uses him for a complex money scheme. Andy's role in the prison allows him to have a library established in the prison, as well as get beers and other things for his friends. Andy is basically making a new life for himself in the prison, but he still wants to get out. However, how many years does it take in the prison for him to give up? How many years does it take until the prison is your only way of life? This becomes a problem for many prison inmates, and even to a friend of Andy's.

One of the prisoners, Brookes (James Whitmore) is in this predicament. Brookes has lived in the prison for so long, for many decades, that it's all he knows. In the film Brookes gets released out of Shawshank prison, and is allowed to live a normal life; he has a job and a home. However, how does one live in a world that has drastically changed over the past decades? When Brookes was a little boy, cars were rare, but when he gets released from prison cars were everywhere. It's difficult to cope with, and Brookes is unable to deal with it. How long until Andy is the same way?

The film portrays two decades of Andy's sentence, with many different interesting story lines and conflicts mixed in, with many different characters. 'The Shawshank Redemption' has one important plot involving Andy's life in the prison and his hopes to escape, along with numerous side plots involving new inmates and such. The third act of the film is the quickest, and one of the most interesting parts. It involves a strong, yet completely unpredictable, resolution to the film. It also wraps up the lives of the main characters within the film in satisfying ways.

'The Shawshank Redemption' does an excellent job at portraying the themes of integrity and freedom, and how the prison can sometimes be some peoples' freedom, with the outside world being feared. Andy's integrity and hopes to escape from the prison is also a major part of the film. 'The Shawshank Redemption', adapted from the Stephen King novel, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', is a strongly-acted, well-written, and wonderfully-directed film. It's an amazing and inspirational piece of work, and probably the most perfect film I've ever seen. The plot is always at the same constant pace, and is never slowed down and boring. Every single part of the film is strong, entertaining, and thoughtful. It truly is a perfect film (this doesn't necessarily mean it's the the best film ever in the history of cinema).

PS: 'The Shawshank Redemption' came out around the same time as 'Forrest Gump' (1994). Both films are amazing and one of the best, but 'Shawshank' was overshadowed by the popularity of 'Gump.' But years later, 'Shawshank Redemption' was placed even higher than 'Forrest Gump' on AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies list. 'Shawshank' is also currently the #1 movie of all time on IMDb. Go figure.",10
"Sometimes the rarest of gems emerges from the most unlikely places, and in the most unlikely environments. Who might expect a sterling cinematic diamond in the rough set in a fictional Maine prison, and derived from a Stephen King short story?

Shawshank is a sweeping tale of friendship, hope, innocence, naivete, brutality, injustice, and vindication, wrapping you in the paradoxical warmth of the prison walls that surround the sympathetic characters who captivate our attention while telling their story.

The theme of Shawshank is well known; Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker, is wrongfully accused of murdering his wife after finding her in a compromising relationship with the golf pro of a local country club. The next 18 years of Andy's life depict the spectrum of the human experience, as we realize Andy's tale of prison life is an allegory for anyone whose life is constrained by imprisonment, whether socially corrective or mentally imposed.

The friendship between Red and Andy carries almost a religious air; in comes Dufrense preaching a gospel of hope to those very nearly deprived of it in their ""institutionalized"" setting. The danger of an alternate future, and the risks associated with exploring it, magnify the strength of the hope Andy conveys to his prison peers.

Andy's precision-strike vindication against the Warden at the film's conclusion makes his character the Superman to this gang of inmates, exposing the corruption and power-brokering that turned Shawshank from a correctional institution into a dismal penal colony.

This is not a sanitized representation of prison life; the worst kinds of behavior you might know of from prison legends are depicted here. And in the end, it makes you realize that perhaps hope is appreciated most in a place where it seems the least appropriate. If a prisoner can maintain hope in a prison cell, then surely we can, too.",9
"One of the greatest movies ever made, is one you can watch several times and still discover little magic in the script. Like that compass to know where north is in the treasure hunt. Unfortunately, mistakes happen, even for the number 1 rated movie. Repetition in min 42 and 25 when Andy wants to ask red for a special delivery.

Basically he uses the same line, and in real life, especially in a prison situation, that wouldn't have happened. ""I understand you're a man who can get things"" basically the same line Andy uses in both scenes and red responds also in the same way ... ""I'm known to locate certain things from time to time"" ...

Despite the mistake, it's difficult to see a movie like this one in cinema these days ...",9
"Shawshank Redemption is the best Movie i've ever seen, it does everything right, cinematography, story, characters, realism and the scope. This is a true masterpiece, no other film can possibly beat this. If it wasn't for this film, it wouldn't like myself anymore.

The story follows Andy Dufrense, a alcholic who gets framed for murder of his wife and get sent to prison, while in prison, he meets Red, a lovable prisoner who joins his years in prison to find a way a out of prison and along the way, help out the evil Warden Norton, while going through redemption and solace for Dufrense's Escape.

The film is beautifully written, With script so good, it makes every Movie-goer happy. The characters are intense and well-developed, they socialize in so many ways, like Brooks and Tommy, Brooks is a Liberian who has poor life, in the end committing suicide for his own will, and Tommy being a troubled Family man who must learn the alphabet to become better at vocabulary, but getting shot by one of the henchmen that Warden has. The acting is great, especially Morgan Freeman, he can't get any better. Tim Robbins is good as well, being more dramatic and personal than before.

The film is one of the most realistic prison films i've seen, the violence is shown in full view, sometimes off-screen and the Language is guaranteed, this is why this film is a adult Movie, sure sensitive kids can handle it, but it's so realistic, that's it's just too much to handle.

Shawshank Redemption is the best Movie i've seen...period, no other film can bring that much realism and drama than this masterpiece, it's just beautiful, this is absolutely a must watch, should not be overlooked, despite being a huge Box Office flop, it's fantastic and possibly the best since Godfather.

"""The Shawshank Redemption"" Directed by and written by the fantastic Frank Darabont and this is his first of two adaptation of Stephen King novels he has done.

Shawshank follows Tim Robbins, Andy Dufresne as he is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to serve a double life in prison where he meets Red, played by Morgan Freeman and the movie follows Andy as he makes a big change on Shawshank prison through the years he is staying there and the impact of the various characters make on him and his different viewpoint and symbolic changes he has on his life.

In my perspective Shawshank is perfect. It's beautiful narration done by Freeman brings warmth and some great lines of comedy to the screen with the unbelievable performances done by this A list cast and crew. There is not a single scene in this film that I would want to remove, alter, or change to make it better than it is now. And that's from the unbelievable directing power of Darabont. With the attention to detail and this movie being an improvement of King's short he wrote for it. It proves that on a rare case that a movie can be better than the book or in this case the story.

There honestly isn't much to say about the writing of this film minus it's flawless. Every line, every word, every sound that is made by the cast is perfect and plays into the finishing act of the film with the huge reveal given.

The acting is suburb with even the minor characters being some of the most memorable ones as well. One of the best supporting characters is the library caretaker, Brooks Hatlen who is an older man who doesn't want no harm and wants to just tend to his library and bring education and fun to this dark and depressing prison. And then of course Bob Gunton as Warden and William Sadler as Heywood are some of the greatest antagonists to ever exist in a King adaptation.

The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect film and one that is still talked about decades later and will never be forgotten as well.

The Shawshank Redemption gets a 10/10",10
This film paved the way for prison films and series of a similar style. The acting was beautifully done. A bit too long- my only gripe,9
"This movie is definitely on my best of the decade list. It borrows heavily from a couple movies and makes a fresh, dramatic approach to story telling. Excellent directing, writing, and acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are awesome in this film. This is film-making at its best. I own the VHS and DVD versions of this film, and I highly recommend this film to everyone.",10
"I never expected to have a movie about prison be among my ten favorite movies of all time, but The Shawshank Redemption stands in that category. This, however, is no ordinary prison movie. It is a movie that cuts to the core of the human psyche and exposes the ideas of hope, strength, and survival all within the character of Andy Dufresne.

I recently finished reading the short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Remption"" on which this movie is based. While the story is a great one and Stephen King is an exceptionally talented writer, I believe that this film manages to take a small morsel of a story and stretch its meaning and characters out into a fully engrossing film that will reach the viewer on all levels. Tim Robbins does an excellent job as the complex Andy Dufresne and shows the range of emotions that Andy comes to feel during his sentence within his actions and expressions. While the character of Red is a white Irishman in the story, the movie chooses to make him black and cast Morgan Freeman. This was a wise choice and Freeman brings his immense talent to the character on screen, displaying Red's cunning nature and raw emotion. All of the other major characters are given more life in the movie than the book, and work well together to create the prison atmosphere of Shawshank. While reading the book, I kept expecting to read about one of my favorite scenes in the movie, where Andy locks the warden's office door and plays the uplifting opera music for all of the inmates. This is an excellent addition that made the movie even more effective. The twist ending where Andy gives the warden his ""just desserts"" in the movie is more satisfying than when it is omitted in the book.

So there are people out there who call this movie overrated. Maybe it is. It does tend to pull at your emotions in various ways throughout its runtime. And it manages to touch many different sensitive issues that people hold dear. But it has such a strong message and so many effective scenes that you can't help but enjoy it. This movie made me, a naive high school student upon my first viewing, take a deeper look at life, the impact of hope, and the effects of prison. Forrest Gump is an excellent movie, but I don't understand why the Academy chose to reward it instead of The Shawshank Redemption.

Call it overrated if you like, but it's still one of my favorites.

"This would have to be THE best movie that I have ever seen. The story of a wrongly convicted man. And the story of a man searching for meaning. And the story of an institutionalised man. This movie takes several different stories and turns them into one fantastic film.

Watch it a number of times to see all the stories come together in an inspiring manner that touches the soul. I can't recommend this movie enough. Morgan Freeman's performance of the narrating Red, and explanations of prison life are truly touching. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy is near perfect, no, it IS perfect.

Watch it, then watch it again.

You won't be disappointed.",10
Dont think this movie did its best few mistakes but still recommend it for interests.,10
"There are exceedingly few films that leave such strong impressions upon you, and even fewer that leave such impressions that have a meaning and a purpose. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a message about hope. What better way to show its value than through a film about a man spending 19 abusive and miserable years in prison for a horrendous crime he didn't commit, and finally getting his freedom along with supreme revenge against those who mistreated him.

Films where virtually everything that takes place contributes to the story are also rare. Everything in ""Shawshank Redemption"" had meaning; Andy earning beer for his fellow inmates, his two weeks ""in the hole"" for playing music over the loudspeaker, and Brooks' realization that he couldn't survive on the outside are just few examples. Throughout the movie, Andy's best friend Red maintained his sense of defeat, succumbing to the fact that he too was becoming ""institutionalized"" as Brooks had been, while Andy, in his subtle ways, viewed everything in his life as an opportunity.....including a tiny rock hammer that could bring him freedom ""in 400 years"".....or less! The movie builds up the two opponents, hope vs. despair, for their final battle in the end. After more than two hours of watching an innocent man suffer, I never expected to smile so much for the outcome of such a film.

On a more technical note, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a filming masterpiece. The actor selection was perfect, the acting was impeccable, and the directing of it all supported the story with absolute precision.

Anyone who dislikes this film ought to be shunned from society.",4
"It's fair to say that it's worth visiting several times; every time you repeat this film, you will see new concepts in front of you. This movie is full of existential concepts. At the same time, you can be free! Hope is the most important message of this film.",10
I like the movie very much. It's great.I would recommend this movie to my friends.,10
"It is really classic, everyone has a desire for different freedom in their hearts, but they have to be bound by the real life, very contradictory individuals, I hope everyone can find true freedom like Andy.I love Morgan freeman",10
"In the far western reaches of south west Wales I was lucky to be born to a father who had immaculate taste in film. At the tender age of 14, when I started to understand the complexity of human emotion I was introduced to this beautiful film. I remember the first time I sat and viewed the film, my father put the VHS in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film, from the age of 14 I reckon I must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time I still think this is probably the best film I have ever seen.

Just thought I'd express a little of how I feel about this film, hope you don't mind.

"An excellent tale about enduring incredibly adversity and eventually triumphing. The incomparable Morgan Freeman sets the tone as narrator. This should not be seen as a ""prison"" movie, even though it is set in a prison. Tim Robbins, as the other major character and the man whose trials rival those of Job, is a good everyman. When this film was nominated for a lot of Oscars, Kathie Lee Gifford made a great show of ridiculing its title (on ""Live with Regis and...""). She hadn't seen the movie and would probably be embarrassed to be reminded of the episode.",10

"Yeah I agree this is not a bad film. Its got a story that sucks you right in and it plays its hand very well but it really doesn't stand up too closely to scrutiny in my humble opinion. The plot is rather riddled with holes (do you really mean to tell me that after all those years in prison and the searches the prison guards never found a tunnel behind the picture....Puhleeease... How stupid are we meant to think those prison guards are)and it really is just a well-made feelgood movie. Look, I enjoyed the movie but after reading many of the comments on this website it sounded like it was directed by God Almighty and starred his only-begotten son. A bit of critical judgement please.",7
"This movie is uplifting and it is amazing and there are so many adjectives I could use to describe it so I won't waste your time...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and the story is amazing, considering that I'm not a fan of King's works...I rated this a 10/10 for that wonderful film...",10
"Some of the comments on this forum have described this film in parts as being unrealistic and simplified but to me this film represents a purity and a brilliance in film making that is very uncommon. What were those people at the Oscars thinking when they passed up Morgan Freeman for best actor? He was quite simply superb....his character is so believable, so warm and compassionate, if ever a convicted murderer displayed his traits of reason and forgiveness it'd be a crime to keep him behind the sterile, evil walls of somewhere like Shawshank. Robbins also plays his role in quiet perfection as the thoughtful city banker wrongly imprisoned for murder. I think the man deserves his comparisons with Orson Welles.....what an actor. We see both brutality and humanity in the prison guards and some lighter moments when they all begin to realise they can profit from Dufrane's financial wizardry though of course the forced and immoral contract with Dufrane in enriching the sadistic Capt. Hadley and Warden Norton always lurks in the mind......the potential for violence and betrayal never far from our minds. If US prisons were like this, I feel genuine pity for the inmates, no matter what their crimes.

I thought the imagery and cinematography, as well as the stirring soundtrack to be other remarkable features. From the Maine flag fluttering in the breeze as the camera sweeps over the prison....to the inmates listening to the Marriage of Figaro and finally to Red's walk through those sun drenched fields in search of Andy Dufrane's promise under that great Oak tree. In one word, inspiring.

The ability of this picture to move has been vividly described in many past comments and the script in itself is like some beautiful songbird that flew into Hollywood and brought the the notion of quality to new levels. It's not that it is complicated, it is a simple story but that's where its genius lies I believe, that's why most rank it amongst the greatest movies ever made. Robbins' descriptions of the Pacific beach he one day hopes to be on, his heroic attempts to bring these wretched and brutalised prisoners a taste of freedom and normality actually carries them beyond those ideals and on to a higher plain almost. He gives them (if only for a short time) an inner peace which transports them beyond those prison walls. Though we never forget that the great majority of them are there because they committed violent crime, the irony of it, as Robbins says himself, is that he had to come to prison to become a crook. This seems to be the case when men and women are incarcerated for long periods. Robbins' hope is of course one of the major themes of the film and I found that you can, in a strange way, transport this to your own life, to your current problems and fears and that is the genius of films like this, it liberates the viewer as well, makes you think.",10
A1 storyline. A1 scripting. A1 casting. A1 directing. A1 cinematography A1 costume. A1 locations. How can you beat this?,9
"This film brilliantly encapsulates great abstract themes like hope, freedom, salvation and meaning, in the form of a compelling and dramatic story. Like life itself, it somehow moves slowly and quickly all at once.

Another great theme is friendship. Freed from the distraction of a ""love interest"" angle on account of its prison setting, the story explores the love of friendship without ever placing that love into competition.

The brutality and cynicism of the prison form a backdrop against which elements of tenderness and enlightenment carry ever more poignance. Life is not always pretty and easy.

Great music, art, literature, and even friendship have a mystical, elevating beauty that we cannot always articulate; yet it entrances us like the prisoners standing spellbound as the PA - a dreary symbol of command and routine - suddenly announces a soaring Mozart aria. As Andy says, there are some things that no one can ever take from us.

The use of symbolic imagery is masterful. The prison, the hole (solitary), and especially some scenery towards the finale are truly proof that a picture can be worth a thousand words. If you look closely, you can find evocative symbolism in virtually every scene.

Likewise, the film is exceptional in its use of time and space. The same place can carry different meanings for different people - the scribbles in the halfway house, the majestic oak tree in the field. The same is true of objects - the Bible, the hidden vault, the revolver and bullets. The complex message may be something like the idea that although places and objects can constrain and capture, salvation lies first within us and between us.

Between the deep messages, the story sustains a good amount of intrigue and drama, and even some levity (see Alexandre Dumas).

Finally, there seems to be some brilliant misdirection on the character front. Morgan Freeman's character Red largely narrates Andy's story, and we could be forgiven for viewing Andy as the lead character given the attention to his heroic deeds. Red is more of an observer, and the story doesn't do much to follow the details of his contraband trade, or his background for that matter. And yet in the final analysis it is really Red whose character is at stake, who must find a transformation.

Don't we mostly go through life as observers? Circumstances and our past selves may lead us in better or worse directions. It may seem that we are a product of a cold and uncaring system, easily controlled and quickly forgotten. Yet when we look inside, when we are honest with ourselves and others, when we open ourselves up to our friends, when we allow ourselves to be inspired, when we heed the call of adventure - that is when we can go forth into the world, free, redeemed.",10
One of the best movies ever made. That title gets thrown a lot but this movie truly deserves it.,9
"Hope is a good thing, and maybe the best thing of all. I love this movie.",8
Everything about the movie is perfect. its one of the movie that you have to see in your life.,10
"Will Andy be reshaped and changed for losing his freedom? In fact, the good and evil in people's hearts are not increased or decreased because of the loss of time and the change of environment.",7
"Never lose hope, because it's around you all the time. Even when you feel desperate. Hope will find you and encourage you to keep on living. I love that ""warm place with no memory"". ""Get busy living or get busy dying."" ""Rehabilitated? I don't have any idea what that means. To me it's just a made-up word, a politician's word."" ""Remember hope is a good thing.""",10
The emotion and setting makes you feel at home. The prison has various cheapy characters we get to learn about. Very realistic in showing prisoners before and after life. Some great emotions. On the way a lot of deaths. But the climax being a happy ending felt good. Some action sequences blended but not the plus point. Being a prison film they should've added more action in my opinion. One thing I Would say is the acting which was pretty fab. The main characters in were the core of the movie it was their bonding which brings the audience in interest. Lastly a good movie probably one of the best prison classics!,10
"Having read the King novella, i was very anxious to see this movie, and when i did, i was pleasantly surprised. It was pretty faithful to the novel, and the casting, score and direction were superb. Then i saw 'Escape from Alcatraz'. Now, i am one of Mr. King's biggest fans; i have all of his novels and would be the first to defend him as a brilliant author. But....well, i can't really go much farther without thinking of the word 'plagiarism'. Now, i know that may be a trifle strong, but when i actually started to think about all the similarities between these two movies, i'm sure you will agree it is suspicious to say the least. 1. In Shawshank, Andy hides his rock-hammer inside the Bible. In Alcatraz, Morris hides his nail file inside the Bible. 2. In Shawshank, Brooks rescues and feeds a blackbird which he feeds at the table. In Alcatraz, Litmus rescues and feeds a mouse which he feeds at the table. 3. In Shawshank, Andy escapes by tunneling through his wall with said tool. In Alcatraz, Morris escapes by the same method. 4. In Shawshank, Andy releases the dirt from his cell excavation by dropping it down his trouser legs. In Alcatraz, Morris does the same thing. 5. In Shawshank, the prison warden is a corrupt individual who takes a disliking to the central character. In Alcatraz, the warden also takes a disliking to Morris in much the same way. 6. Both in Shawshank and in Alcatraz, Morris and Andy both take jobs in the prison library, distributing books to the inmates. 7. The character of Red in Shawshank is almost an exact copy of the character of English in Alcatraz. 8. The character of Brooks in Shawshank is very much the same role fulfilled by Litmus in Alcatraz, and both die in the movie. 9. In both movies, the cenral character has to defend himself against the gay inmates, and has several altercations with them (Wolf in Alcatraz, and the 'Sisters' in Shawshank). The prison shower scene is an almost exact copy of the scene in Alcatraz. 10. Instead of painting (used as a metaphor for freedom and hope in Alcatraz), Shawshank uses music to symbolize Andy's undying hope. In fact, the speech given by Andy about ""they can't take the music away from me"" almost echoes that of Doc in Alcatraz, who says something very similar about his paintings.

I now find it hard not to think of Shawshank as a re-make of ""Escape from Alcatraz"". However, both movies are well worth watching in their own right, but i have never felt the same about Shawshank after seeing Alcatraz, and knowing that it was made almost 20 years before Shawshank was even written. Anyway, a very good movie none the less.",9
"This film is probably one of if not the best sleeper hits in film history. Of all the votes cast on IMDb, I bet less than 1% saw the film at the cinema. Like all sleeper hits, under-hyped at the time of release, when you watch it and revel in its brilliance, your hair standing on end in parts, it feels more personal to you than a massive blockbuster. I think this is why it is so over-rated. it is not a ten. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are so fantastic and the story is so emotionally wrought that it is possible to get carried away. But better than the Godfather? Gimme a break!!! We are comparing the work of a superb craftsman with the work of a visionary artist whose films have had more influence on modern cinema than anyone bar perhaps his old film-school mates. A fantastic, hugely-credible tearjerker. By the DVD, get it out now and again, get yer tissues ready.",1
"Truly a masterpiece. This is one of those movies which you can watch over and over again and still find it as moving as the first time you watched it. This film can not be replicated, because the film is special; the Director wanted to make a piece of art of his film. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you never been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live). For this I give this movie a 10/10 and strongly recommend you to see it.",9
This is one of King's best movies. It's about a guy who is accused of killing his wife and is sent to prison. He meets a man named Red in prison who he sort of inspires to do more with his life. Near the end something happens that you would never expect and is very interesting. This is a great movie and the director did a great job in showing Stephen King's book and not wrecking it.,10
"I learned and loved from the story. This is my first time loving an actor based on their stories and how they developed scene by scene it makes me one to reminiscence again and again. Full with a lot of good tears and comedy, this movie deserved to be #1 movie in its era.",10
"Without doubt, this is my favorite film of all time.

Every time I watch this film I feel like its the first time. Its just fantastic.The heart of the film is the performances; Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both terrific in their roles and the chemistry between them is so genuine it wouldn't surprise me if they were friends before making the film. It also has the best use of Morgan Freeman's narration voice, I almost felt like someone was in there telling the story to me. Bob Gunton was great as well as the rest of the supporting cast.

Overall, I'm just in love with the story, I love films that involve someone being faced with a bad situation and are able to turn their life around. In my opinion, this is the best use of that method of film making.

Shawshank Redemption is a great film, my favorite in fact and I would recommend it to anyone.",10
"With so many awards and commends, I think I don't have to say more. In IMDb, it always the top1 or 2 in the list. This movie always is the top 1 in many people. This touching movie is always mentioned on BBS board again and again. Without fancy special effects and visual effects, without good-looking super stars, without amazing filming tricks, this movie (the story) is extraordinary. It is touching, and gives all people hope. It gives me dreams. Especially at the end of this beautiful film, when friendship comes, when dreams come true, and when the light of human's soul is lightened up. This film gives people hope. I think everyone seeing this movie has been moved. The two main actors Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have excellent acting, and the director Frank Darabont -- he is truly amazing. It is always hard to adapt one short story into a film. However, the director've done such an amazing thing. The film is so attractive and the script is perfect. I like the way he uses narration to tell a story. One thing I felt disappointed is for Academy Award in 1995. I think it is really the most difficult year for all the members to select for the best picture and the best director. I love Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption. Both of them are excellent. If they are in different year, Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly deserves ""the best picture"" and ""the best director"". I wanna give this film eleven out of ten (I do love this movie!) This film with no doubt that it is the top3 important movie in film history! If you like movies, and you have no chance to see it, go see it!

One of the most important films in history.",10
"This ain't ""The Electric Company."" Although all of the performances in this film are masterful (showing by turns both the depravity and the humanity of the prison experience) Morgan Freeman's role as ""Red"" is truly the centerpiece of this film - so good it defies description. All I can say is that of all the movies I own on DVD, this is one of my proudest purchases; a film I can play that not only shows off how good digital quality looks but that shows off how an excellent screenplay and great actors can come together to make a cinematic masterpiece.",10
"One of my favourite films ever. I first saw the movie shortly after it came out, I was around 16 years old. I like to revisit it every year or so and it's still as fresh as ever. Although there are some unpleasant realities and strong language, for once I think they are justified and not overly emphasised.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb. You would think a film set mostly in a prison would be depressing, boring even. Not so. I always feel uplifted after watching it and the final scene never fails to bring a tear to my eye. I like it so much I bought two copies on DVD in case I lose one. This should be on everyone's ""must see"" list.",10
"Together with ""Papillon"", The Shawshank Redemption is the best prison movie ever. It is of the kind that makes a print in memory. There are many stories within one story without disturbing the unity: a perfect stream. The story unfolds in many ways. The stories of the lost souls of modern system..

Dufrane's innocence and neverfading hope, Red's friendship and wisdom, and other characters: all of them are equally important. Watch it several times, you'll find something interesting each time.

You'll think where is the prison: inside or outside? The modern system is such overwhelming, Dufrane cannot escape it even in jail. He has to pay the price of his innocence in such a world. But he decodes the system and prepares his individual salvation to go to the ocean which has no memory. Red is another story: he seems to sink into a total submission and a silent resignation till he sees the neverfading hope of Dufrane. The part where Dufrane plays an Italian song to all locking the door is perfect. And that big tree where Red goes to pick up the money and note Dufrane left: it is unforgettable.",9
"This film is destined to become a classic. It shows the human spirit in full force. The story is terrific with many wonderful characters. Morgan Freeman delivers a truly brilliant performance that received a well-deserved Academy Award nomination. Bob Gunton gives a wonderfully villainous, intense performance as Warden Norton. Darabont's direction is solid. The climax is wonderfully uplifting. On a personal note, I thought this film slowed down at times but these sequences were essential to the plot, they just seemed to distract me. This film is definetly worth a look.",10
"It's certainly not better than The Godfather.

The characters in this movie are likable and the story is good. The music is also quite good but nothing else anything that stands out to me. The movie is a bit slow in some places. And i find quite some bits of this movie not particularly entertaining.

In conclusion: a good movie and it deserves to be in the top 250 but not above The Godfather and certainly not number 1",7
One of the most greatest movie of all time. A MASTERPIECE. A PRECIOUS GEM. A block of gold. A treasure chest of coins. Anyone who doesn't like this movie has some serious mental problems. Anyone who doesn't have tears has some feeling problems. Its truly shocking to see that this movie didn't get any oscars forest gump didn't deserve it.,10
This movie is more than entertaining .. In some ways it is aspirational and give us the actual meaning of hope.,9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless masterpiece about hope, friendship, and the human spirit. The film features outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and breathtaking cinematography that captures the harsh reality of prison life. This classic is a must-watch for all movie lovers.

A film that defies easy classification. It's a drama, a comedy, and a tale of redemption all rolled into one. Released in 1994, the film was directed by Frank Darabont and based on a novella by Stephen King.

The film's cinematography is also noteworthy, with Roger Deakins' expert use of light and shadow capturing the stark beauty of the prison environment. The film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, is haunting and melancholy, perfectly complementing the tone of the film.",10
"Along with The Green Mile, another excellent Frank Darabont adaptation of a Stephen King story, Shawshank is a masterful and thought provoking film.

Everyone in Shawshank is innocent you see - except Red (Morgan Freeman). The casting for this film, like Green Mile, is nigh on perfect and helps to create a fully believable tale about one man's fight to prove his innocence against a system that doesn't even care.

Morgan Freeman is masterful in his role as Red, one of his best ever, and despite originally intended to be an Irishman (you would expect Caucasian) is brilliant. See Driving Miss Daisy to re-affirm his acting skills.

Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne, is excellently cast in the role of an innocent man, a successful banker, jailed for two life terms (in 1948) for the murder of his wife and her lover. Being innocent doesn't count and Andy is locked up in the hell-hole Shawshank prison. But his innocence is a driving force. Like a bird - Andy wants to be free.

To say the sets are impressive is a major understatement. While the exterior shots are of a renovated Gothic prison, the interiors are nearly entirely built on a sound-stage. The production design is top-notch. You never want to go to a prison like Shawshank.

The Warden (Bob Gunton) is a real peace of work - a corrupt official hiding behind The Bible. Clancy Brown (Captain Hadley) is a nice bloke in real life - you would not think it for he is very sinister in this role.

Veteran actor James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen delivers one of his finest performance in his long career - ""institunalised"" after spending most of his life behind bars - 50 at Shawshank. The world all these years later is a shock to Brooks that has sad, no tragic, consequences.

Overall this rather long film reeks of quality. Great cast, story, acting, production design, direction.

Highly recommended - must see really - and one of my favourite ""serious"" films of all time. After I finish this I will put The Green Mile on to make the evening perfect.

Rating: 10/10",10
"One of THE best movies ever made, never get tired of it. The themes of hope, friendship, and faith have never been so well presented on film.",10
This movie is a masterpiece in terms of cinematography and direction during that time. The movie provides a lot of message that is easily digestible by all level of the community.,7
"Is The Shawshank Redemption the second best movie of all time? No, it isn't. However, I contributed to its ranking by giving it a 10/10 vote. Yes, IMDB's Top 250 list is flawed in the sense that some of the greatest films ever made inspire some of the most violently negative reactions in a sizable contingent of the collective movie-viewing public (thereby rendering them ineligible for the highest overall voting average). The Shawshank Redemption, however, clearly did not evoke many negative reactions- should the film be faulted for that?

Absolutely not, I say. This is a grand movie that strikes one fundamentally real and basic existential chord, namely the abstraction of faith and hope within the context of the tremendous pain and frustration humanity inflicts upon itself. Faith does not have to be of a religious nature, and The Shawshank Redemption doesn't go there (this is why I love it, but abhor The Green Mile). Rather, the faith of Shawshank is a stubborn, earthly, human faith, that despite the arbitrary injustice of existence, the individual can persevere and affirm within himself or herself that yes, life is worth living. For my money, that is solid return on two hours of my time.

I am a cynic and a misanthrope, supremely so on both counts. That said, I acknowledge that I have no choice but to accept the context of my existence for what it is, and I can either ""get busy living or get busy dying."" Apparently, most people agree on some level.",10
"I saw this movie for the first time a year and a half ago. I liked it, but I didn't remember how much until it was on TV today. Everything comes together so well at the end, and on repeated viewing, there is a whole new level to it.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both exceptional in their roles. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a convicted murderer who goes to Shawshank Prison where he is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), who has already served 20 years there. Despite the hardships of prison, Andy refuses to lose hope, and he tries to inspire Red to feel as he does.

I can't think of one scene that was wasted. Everything helped build to the movie's conclusion. Every character was important, as was every line of dialogue.

I actually cried at the end. This movie really makes you think and touches your heart. Next to Pulp Fiction, the best movie of the 90's.",10
"In my opinion, this is the perfect movie. Perfect characters that are fleshed out flawlessly. The story sounds cliche but it is done perfectly.

Final Score: A+",10
"as i was saying in the title this is way overrated...i can't believe they called it a psychological movie, and i think it's a copy of all escape movies in history. i mean yes, the acting is good, it has some good lines, but nothing more...it is a very normal good movie...just that",9
"The central idea is hope, freedom, and institutionalization. Rita Hayworth is so beautiful.",8
"Not much more can be said that already has been said about how truely a good movie shawshank is. Morgan freeman really elevates the film to almost masterpiece status with his characters insight and voice. The movie can in many ways, be seen as an allegory of never giving up for a better future even with horrible circumstances that come in life. An absolute must see!",7
"What can I say about Shawshank Redemption this movie has everything you possibly can in a movie like great writting,great acting,and great directing.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give thier best performance of thier life in this great movie.Frank Darabont does a great job with the writting and Directing.I'm surprised this movie didn't win any oscars.Who cares this movie is still the greatest thing to ever hit the theater.This movie is going to be remember forever.This is truly a great movie in every category.A classic to always remember.",10
"If you haven't watched Shawshank Redemption ,you have missed the best movie of all times.",10
This movie is of great philosophical dept. A movie full of realisations.,10
"The characters, the plot, their friendship...just beautiful. I loved everything about this movie. I've never seen such a brilliant movie in my life. It' 2022 and I'm a bit late but I'm definitely going to rewatch it one day.",8
"I consider this film superior to Forrest Gump (the big oscar winner that year) in almost every way possible. Granted, Forrest Gump is a good film, but The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely brilliant piece of art (yes I said art) that, in my opinion, is one of the greatest films ever made. Judging from the scores it got here on the IMDB, many people agreed with me.

This just prooves how ego-centric the Oscars actually are. They really aren't about which film is the best, they're about what the simple-minded audience wants to win. Forrest Gump made an absolute killing at the box office, Shawshank did quite poorly. It's likely that the results at the Oscars satisfied more people than it would have had Shawshank won, but that's only because not many people saw it. I'd like to see you find someone who hasn't seen Forrest Gump.

If you think this is a one time thing for the Oscars, look at the results for Titanic, a film that I thought was absolute trash, James Cameron's worst. It won a bunch of oscars because everyone on the planet saw it. LA Confidential was the FAR more deserving film of that year, Good Will Hunting was also very good. But since the academy wouldn't want to upset all the idiotic fans of Titanic, it takes the oscars over the deserving film. The only ""NOMINATION"" that lousy movie deserved was for visual effects and I thought Starship Troopers deserved the win (which it didn't get, of course).

I think it's really sad that our society has become so corrupted by mass hysteria that it can't even figure out which films are great, and which aren't. Forrest Gump is good, The Shawshank Redemption is great. Titanic is crap, LA Confidential is very good (not as good as Shawshank though).",10
"One of the best films ever made. I thought it was very spiritual, in the sense that I learned a very powerful lesson that has helped me in my daily living. Never give up hope. Acting is superb, directing is great, story is wonderful. Highest recommendation.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption was a film that I was always on my way to the theater to see, but unfortunately, I got sidetracked each and every time. Critics felt that the long title kept people away, I guess I was in that category, no matter how great I heard this movie was. I finally saw the movie the day it hit videotape. To this day, it continues to dominate the number one position on my list of favorite films of all time. There is so much to love about this film. Especially the writing by Frank Darabont. This is one of the few films that does Stephen King's material justice. It's a very uplifting story, one that you can't really articulate with words. This film is about the experience. I'm proud to say that I own a copy of the movie, a copy of the screenplay, and a copy of Different Seasons, in which the original story derived. This is the one picture I recommend to people, even strangers, on a regular basis.",9
"This is what movies are truly made for. This is movie making as an art form. This movie deeply conveys more human insight than I thought possible in something so short and simple as a film. It deals with sin, love, friendship, fear, greed, persistence, frailty, hope, courage, cruelty and a whole array of other human traits, and it deals with all of them in an amazingly complex and full manner. This is a prime example of a creation that allows us to understand another's soul. It does this through words, sounds, facial expressions, in short, everything that a movie can offer us in condensed form that we often don't pay attention to in life. We have to pay attention here. We can't look away. If you can come out of this movie without finding something out about yourself you haven't really experienced it, perhaps you've just watched it. I give very few movies a 10, because nothing man made can ever really be perfect, but some things come close. This is one.",10
A film that will motivate you in every situation......,9
"Shawshenk Redemption is truly on a level of its own. Fantastic plot, writing etc. The ending is probably the most baddass ending in a movie ever. What I really love about the movie is its incredibly realistic portrayal of evil and the harsher realities of life. The movie feels 5 hours long, but by the end you wish it were 10 hours. Extraordinary acting by Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton and the rest of the cast. However, I only gave it a 9 because there is always room for improvement.",10
It doesn't matter what kind of genre or style of film you prefer. Shawshank Redemption wvas made to be enjoyed by everyone.,10
"If someone says can patience be great??.to ans this they need to watch this.awesome screenplay,direction and the performance was minf blowing",10
This film is one of the best in the movie history.,10
Yes...just an amazing movie it is...one of the best movie,8
I'm not usually one to enjoy these kinds of movies. I typically like to go for a sci-fi or a horror movie. I watched this with my mom and it was amazing. The acting is stupendous and the storytelling really transports you right into the story. They did such a nice job of even identifying the problem with institutionalism and expressing it through the prisoners. I actually live near the prison this was shot in and think I may be taking a tour there now. (The prison is closed down and haunted so you can go and actually tour it),10
"This movie is just so beautifully sincere.

What's so special about this film that I love is how its so much about friendship. Unlike most movies that focus on romances more, a lot of them which can be really tack on.

This movie relationship with Red and Andy is just too beautiful really shows how much humanity people in prison really do have.

You know Tim Robbins of this film really said it best about what makes this film so heartfelt of how we all in some way feel trapped in our own lives.

Truer words have never been spoken. That 100% shows everyone in this film and in ourselves.

10/10 Just a incredibly endearing film.",10
"How precious is a person's life? Is putting away people for ungodly amounts of time for a mistake the right way to dabble with the issue of the threat they pose?

I know little about incarceration and such issues but am pulled to think there's a better way than tossing in the trash the ONE life people have, indulging in our negligence to better them, regardless of the crime (though there's clearly harsh outliers), it's definietly a complex issue.

We're shown a heartbreaking scene of a kind of hell we humans have agreed upon. Decade after decade of rejections for freedom just strike a chord in me, I think of how mistaken I was about something I did some time ago and how I've changed as a person in a reasonably short amount of time and to extrapolate that situacion to someone facing long prision time is just soul crushing.

That's the feeling that gripped me through my first watch, the horror of having time dillute within those walls as your youth and potential fade away. Hopefully hummanity moves towards a state where true rehabilitation is achievable within no more than a couple years, with the right tools, psychoterapy, love and understanding I don't think it's too delusional of an idea, for a good part of those who've lost their freedom anyways.

Nonetheless, the ability of the characters to navigate the horrible hand they've been dealt and to find meaning through friendship and hope is envigorating, forced to look at the long road ahead and make up their mind on how to approach it, with an undying desire to see another day, a better day.

Both sad and inspiring film, mellow, tender and rewarding.",2
"Andy said 'There are places in the world that aren't made out of stones .There is something inside that they can't get to ,that they can't touch .' This is the best movie I've ever seen, calm and warm, every details, every dialogue, go straight to my heart, every line is classic! Knowledge changes destiny. Close to the red ink near the black! Water can carry a boat and overturn it! The self-seeking life is not just a dream, just how to do it. Whatever the end, the process is important. A long road to freedom, a deep soul washing, an immortal inspirational classic,"" Hope ""follows God's will to sleep in the hollowed-out Bible inside, clinging to Andy's tall body, prostrate in a 500-yard sewer, and finally, the only dirty road to send Andy to the beautiful new world.",9
"Since everyone has already covered the bases, and don't feel like retyping all the same acclaims, I will simply say this touching, powerful film is single handedly one of the GREATEST FILMS EVER of the 20th Century!!! If you haven't already seen it for the wonderful acting, wonderful plot or wonderful directing, see it for Morgan Freeman's stupendous performance alongside some other class actors! This is one of his best works, which says a lot :o)",9
"What made this movie so great, was not the actors or the story, it was the narration by Morgan Freeman. His way of story telling really brought the story to life, along with great acting and a truly remarkable story by King.",6
"There is just so much good in this film.

I'm really surprised that it is ranked as highly as it is. I don't agree that it is the second best film of all time. I do think it is an extraordinary movie, tho.

I could go on and on about it, but many other people have already done that. But it is obligatory to say something, isn't it? How about:

You can make this movie very strange by getting lightly buzzed and pretending that Tim Robbin's character is actually Nuke Laloosh from Bull Durham. ;)",5
"The Shawshank Redemption movie is about importance of liberty in life. The movie is about how well you can hold your nerves and patiently waits and tries for freedom. It shows the value of a skilled person, how a person if he is perfect and smart in his skill can turn the things and earns differently more, than others.

Not only skills but if you rejects pessimism and keep aspiration in darkest and toughest stages in your life and have ability to create and find happiness from the little things you have by making friends, helping others by using your mastery and constantly keeping your efforts to reach to your destination. You will sooner see dawn of success.

The movie is really well made and I couldn't find any lack or part which bored me, from start to an end, it's an out and out interesting and engaging to watch. Leading actors' tremendous performances are really countable and strong reason in success of this movie. Highly recommended for everyone.",10
"Some movies are focused on being fast and interesting in the pacing, and other movies tend to the slow and satisfying build up to the grand finale. This is a movie that is somewhat on both ends. First of all - the film is long and takes it's time to resolve the issues that the protagonist encounters. Everything around the main plot is essential to almost every character in the film, which is one of the most important aspects of this title. The subplots all resolve around themes like humanity, depression, and the concept of miss-fists in society.

Tim Robbins plays the protagonist who's convicted of murder, and as we follow his life through the prison sentence and the impact he leaves on the other inmates, we get to see another side of each and every one of the stereotypes - that society usually depict as one sided criminals. The story is moving, heartbreaking and thoughtful. Morgan Freeman is also great and leaves us with one of the best supporting characters of all time.

So far ih've established that the story and characters are almost perfectly written and executed, but there's other things to consider. The cinematography is on point, and really captures the setting of life in prison, but also the claustrophobic and powerles feeling that the characters are induced with.

To round up! the movie is a perfect mix of interesting and thoughtful scenes with a good tempo, and a slow build up to a grand finale - with a satisfying catharsis in the end. The actors does a great job that makes us love and hate them in different ways and reasons. It's also a film that has something for everyone, and should be taught as a moral story in school. No film-school though! there are better examples of cinematography, but everything else is perfect, and the small details with the camera-work is not artistic as other films, but that's not bad and wouldn't fit the narrative anyway. One of the best movies of all time - No doubt!",8
"It wasn't even my idea. It was a female friends idea. I hadn't read any reviews. So i went and i watched it. And i thought it was quite a pleasant, well-made film. I didn't think it was the best film ever made. It was obviously different to your average Hollywood Blockbuster (the same year's Pulp Fiction it is not!)- slow paced with a director happy not to rush things.

And here we are nearly 20 years later and it's a lot of people's favourite film. It's not my favourite film but it's grown on me and i've been forced to reappraise it. And now i think it's a lovely film, lovingly made and when you've had enough of aliens blowing up The Whitehouse, scantily clad students dancing and wise-cracking cops shooting everything insight this is the antidote and really there should be more films made like this. It puts the ""good"" in ""feel good movie"".",9
"Honestly, it's hard to think of a movie better than this. It has everything on an emotional level. Fear, love, hate, temptation, sadness, happiness, and of course...redemption. I seriously mean everything. The ending when two friends finally reunite in the belief that they live happily ever after, is mesmerizing. The shot of Andy and Red hugging it out on the beach, as the camera zooms out sends chills down your spine. If you haven't seen this movie, I do not know what you are waiting for. The characters are all great, the acting is superb. The people they want you to root for are easy to root for, and the ones they want you to root against, are easy to root against. Superb job from the actors, directors, cinematographers, etc. One of the best movies ever made, maybe the best I have ever seen.",10
"This movie offers less in terms of plot twists, character development and acting than what I think people realise. Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around him.

There are few to no memorable quotes and even less action, and the only real twist, at the end, could be the most overrated twist of all time.

I only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics, only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments. If this movie has taught me anything, it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are, in general, conformist in nature ; they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up. Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie? The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like, but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes. A tub full of vomit to begin with.

Frankly, I do not care if this is an unpopular view. And neither should you. Popularity is a reflection of the current state of society's desires, nothing more.",10
"This movie is great. I watched it in 2020, 25 years after it was released & now I know why it's the best movie at IMDB. The story is absolutely amazing with a very nice end. It's not one of the endings where you're asking yourself what? Is that all? Do I have to figure out what's going to happen? The actors did a great job. Though the movie is very long it wasn't boring at once. Sometimes it's very sad and you feel bad for the Charakters, but very often you have to smile, not because it's funny, because it's amazing.",9

"This movie, though it's long, is worth watching over and over again. There are so many small lessons to be learned from this movie. I enjoy watching it on a rainy day. It makes me think of being in the military again deployed overseas in Iraq.",10
"I watched this movie when I was 11 years old with my mother for the first time. I had no idea what it was about before I watched it and never even heard of it. At the end, it changed the way I looked at movies. This movie taught me so much. I can't even start on how beautiful it is made, how well it is written, the cinematography, the acting, everything is just spot on.

Consensus: See it for yourself. That's all I can say.",10
"A really good movie, it's very touching. I feel bad for dufresne, but i'm also happy for him because he learnt something he never would have learnt if he was a free man. I give it an A+",10

"I've been watching 15 to 30 films a month for the past 5 to 10 years, and I evaluate a film by its ability to captivate my senses, regardless of how many times I've seen it. I don't have to tell you, then, how much I've adored this film. I suppose, for the sake of public appeal, Forrest Gump deserved the Oscar win, but Shawshank deserved the nomination, and Tim Robbins should've at least been nominated for best actor. What can I say? See the film- it's pure artistic perfection.",10
"I did not see Shawshank Redemption in the theater and was hesitant to see it because everyone told me what a great movie it was. Usually when that happens and I see the movie it never lives up to the hype, SR not only lived up to its hype but surprassed it. Anyone who didn't like this movie either has no heart or no brain. It's a movie which forces you in a gentle way to think and to feel.",10
"Frank Darabont's film based on Steven King's story is absolutely inspirational. Great performances all round and it keeps the viewer attached throughout. The Shawshank Redemption is quite long, yet you don't notice it, instead you notice the genius that has gone into this film's creation. See this film, no matter what your movie preference.",10
"The very rare film where there is nothing to complain about at all. An interesting plot, psychology, living characters, a wonderful ending. Many situations that are remembered after watching, even a very, very long time. I don't want to know what those black women were singing about ...

The main character is white, the narrator is black. Both are in prison (for various reasons). I will not retell, it is better to watch the movie itself. In general, I doubt that I can add fresh thoughts when more than a hundred reviews have already been written in the film. However, getting around such a challenge would be a crime. Although they do not put him in Shawshank for him)))

I watched the movie on a videotape presented to my relatives. Naturally, no longer. There is no recording for playback. I liked this film, and mom, and she, and the younger sisters, and surprisingly. Although usually we go to watch movies in different halls, and best of all - in different cinemas, if at all we go !!! Rare unity.

The film he watched was a contractor three times !!! Yes, this is also an indicator. Although personally, I probably would not have endured so much. For all its coolness, it is an emotionally saturated tape. Once I have enough on my ears. The second in a row is not necessary; )

Cunning and courage. He should be in prison, that he should be depicted as an illustration to ""C - means stress tolerance."" And these are very risky acts. Andy - you're cool - you're gorgeous - you're the best!

It is terrible, of course, that people get used to prison and it becomes their home. But not unbelievable. When I look at which employers have free people, I believe. And the bosses of a person are attracted, and to the leasing ... of soles - that means they will get used to the prison as well.

Not used to it. This makes me happy. It is inspiring. I want to say that if a person is able to solve such serious problems, that is, to go through all these minor problems. We are not even in the cells.

I would like to recommend such a cool movie to everyone, but remember that there are hard scenes there. Therefore, he may not go to someone's old parents. I'm not only because of the ""tin"", but also because for such a deep work you must first grow up a little; )",10
"When we have no choice but to encounter the kind of prison as xiaoshenke imprisoned the freedom of the soul, we are helpless old Brooke, frustrated red, or the wisdom of Andy?Use wisdom, trust hope, and brave fears to defeat it?

"You know, some birds are not meant to be caged. Their feathers are shining with freedom. A movie that can stand the test of time.",6
"When you talk about which film is the best? Some say it's Citizen Kane, the same goes for The Godfather 1 and 2, and pulp fiction. Well, pulp fiction and Godfather are good, nobody mentions this Stephen King adaptation. Man, I can't believe that it didn't even one single Oscar. The plot feels original, it's sometimes unique, and a nice adaptation. I want to be spoiler-free, and it's tough because It's flawless. Man, everybody got to watch this movie once in a lifetime, believe me, u won't be disappointed... This is the longest review I have ever written...",10
"When I first came across the title ""Shawshank Redemption"" I didn't have a clue as to what it was about, since I didn't know the plot. But it had Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as it's stars, so I figured that it was worth a peek. What a peek!! This movie is awesome!! Not the classic tale of a innocent man being sent to jail for a crime that he didn't commit, this movie was much more detailed. It shows you how cruel prison life can be. (Although, if you want a better picture of prison life today, I suggest watching ""American Me"") You have everything in this picture, Corrupt Prison Warden, Sadistic Guards, and a innocent man caught in the middle. You can not help but admire Tim Robbins character ""Andy Dufresne"" as he waits patiently for almost 20 years before he is able to rectify his situation. Talk about patience and perseverance! This is one movie that will tug at your heart. Excellent movie.",10
"What is there to say about The Shawshank Redemption? Clearly there is a reason for it's widespread popularity, and thankfully that praise is warranted. While far from the best film I've ever seen (it currently holds the #1 spot on IMDb), I can't argue against it being a great film. In particular, the performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are inspiring enough to power the film through it's slower passages. The cinematography has been praised for good reason as well, a lot of thought was obviously put into every shot to convey a certain feeling or message. Although I found the story arc to be somewhat predictable, the art of storytelling is the real star here, guiding us through themes that are masterfully simple on the surface, but have a lot going on underneath for you to think about later on. Really the only thing that held this film back for me is it's reliance on some rather cliché (at least at this point in time) plot developments amidst it's middle act. Being objective though, it's hard to tell whether that is the fault of the way it was crafted, or just the result of the film being so broad in it's scope. Either way, it stands the test of time as a film very much worth viewing. Maybe we have been looking at Shawshank all wrong. Maybe it's not so amazing because of how many people think it's great, maybe it's because of how few people there are that don't. It certainly has a message that everyone can appreciate.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is the quintessence of film regarding life in prison and the different aspects of the human condition. The film survives without needing hard violence, language, or sexual themes. Performances by the cast are what make this movie feel authentic and bring the characters to life.",9
"If I have to write a listo of 5 movies that you should see, this is one of them",9
"That's normally pretty hard to say, though the fact that the book is a Stephen King novella (150ish pages +/-) makes sense why the movie is better. Not bashing King here, just saying most of the movies based on his work tend to be pretty decent and novellas aren't meaty enough for my taste. Most the time when I finish a novella I wish there had been more substance.

As far as the movie goes, I'm sure everyone else has mentioned why it's so great. If you love this movie check out the book, they're pretty much dead on besides a few details. Unlike other novellas of King's e.g. Apt Pupil ... the extra details in that book made it so much better than the movie.",10
Probably one of the greatest movies ever made no wonder it's on the top of the 250 List. I was personally holding back from watching it but the moment I found out Morgan Freeman was in it I just couldn't resist. Indeed it's been quite some time since the movie got released but it's just one of those golden works of art that can be picture at any time or place,8
"A soul refreshing film, but the genre itself is. That doesn't put it above other genres, so I feel that the balance needs to be re-established in the ratings.9/10",10
"I absolutely LOVE this movie, and I've seen it many times over, but I've never thought of it in biblical terms before. I'm also not very religious so the Christ parallel did not occur to me. Now that you mention it, it's almost too obvious.",10
"Gripping..Compelling!! In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenance and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring. Though the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",9
"People look for all sorts of things in movies, and you can see it in the occasional negative review that pops up for this movie. Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen. Others are action junkies. Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle. For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.

At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people. That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly. It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray. But this movie absolutely sings with human spirit, and captures an universal human theme as well as any movie has ever done. And THAT is filmmaking at its finest. Not a game, not eye candy -- this movie stays with you long after the credits have rolled.",10
"I can't even go into words about how this film moved me. The themes of hope and friendship are the powerful strings that tugged at my heart through out. A flawless masterpeice with excellent performances by Freeman and Robbins. For years, I've heard a lot of talk about this movie. Damn, I'm glad I finally saw it.

10 out of 10....to say the least.",10
"I find it hard to believe how I missed this movie in the theaters. A friend of mine told me I should see this movie when it was taken off the new release rack. I looked at it and just shuddered. He had to rent the movie himself and drag me into his dorm room physically before I saw it.

I can't believe how good it was. He paused it for 10 minutes in the middle so he could answer the phone and I went nuts. I couldn't wait to see the rest of it.

I can't wait until this comes out on DVD. Until then, I will settle for my VHS copy. Go see this movie. :)

"I would be hard pressed to name my favourite film of all time.I'd find it difficult to name my top five films of all time. But any discussion on the topic(at least one conducted by people with an ounce of sense)would surely include this film. Two-and-a-half hours of intelligent moviemaking pass in a instant,and not once does it let you lose interest,be it because your'e laughing at a bunch of prisoners sitting drinking beer paid for by a hard-ass warden,or crying at Andy Dufresne getting raped by a big bull queer. The film is at times harsh and unforgiving,(the nameless inmate getting beaten to death comes at you virtualy straight away)but the over riding feeling is that of hope.""Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of things"".That sentence will appear on every trailer,poster and teaser that you'll ever see for Shawshank,because its the whole damn point.Hope is what makes us free,what drives us to carry on.I dont want to get too philosophical,but ""The Shawshank Redemption""is poetry on celluloid,a more majestic piece of moviemaking doesnt exist outside of David Lean. The fact that Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman were denied Oscars is scandalous,as I doubt that Robbins will ever give a performance as good as this one again(except for Cadillac Man,hes never been better)and Freeman proves once again that age leads to experience,and damn fine acting. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" finally gives me the oppurtunity to use the word ""poignant""in a review,so I'll do so. Poignant.Indeed.",10
"After seeing this movie again there isn't any words that I can think of to adequately describe what a truly great movie the Shawshank Redemption represents. Every human emotion was perfectly portrayed right down to the coldness of the Shawshank's concrete and steel. This is Morgan Freeman's best movie to date and likely Tim Robbins best movie ever. The cast's acting job is top notch. The period and setting, perfect. Thomas Newman's music score, perfect. Supporting cast, perfect. I think that this is the only movie that I can not think of one single thing that would improve it. Nothing. Owning this movie would be the crown jewel in anyone's collection.

If you haven't seen this movie stop reading this now and go to the nearest video rental place, rent this movie, and come home and spend the best 2+ hours you will ever spend watching a movie. Really! Stephen King is King. I can't understand what this movie is only #2 on IMDB and not #1.",10
"This film didn't win the Best Picture Oscar? It would have been under-appreciated even if it had won, an Oscar isn't worthy enough to be associated with this amazing film. They should have created a separate award for this movie--""The Best Film Ever"" award.",10
This is the perfect movie. There are longer reviews that do a great job of summarising why.,10
"Wow! after i watched it today I'm so moved and happy... The story is so good, the message is Hope and makes me love the movie more. The cast did a good job, I love this movie. Simple, realistic, emotional,funny and amazing. Plus I love the cleverness",9
"The feathers of some birds are too bright and should not have been kept in cages.

Perhaps the point of the story is not that Andy was finally freed from prison. Instead, he repaired the roof on the balcony and liked to watch everyone enjoy cold beer. Perhaps he would rather be detained and listen to a classical music. When people are the least free and when their personality is most disrespected, they do not abandon their firm belief that they are ""human."" This is the most precious thing.",10
"It's a good film that has no hostess, no love and no stunt. It's also a film that many college English teachers like to show to their students. It tells a very pure story. It's a redemption, in exchange for freedom. It's also a belief that drives him to do so. It's a touching film, which also makes many people grow up.",10
"If Hollywood were the bakery section at your local supermarket, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" would be that sweet rich carrot cake they sometimes have--obviously commercially produced to appeal to as many people as possible, but nevertheless infinitely better than a plastic-wrapped snack-cake like ""Forrest Gump"", which goes down easy but leaves a funny taste in your mouth for hours afterward.

Of course if this movie were a cake, I suppose it'd have a file in it.",10

"Shawshank Redemption ! probably the most watched, the most liked movie of its time and rightly so. The plot flows like a poetry, making the experience of watching surreal.

A young banker(Tim Robbins)is being framed for the alleged murder for his wife. The man pleads innocent but the court thinks otherwise and is given a long sentence in the jail and the name of the jail is Shawshank. The man is completely unassuming and brilliant. Taking sometime to get adjusted to the jail environment, he befriends many in the jail. The main one is Reed (Morgan Freeman)who smuggles cigars and other necessary things to the jail inmates.

The jail warden is Norton (Bob Gunton) who is a bible loving, strict person who hoards and involved in money laundering. Noticing the talent of the banker, he uses the banker's knowledge to launder the money. Meanwhile,a young guy is jailed for a petty crime and he confides to Tim Robbins something that could help him to prove his innocence. But the warden doesn't approve of it and he gets the young man killed.

On one fine day, Tim Robbins suddenly escapes from the citadel of Shawshank. How he planned it and the execution of it forms the next part of the movie.

The movie is perhaps the best prison break movie ever done. Stephen King deserves credit for this wonderful, intelligent story and equally wonderful characterization,the director of the movie for his surreal creation of the jail environment and actors for their brilliant performances. The movie could have been edited by a few minutes and could have been made well within 2 hours. That fact could be overlooked given the thrill,entertainment the movie provides.",9
"Amazing acting, props are the best, locations look such the part, one of the best films ever. Music matchs too. Emotions are mixed.",10
"What else is there more to say about this movie? If you haven't seen it yet, then you're missing out.

This movie gets so much right with such a strength that makes it hard not to love it. It has really good pacing which makes it hard to get bored even if the movie is almost 2 and a half hours, amazing characters that all feel real and three dimensional, great plot that takes a good idea to amazing heights and is able to send a message that you'll carry it in your heart, the shawshank itself feels like a living place, the jokes are also pretty good and they land well, the soundtrack is gorgeous.

Honestly, this movie is an easy must watch, even if you don't really like drama movies. So, give it a try, man!",10
"I'm certainly no movie critic, and I acknowledge my two cents makes no difference to anyone at all, especially for how universally well-received this movie is. I've never seen it before tonight, and this is, without a doubt, the most perfect movie I have ever seen. I don't have a critics perspective of what to look for when judging a movie, but this is the most fulfilled and satisfied I have ever been upon finishing any film, and it's also why it's the first movie I've ever felt compelled enough to review. Truly an experience to watch, straight through to the end.",10
"I can't think of a better American film. Two strong actors, a thorough director, raw emotion, and a tear jerking ending... and then let's not forget the memorable screenplay and score. This film is what makes going to the movies what it is. It's one of those cinematic defining films that's nigh impossible to replicate, and something like it may only come everything 30 years.",8
"That's right, this film is so amazing, it doesn't need to stand behind a flashy tag line in a review. this film can speak for itself, Frank Darabont's true masterpiece.

Tim Robbins gives an Oscar-gypt'd performance as Andy Dufresne, an upstanding banker, framed for murder and sentenced to two life terms. There he meets Red (played by the immortal Mr. Morgan Freeman, who gives us the best voice-overs in movie history.) In prison, Dufresne becomes well known with the inmates for his courage, after being raped basically everyday for a month, and hope that the justice system will see him through.

This film is a true masterpiece that can only come from years in the movie business, but Frank had close to none. He had only done two films before that weren't very good, I guess this proves what you can do with raw talent today.",10
"Shawshank deserves to be named one of the top 10 movies ever created and its a shame it came out the same year as Forrest Gump. Any other year in the 1990's and it would have obtained the Best Picture Oscar. Morgan Freeman gives the greatest performance of his career and considering all the memorable performances he's given, thats really saying something. Robbins is also terrific as Andy Dufrense, the wrongly convicted wife killer. James Whitmore also gives a memorable performance as the lovable Brooks Hatlen. Frank Darabont really outdid himself with this masterpiece. A must see for all ages!

My rating : @@@@@ (out of five)",10
"I wholeheartedly agree with reismark's review of the film. It is excellent. I want to note, however, as the treasurer of a library system, that people should remember that rental and purchasing are not the only options. If you learn about your local libraries, you'll find that many of them, perhaps most of them, have collections of video on VHS and DVD which rival rental stores. In most instances, these materials circulate without charge, although some libraries charge a nominal fee to rent very recent titles. In the library system to which I belong, even rental titles are potentially available free, since we insist that there must be at least ONE copy in the system which circulates without a fee.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic film that is a must see for anybody. It has one of the most intriguing and intersting stories of any film ever, and is well-directed, acted, and written. Everything about this film is fantastic.",10
"After reading it, it is thought-provoking.It is a great honor to see this movie.",9
"Definetely deserves the Top Spot On IMDB, The Shawshank Redemption was, is and allways will be my personal favourite Movie ever made. My highest Honor and the biggest Movie Recommendation i can made.",10
"Excellent movie I liked it a lot. Recommended to see it.

In 1947 Andy Dufresne, vice president of a major bank in Portland (Maine), is tried for the murder of his wife and a man with whom she was having an affair. Although he insists he is innocent, the evidence is reason enough for the judge to sentence him to serve two life sentences in Shawshank State Prison. Upon entering he realizes how harsh the environment is, the guards spare no effort in disciplining the inmates with the cruelest methods, especially the boss, Byron Hadley. This regime of terror has the approval of the prison warden, Samuel Norton.

During the first few months, Dufresne befriends the prison's smuggling kingpin, Red, and orders a hammer for hewing stones from him. He spends his time and his forces fending off constant harassment from a gang of rapists known as ""the Sisters,"" led by Bogs Diamond. Two years later, he is selected along with Red to repair the roof of one of the prison buildings, and while doing his job, he overhears Hadley complain about a tax mess caused by an inheritance received from her brother. Of the. He offers to help him and in this way he begins to gain the trust of the staff, including the warden. This fact frees him from the pressure of ""the sisters"", since Bogs is disabled after receiving a beating from the captain. Eventually, Dufresne is transferred to the jail library to help Brooks Hatlen, until he is paroled. However, Brooks commits suicide some time later due to the depression caused by the idea of having wasted his life.",10
"Took me a long time to see this movie, but finally decided to watch it and wasn't disappointed. Probably most movie fanatics know the movie so I won't focus on the movie that much, but the feeling of watching it. This one truly feels like a classic story with the storytelling, having a clear plot, but still keeping us on your toes on what is going to happen. It depicts in a real fashion on how life can be and not being boring at any point. Story guides on one direction, but every moment feels like it could turn to a different direction. Really great storytelling, creating the feeling of hopelessness, character build and classic plot from start to finish. I truly enjoyed watching this from start to finish, nothing felt superimposed.",10
"I have never seen a movie as powerful and inspiring as this one. There are many lessons to learn in each scene of this movie, which is among the best I have ever seen. I recommend watching it at least once.",9
No words to describe this movie. This is the best movie I have ever watched. It felt flawless ! It truly deserves to be the first in IMDB top 250. Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman are amazing.,10
"Before you write this review off, please know that rating it a 4 does not mean I hate this film.

My rating system may be a bit different than others. If a movie exists, I want to immediately give it a 5. A 5 seems very middle-of-the-road for me, and I want to give each film the benefit of the doubt. So, I automatically go into a film thinking it's a 5, and if it goes well or gets better as I watch it, that rating goes up. The rating goes down if I see more negative than positive aspects about the film.

I explain my rating process to ensure to others that I do NOT hate this film. I thought it was okay - nothing special - but far from a disaster, and yet, further from a masterpiece.

As this review is intended to be more advice for first-time viewers, let me get right to the crux of my view on the film: The Shawshank Redemption gets a lot of hype. It has been the pinnacle of many Top 10 lists since its release, and even IMDb here has it at the top of its Top 250. So, unless you have lived most of your life under a rock, you are fully aware of the attention and praise this film has gathered since 1994. Do not - I repeat, do NOT - go into the film expecting great things. If you can watch the movie without any preconceived opinions, that would be the best. You might thoroughly enjoy Shawshank. Going down the checklist, the movie has just about everything you need for a great film:

Theme: It's got ""redemption"" in the title, everyone. I think you can figure it out, but the film also touches on forgiveness, endurance, and friendship - all good themes to explore in film

Acting: Morgan Freeman is amazing, as always. Tim Robbins is loved by critics (I've never particularly cared for him), and does a decent job of conveying a full spectrum of emotions

Source Material: It's based on a Stephen King short story. Stephen King has been cinema gold, as far as I can tell. The Shining, Stand By Me, and The Green Mile have all been successful It all sounds so good, right? Well, I would definitely tell you to watch this film, as I think most films should be given a chance, especially modern classics such as this one. However, I would not believe all the hype.

For me, it was an average film with major expectations, and ultimately, I was let down. I can't say that watching this movie was anything like being in prison, but I could actually connect emotionally with Andy by the end of the film.",10
"The movie Shawshank Redemtion written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephan King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film potrays the story of a banker Andy Dufresne who is sentenced wrongfully for the murder of his wife and her lover. Andy was sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State prison. In the jail he forms a frienship with a inmates named Red. It mainly potrays how Andy dig a tunnel to escape prison and also of the fradulant jailer ,who was later exposed by Andy.",8
"I bought this film just due to its high score on IMDb. I was not disappointed. My comment to my wife after seeing this, was ""nothing actually happened, but I could still not take my eyes from the screen"". This movie works like emotional magic to a guy who normally swears to action, horror and FX movies. Hats off to the actors, the script writer and the director.

And no hats off to the IMDb people who make me write 10 lines. I don't care if I'm banned from writing more reviews by adding these final meaningless lines. I've used IMDb since it was born, and this is the first time I've actually felt like telling the world a movie is worth watching. It's probably also the last time, so just ban me from commenting further.",10
"I saw this movie last week and I must say that it is the most wonderfull movie ever made in human history. It contains all elements that makes a movie big, and how big, damn I was completely blown away when the movie ended. Its about a man (Andy Dufresne)(Tim Robbins) who is judged guilty and ends up in ""ThE ShAwShAnK PrIsOn"", he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and become friends, I've never seen such a great acting like this two together. Andy Dufresne is the hope itself and has to face a hard time in prison till...Im not gonna reveal the movie any further because YOU MUST SEE IT, Its just the best movie ever made, Memento, Schindler's list and American History X were awsome but this one will blow you completely away! 10 out of 10 and even more if it could be. --------ENJOY IT--------",7

"""I guess it comes down to a simple choice really. Get busy living or get busy dying""

This wonderful movie just explain that hope, solitude, and pain are worth for freedom

""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies""",10
"The #1-marked film is marked as demand by an increasingly institutionalized public, but that imaginary hope is a big joke. The deeply ingrained capital principle has shown various forms of beings on the Seventh Continent, which has been deprived of rights by those in power. Capital accumulation has become the only way for people to return to freedom and dignity. So The Shawshank Redemption is ultimately the redemption of the ruling class, it has nothing to do with being human.",9
This is potentially the best film ever made and one of the best films I've ever seen. It reminds me of Goodfellas and Casino because of the way they talk through what's going on at the time in the movie. I don't think I will ever see a bad film that includes Morgan Freeman in the cast. It has an interesting story also. The film was that good it has left me lost for words. I wouldn't usually watch a film about being in jail but I've heard that this was a classic and a must watch movie. It was different in many ways to what I would usually watch because what I would usually watch are action and comedy movies. I recommend this movie to children over the age of 10.,10
"I love it so much... I dont want to spoiler you, but you have to see it. I like how the characters are described and much more... You really have to see it!",8
This is one of the great films of all time. One of the 10 best I've ever seen. The cast is perfect. Tim Robbins was great! So too were Morgan Freeman as Red (a part actually written for a red haired Irishman) and Bob Gunton as the Warden. James Whitmore shows that small parts still require great acting and he is as good as ever. I recommend this film highly.,10
"The movie cannot be expressed in Words, Awesome it was, Just beautiful",10
"I hadn't watched this film in its entirety in probably 10 years so I felt it was time for a re-watch. It still holds up as one of my favourite films from the 90's. The very intricate adaptation of King's work is so smartly done by Frank Darabont. You have to pay attention to all the little details in order to make sense of the film at the end. Its no easy task as the movie can move at a snails pace at times, but that's what makes it so great. Its not trying to be flashy, its trying to portray a very realistic view inside a mid 20th century New England prison. You come to feel for every single one of these characters and most importantly understand their motivations. A film like this could have went so badly, but the actors and Darabont seem to make it look effortless. The cast as an ensemble works wonderfully and Morgan Freeman quite possibly gives the best performance of his career.

Its too bad this film was released in a year that saw it competing against Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. One of the most underrated films of the last 20 years. If it had been a different year, it could have cleaned up at the Oscar.s I don't know if it deserves to be #1 on IMDb's 250, but it definitely deserves a high spot.

9/10",10
"Shawshank Redemption is entertaining and well made. It's not, however, the greatest movie of all time. It's a thoughtful film and is remarkable for appealing to people who don't usually put a whole lot of thinking into their cinema. It covers the greatest range of viewers for like-ability from the Fast and the Furious crowd to the Lost in Translation audience. I don't think it'd attract big numbers from the cinema nerds of Eraserhead fandom though. That's not to say that Lynch fans should have a more weighted vote on IMDb. It's just that if you're into your cinema and you watch a lot of good films, from obscure to popular, then being told Shawshank Redemption is the best film of all time is like hearing someone say Radiohead is the best band ever. Yes, they're very good but you suspect their cheerleaders are only comparing them to Coldplay, U2 and REM.",10
"Movies are meant to entertain. Most of the times, they even fail to do that. In this era, dominated by Computer Generated Imagery (CGI), most movies project an alternative reality, a getaway from our dry world. In such manner, it is fun to watch and even very entertaining.

Only might bring up The Dark Knight, which is also a truly great movie, in such conversations but in the end it is futile.

The Shawshank redemption is a class of movies, which until now has only got itself in it. This movies forces us to question ourselves. Through these movies, we live someone's else life and understand it.

It is entertaining as hell not cause of the imagery or the camera work or the some cool gadgets rather cause it strips down the beautiful human nature and portrays the intricate feelings in a form so powerful that it may be more of a reality than this life is.

Every time you watch this movie, you learn about yourself. You grow. You believe.

With lots of awe admiration and respect, A Shawshank Redemption Fan",10
"Shawshank captivates human emotion on a deep level. The characters are believable and deep, the story is immersive and captivating, and it is long enough to truly paint a canvass. The performances are powerful and true. I do believe this to be one of the ten to fifteen truly timeless pieces that will never age. It is amazing.

Definitely own it.",10
"What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again",10
This is the most overrated movie ever made and being above The Godfather and The Dark Knight on the best movies of all time lists is a joke.,10
"This is a movie about grit and determination, about never giving up. About what a man can achieve when he believes in a visison and gives everything. Brilliant.",10
"First I must say that The Shawshank redemption is with no doubt a masterpiece.It is important to say that these days Hollywood is not making quality artistic movies,it is all about blockbusters,high budgets,commercial movies and special effects.Well,this movie on the contorary is one of the most important films of the 90's and maybe the most touching movie of all time.Full of or realist emotions this movie touches the heart of the average viewer in a very impressive and original way.It is a tale of hope and dreams of freedom.In 1994,almost unknown Frank Dourbunt created a movie that changed the movie history and showed to people that in the day of special effects and extremely gory film there can be a film totally different from all the others.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are great in this movie and they really deserved numerous awards that they received for making this film.There are many people who claimed that his movie changed their way of living and thinking in a good way and that is the biggest thing that a product of the 7th art can achieve.",1
"I don't know how to say about this movie. This is the movie which tells me its theme the strongest of all movie I have ever watched. I think the theme of this movie is Living. The location is the prison where most people may lost their hopes, but people lives there spend their life in their own way. There are many problems which we don't want to recognize it is true in prison. This movie shows that there are a lot of people manage to live in such a terrible place. All People have different life, and all people live desperately and all people will die someday. The way to live is different like the life. Some people finish their life by themselves, and others try to keep their life hardly whatever happened. Nobody knows what is right and what is wrong, but one thing I'm sure is they everyone can have hopes and it doesn't make us unhappy. Having hopes can lead us to our future, even if it takes a long time. I learned those from this movie. I think the more I watch this movie the more I can learn from that, so I want to watch this movie again and again.",10
"A tremendously gifted ensemble, magnificent music by Thomas Newman, and a first-rate story and directing by first-timer Frank Darabont push this cinematic alchemy.",10
This movie is truly amazing. The cast is brilliant. all the actors are acted very well and they are very talented. well directed masterpiece work. This movie is realistic. The escape plan from the prison is great.,10
"Such a beautiful quote: "" Hope is such a beautiful thing afterall""",9
"Getting to see The Shawshank Redemption was for me a lengthy process, but when I finally caught it it was more than worth the wait. In the history of movies there have been many impressive debuts from promising directors. With The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont has vaulted himself into the ranks of Orson Welles and John Huston. There has not been a more memorable movie experience in the last decade, and it gratifies me to see that users of this site regard this film as highly as it ought to be.",10
"Movie starts with a murder and everything goes normally, the dialogues and the feel of this movie are too diplomatic and at the end its like a parabola,everything reverses .",10
"I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.

The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",10

"Shawshank is Masterpiece. The Music acting script story and message are top notch. The only movie that comes close to this one is WALK HARD - The Dewey cox story. Forrest Gump won best picture over Shawshank this year, and that may be my 3rd favorite movie after WALK HARD. But shawshank feels like real life and Forrest Gump's story is almost all impossible and Rediculous. To make a movie and wonder if it's a true story is alot harder to do than make some mumbo jumbo that would never happen.

Shawshank #1 greatest of all time

WALK HARD - dewey cox #2 best of all time

#3 Forrest Gump.",10
"The 30 years friendship of Andy and Red was shown with great emotion and blossomed over time into a life's eternal love.

Red: ""I would like to think that Andy fought back against the mothers but he didn't.""

Red constant support and gifts to Andy everytime he had sex with another inmate was so heart warming.

Finally, Red's overwhelming joy when he was freed after 30 years in prison and his only thought was seeing Andy.

Red riding the bus to Mexico: ""I was like a child who couldn't hold a thought in his head. I couldn't stop thinking of seeing my friend Andy again and shaking his hand.

Red traveled thousand of miles and the scene where they hug again on the beach then the movies fades to the The End.

What a way to start a lifelong love affair.",10
"I started of watching this movie without any 'hype'. I knew it was a good film since it claimed the #1 spot in the IMDb top 250 movies.But after the credits rolled down,i very well understood why it claimed the #1 spot. This is a gem of a movie. If you missed it, then go watch it. It doesn't have speedy car chases,gripping war sequences or thumping action. But it conveys a strong & warm story to the viewers holding them close. I cant stress more. This is a 'must watch before you die' movie. or you'll cry in the heaven,having missed out this masterpiece... Morgan freeman & Tim Robbins are outstanding. They make the movie unforgettable with their outstanding performance.Each & everyone contribute their best in this movie.The background score is also superb,although it is less. I give it 9.5/10",10
"I would agree with others that this movie isn't anything particularly special. It certainly doesn't rank up among Godfather or Casablanca IMHO. But it is a good movie, it has it's heart in the right place, and works on a lot of different levels. Morgan Freeman is perfect and Tim Robbins is servicable as two people who meet in prison and develop a friendship. I also found the film to have good re-watchability value.

I found this movie to be flawed in two main areas. First, time simply does not seem to pass at all in prison. No effort is put into making the characters age at all, even though twenty years passes over the course of the film. The second is that the ending occasionally strays into tedium as the film struggles to get every payoff in. But the heartfelt message is not forgotten, nor is the depiction (although obviously sanitized) version of prison life.

All in all, this is Hollywood, and considering Hollywood films, this is one of the better ones.

8/10",10
"Frank Dabaront is not a name that is known to everybody...He certainly isn't the most popular director on the planet. Regardless, he has made a film that has touched people all over the world. The film that is brutal, yet astonishing: Shawshank Redemption.

I first of all, wasn't surprised at all that this was the highest-rated film on IMDb. It has every ingredient a film needs...Universe, creation, acting, and a powerful storyline. The rare film that extraordinarily grabbed me and never let go...Also the rare film that exceeds in every aspect.

The film is obviously believable too, Freeman and Robbins pull in extra perfection to it. Freeman is a brilliant narrator, and he tells us the plot like it was rehearsed a couple thousand times! Robbins is also surprisingly great, he plays the (main) character with adorable gratitude and unstoppable force. His performance is worth watching over and over again...

Overall, its not for everyone to see (like the impeccable Forrest Gump), but it all shapes up with a powerful ending and a strong message.",10
"I saw this movie in 2019, because it was #1 in IMDB. It was nice movie, but I have seen many films like this, nothing extraordinary. I cannot understand its ranking.",10
"This Movie is just awesome, I am just speechless & thrilled watching this epic screenplay.

People watching this will also definitely love watching the Prison Break T. V Series too. Similar concept but gang based, you will love this ride as well.

But coming to movie , it just got this vibe like no other. Would love to see these type of intellectual movies more.",10
I love this movie. I always to watch this movie again and again. I watched 100 times but still i want to watch again. Usually i dont like to watch movies but this one i don't why but i fall in love with it.,9
"This film is so amazing. This is about a man called Andy who is found the guilty of the murder of his wife and her lover and sentenced to a prison. He struggles to get through hardship. He is so smart that he becomes an outstanding person. First of all, this film is narrated by the second lead character, Red, which makes the audiences see Andy from Red's view unconsciously. His smartness leads to an incredible ending. Each scenes are dropped advance hints, and in the end, each pieces are put together. His smartness blew me away. This film makes us think about what the life is. The last scene is incredibly beautiful. This film is definitely one of masterpieces.",10
A brilliant movie that carries a weightful massage & presented it perfect way possible.,10
The film shows the sinister circumstances of prisons in the US in former times. The plot tells of an unbreakable friendship that has grown for all these years behind bars. Hope dies last...,10
"I like ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but cannot understand why it is rated so highly. While it's well-acted, the direction is pedestrian, and the story is derivative.

While it should be somewhere in the top 250, rating it above movies like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""The Seven Samurai,"" ""Chinatown,"" ""Memento,"" etc. strikes me as ludicrous.",8
"It is a movie that catches your attention from start to end. Besides the great storytelling, what I most love about this one is the great cast with strong performances and the fact that the main character is indeed intelligent. He is very smart along the movie, so clever most of us didn´t see his plan coming. Every character in the film has a very defined personality and adds to the plot. The ending is great.",10
"This movie is absolutely superb. You watch it and all the simple, unremarkable details just cumulate and you realise that this movie, by being unflashy and ordinary is telling a powerful story about hope and redemption. Andy seems to be the main character but it is Red who finds himself, who is redeemed.

The Shawshank Redemption was overlooked because it looked unremarkable. But this movie has to be seen. My friends are action movie fanatics but they were all stunned by this movie. Stephen King should be thanked for writing the novella and the director should be praised for bringing it to the screen in such fine form. Forget Forrest Gump, this was the Best Picture of 1994.",10
"This is a rare kind of movie. A movie about the development of a friendship under the hardest conditions.

Being a huge fan of Stephen King's original novella, and considering past attempts to make his stories into movies, I was very sceptical when entering the theatre. But I have never seen an adaptation of his work which moved me in the way this one did. Director Darabont even get away with turning Red into an African American. Actually I think the movie is superior to the written version.

The main reason for this movie's strength is the two leading characters, brilliantly brought to life by Tim Robbins, (should have been Academy Award winner) Morgan Freeman. Together with the director they make this into a universal story and the American movie of the decade.

The only drawback is the ending. In my opinion it should have ended with Red getting on the bus. In that way each of us could create the ending we preferred. Most of us would have chosen the same one as the director but as it is presented I think it is a bit over the top. And that is sad for a movie of this kind.

Still, if I had to go to a deserted island bringing only one American movie from the nineties this would be it.",10
"OK, so I am a huge fan of Stephen King as well as of the cinema itself, and it took me almost 5 years to finally see The Shawshank Redemption. I think I was one of the few people on the planet who did not see this fantastic motion picture. Everything about this film exudes greatness, from the performances of Freeman and Robbins to the masterful screenplay, cinematography, cast and especially the direction. I agree with most people who fume over the fact that films such as this one (perfect in every sense) rarely, if ever garner an Oscar win. Its a shame that the big budget over - hyped (and often mediocre at best films) win all the awards while a gem like The Shawshank Redemption comes up empty. You never grow tired of watching this film and its introspective ending is just perfect. If you are one of the 4 remaining people who has yet to see this masterpiece, find 2 hours of quiet time and watch it. You will thank yourself afterwards.",9
"The makers of this film have proved that in the last 20 years the true meaning of film has not been lost. This film was terrifc. It was amazing. It was the best script I ever heard. A true master-piece. The acting was great. The film involved so much. Anger, hate, love, friendship, hope, sadness, happiness, freedom and it dealt with all emotions. It was truely a magnificent motion picture. The film gives off true feelings of life. True emotions. The sadness and loneliness in life.

The film tells you that hope is not sometime that is good and this is so true. The script tells you another part of life. It has a happy ending but it goes through all the parts of life. It is a movie based on life. It is all about life. To be free.

The story is a man who is wrongly accused for a crime he did not commit and sent to jail where he meets a man who guides and helps him along the way.

I give this film 10 OUT OF 10. It is absolutley brilliant.",10
"What praises can I sing about this movie that haven't been sung already? However, what this movie DID do was surprise me. I don't know whether I should have expected the movie's ending or not, but all the same it did give me a bit of a shock. While some of the things have been seen before many times (the bible-thumping hypocritical warden, for one), I was pleased with some of the lines from the movie (""Trust in the Lord...your ass belongs to me.""), and delighted with how the movie was wrapped up so neatly. See this movie not as an artsy, thematic flick, but see it as an excellent, expertly done story, and you will agree with me when I say it's one of the five best movies of our decade.",10
"I am a great fan of Stephen King's books. But not his movies. The critics are right. That includes Roger Ebert. It includes Maitlin's Summary. It includes the Academy voters. If you like horror movies over classics then this is a must see.

But it is run-of-the-mill prison fare otherwise. Anyone remember Michael Caine? It is not that this isn't entertaining. It's just simply that this film doesn't belong in the top 250.",10
"This movie is spectacular. It keeps you dangling on your seat, gets you leaping onto your feet, attracting, repelling, and always surprising.

I was SO AMAZED. I still am, you know.

At first, he was just one of the new guys, that ""tall glass of water with a silver spoon up his @$$"", a quiet, hotshot banker/wife killer. Next, he was Andy, the sculptor, the friend, the goody-goody...or was he? Red wasn't sure, the audience wasn't sure. Red thought he knew Andy, and so did we, despite (or because) of the suspenseful movie trailers and reviews.

Thought.

If you haven't seen it, then may God rest your soul. Meanwhile, do yourself a favour and go see it. Rent it, borrow it, watch it with friends, by yourself, whatever...and believe me: you'll feel a WHOLE LOT BETTER.",9
"This movie is a wake up call for everyone: so many life lessons, so many quotes that will remain forever in your mind. The acting is amazing, the story, the script, the music. Everything is just perfect 'Get busy living or get busy dying'",10
"Shawshank Redemption, which now is praised highly for it's brilliance, wasn't a major hit when it was released. Over the years we have understood the subtle spots of life which the film hits on. As time passes this piece of art will grow bigger in its cultural influence and will keep shedding light on the real motive of cinema i.e to potray shades life as they are. A must watch for everyone!",10
"The most powerful note about hope. Good movies, like good songs, will not be forgotten with the passage of time.On the contrary, every time we watch and listen, we will have new harvest and different experience.From the first time I saw it, to the time when the negative frustration came,I always turn on this movie to get the courage and strength to face life.",10

They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.

One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.",10

"Widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made, The Shawshank Redemption could make the list for that reason alone. But it's also worth a re-run to truly appreciate all the cinematic details of the film without becoming preoccupied with the plot and Morgan Freeman's luxurious voice (just us?). Oh, and there's also those Stephen King Easter Eggs. The author (who is said to have never cashed in his cheque for the movie) also penned the classics The Shining and Stand By Me and there are subtle nods to both in the film.

Way before twisty Oscar-bait dramas (paging Gone Girl) and TV gems like Line of Duty, Daphne du Maurier was the queen of writing sketchy characters. Her mysterious 1951 novel 'My Cousin Rachel' was turned into a film back in 1952 and was nominated for four Academy Awards the following year. However, it's the more recent cinema adaptation starring Rachel Weisz that's been lauded as a truer interpretation of the novel, and it's Weisz's brilliantly elusive acting that makes it a 'must watch twice' kind of movie.",10
"Morgan Freeman voice is irritating. I dont know why he was selected to this movie, Robert De Niro would be much better.

The movie is full of improbable scenarios. First, I find it hard to believe that no other prisoner wouldnt notice his digging during nights. And we know he must have done the digging during night.

Secondly, such long tunnel as illustrated on the movie between cell and utility corridor wouldn't be possible, as there are no such solid walls. Thirdly, if he escaped he wouldnt be able to put poster on the hole properly, so guard would spot the hole when he entered the cell. He didn't spot it, so it makes the plot unreliable.

Overall very poor movie, particularly the ending. If you want real piece of prison movie, watch The Glass House, The Glass House or Hole. Shanshank Redemption is overhyped movie that doesn't stand realities.",10
"This I have to say was one of my favorite movies of all time. I didn't see it until 1998 though. I had heard about it, but never actually had seen it. But when I did, I went out and bought it on video. I've always liked Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins has become a favorite of mine too. For some reason I like prison movies. It's just the suspense that really gets me. Movies like Escape From Alcatraz, The Green Mile, Instinct, and The Last Castle are among my favorites. To anyone who has not yet seen this movie, go rent it tonight, you will not be disappointed!",10
"It is not the first time that a movie presents the development of a drama in a U.S. prison. It contains elements of violence, depravity (of prisoners, their guards and the director), corruption, indifference, injustice, loneliness, solidarity, ingenuity developed by limitations, perseverance and tenacity to develop for more than two hours a good human story culminating in a happy ending ""Hollywood-style"".

It highlights the good performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the telling of the story from the point of view of one of the inmates (Freeman), the criticism of the prison system culminating in the desire of their oldest prisoners to stay there instead of the alternative of dealing with a hostile and unknown world as soon as they are released from this status to their new freedom (the Netherland's syndrome).

It is a message of perseverance, faith and strong commitment to a goal from inmates unfairly treated and judged as well as of indifference from a society that had created this scheme.",10
The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the best movies ever made.It is a simple yet powerful story that really touches your heart. The strength of this movie lies in the fact that the director does not use anything flashy to entice the viewers in this movie. The music by Thomas Newman adds depth and character to the movie and certainly enhances the overall appeal of the movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman prove that good acting trumps over everything else. Frank Darabont also deserves a lot of credit for his direction. It does not feel that this is his first movie. The cinematography of this movie is also excellent and Roger Deakins has done a wonderful job. The biggest strength of this movie is that it tells us to be brave in adverse times and not lose hope even in bad times. We can learn a valuable lesson from this movie and also realize the value of patience. Anyone who has seen this movie will agree with me and most of the people will love to see The Shawshank Redemption again.,10
"There's an essential part of the premise of this movie: you're not supposed to think Andy killed his wife. Andy's a good guy, it clearly was a terrible coincidence.

The movie takes great pains to give the impression that there even is a plausible second possible person who would have killed Andy's wife.

Here's the thing though. If you were on that jury, you definitely would have voted guilty for Andy. Because there is no way, if you were in that court room, you would be dead certain Andy did it.

The beauty of a good movie is the power it has in rewatching, but I think what's rewarding about returning to The Shawshank redemption is thinking about it from the perspective social perspectives. The first time, you're listening to Morgan Freeman tell you about his friend. The second time, you know Andy like he's a friend of your own.

But if you watch it again, given the film is in some sense about how we construct and constitute justice, you can consider it from different perspectives.

What I think is fascinating about this film, is at some point you realize--despite what the film invites you to believe, Andy absolutely killed his wife. That's not a spoiler--but that's the conclusion I reached after my fourth or fifth time watching the movie. And the beauty of the film is that it only becomes more beautiful and more poignant once you realize that what is one of the most important central conceits for the first time watching the movie is in fact completely implausible, and that the desire to believe Andy didn't kill his wife warps the entire narrative that follows. That's what makes this movie a timeless classic, that at different point in your life you can believe fundamentally different--diametrically opposed--principles of the core tenets of the film. That's craftsmanship.",10
Good stuff shawshank very emotional watch like a look,9
"I have enjoyed this movie so much, exilent acting...",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"", like ""Lord of the Rings"", is an exemplary film. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The actors all do a fine job, from Morgan Freeman to Tim Robbins. The plot is outstanding, probably because it used one of Stephen King's best novels as a screenwrite. And the setting, well what can you say? Shows prison from a whole new standpoint. As of now, this film is tied with ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the best movie I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.",10
"The best movie I've ever seen I can't remember how many times I've watched this movie over and over again, no matter how many times I see it, I can tell the next part right away. But still not bored. Actually, the film is not rushed, not climax, but the humanity that the film brings is so intense. Movies teach us to appreciate what we have, our loved ones and friends by our side.

When we stay, it's just a place of land, when we go, the land turns into a soul. Vietnamese idioms are very suitable for the movie. Even in the dungeon, it is a hard, dirty place, but when we have lived with it for too long, too much, when we leave, that land is an unforgettable memory.",8
"I've seen this with my grandparents countless times (mostly because when it's on TV, they don't even budge to change the channel, which I never minded) & even to this day, I still enjoy it. It's not THE GREATEST FILM I EVER SEEN/SAW but it's so good and every time I watch it, I still cry. It's this film and The Green Mile that enjoy

Morgan Freeman aka God Tim Robbins aka Susan Sarandon's ex bar give great, fantastic performances.

Sorry this review is short or unworthy to be read, but I can't really explain my review without gushing over it, but I recommend it to anyone willing to watch",10
"Perfect Watch !!! The carefully crafted and brilliantly written characters, phenomenal performances along with the fantastic story intertwine to execute one of the greatest films in history.

A seriously good film bringing more meaning into how important life out of prison really is and yet how scary anything all the way to being a grocer assistant can be, especially for ex-cons. This movie was studied by my English class in high school everything even down to the lighting cues and the heightened sounds resembles power: who can dominate and who can't. Outstanding Movie, stinks that they had to add the extra bit at the end, the original ending was way better. But fine, shows you that critics comments do play vital parts on a movies well being.",10
"While the movie truly is one of the best ever made in terms of the impact is has had on so many people (IMDB #2), I hope people understand that in this case, most of the power comes from the story, the rest from the presentation. I was a Stephen King fan when i was young and this story was one of the reasons.

The flaw in the movie comes right at the end. The movie simply goes on for about 30 seconds too long. Storytelling is also about knowing how to end a story and King got it right in the book. The movie's ending does not contain the same wonderous, makes-you-think impact that King's does and that's a shame because for me the movie is now less than perfect when it actually deserves 10/10 on its own merit. Oh, what it could have been !!

Another King story ends well, Firestarter, and they did get it right in the movie. But Firestarter isn't as good as ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Nothing much is.",1
"The finest movie ever made, no question. If you can sit through this and not be moved by the sheer power of the story, performances and imagery you are not of this earth. I had already read the Stephen King short story so the ending was no surprise but, guess what, it didn't matter ! That was just the cherry on top of a supreme masterpiece of chocolate cake. This is the current yard stick by which all other movies should be measured against. The basic foundation of the film is so strong that all the other parts must have dropped into place with ,seemingly, effortless ease. Hopefully one day something better will come along that will shift the goal posts once again. But for now, The Shawshank Redemption is a more than worthy No. 1 on IMDb.",10
"What have we become, if not a nation of lost beings? We seem to be starving from the ravages of unmet needs and relentless fear-- festering deeply a growing malnutrition of the soul. Indeed, was there ever a time when human beings truly lived to the full measure of their capacity for good?

Every once in a while a story is so beautifully constructed that we find a penetrating transformation has overtaken us, defying explanation, yet is as instinctively recognizable as joy, or laughter, or even deep sorrow. Such is the work of Writer/Director Frank Darabont in his powerful motion picture tale, ""The Shawshank Redemption"", which is based on a most unassuming parable by Stephen King.

Only through redemption will our nation find its way; and it is only by the people, those individuals who refuse to compromise their capacity to create beauty--or better, recognize it--who will guide us to our true potential as a society, or more fundamentally, as a planetary species.

Indeed, beyond redemption is a lighted pathway to our intended destiny, where fear transforms into compassion and hope becomes the new reality, ever nourishing our spirit.

Remember how you felt after watching this film? Though it may be true that we have never met, in many ways I know who you are. And with that insight wells up a comfort so luminous it lights this pathway on which, through all the mysteriousness of the vast universe, we both travel ever onward and upward.

"Im honest the movie is not a 10/10 its more like 9,5 but its still such a masterpiece, everyone who see this trust me and watch this movie its great, it would be a 10/10 if the first half of the movie would be a little bit faster, but thats not so bad, so we can understand it better how a life is in prison, but the second half is so unbelivable good, the second half of the movie have so many stunning moments, but i dont wanna spoil you the best thing you can do after reading my review is watching the movie and overthink everything, im honest i love ,, The Shawshank redemption'' so much.

And yeah ik my english is not the best but i hope you understand what i mean.",9
"An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!

Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing..

Based on a short novel by Stephen King, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" the movie is as much a fantasy as any of King's horror stories, yet thanks to screenwriter and director Frank Darabont, there isn't a moment we don't want to believe in. Darabont uniquely blends humor and violence, sweetness and brutality, in what may be the best ""feel-good"" movie of the last twenty years. Ultimately, it is a story of hope and triumph, a tribute to Man's ability to overcome all odds. Andy never fails to astound us with his courage and cunning. He manages to ingratiate himself with the guards when he begins doing their tax returns and with the inmates when he helps build the finest prison library in Maine. (And managing to get them a cold beer on a hot day doesn't hurt, either.) Andy's final surprise, though, is his best, and it is enough to encourage even old Red to face the real world. .",9
"The man teach us a very simple lesson on having hope, through his actions, through his honesty and determination towards what he believes!!",10
"The best film I've ever watched, if you haven't watched this film, not only do I pity you, I also resent you. This movie is a masterpiece. this movie is the best. This is one of the very few films that I will call perfect,The greatest and best end of a movie in history,I consider it the best movie ever",10
Watch it yourself and then you will be Speechless too,10
This is one of the best moves ever. Great story and great actors.,9
"This picture is a rip-off from the Clint Eastwood movie called "" Escape from Alcatraz"" When you watch it carefully you'll notice the similarity between the two of them. And not only this movie is a rip-off , the Clint Eastwood's movie is also a stolen idea from the movie called "" A Man Escaped "" an old classic french movie.",9
"A thriller Lover Must See this Movie without thinking..

StoryLine was very Good , May someone call slow bt i think that was necessry.

Acting: 10 on 10.

Screenplay: 9/10

Direction on that time and the story build up of this moviw will blow your mind.

MOst importent of a movie was a good story, acting, scrrenplay, climax. Everything you will get in this movie.

At time of movie release , it was flop, but now people can understand this musterpice movie.

This review was withiout spoiler , so all i can say that whoever didn't see this movie, see it, you don't dis appointed, just don't see this forwarding, see this with full concentretion.. It will satisfy you, At least I can assure that... Happy Watching ❤",10
"Best drama ever. I've got many favorite movies, and I've always been unable to name my all times favorite movie, since my moods change, sometimes I want comedy, sometimes action, and sometimes, drama. One thing I am sure of tho, and that's the superiority of The Shawshank Redemption amongst it's genre. It may not be completely realistic, it may have a few cliches, but I don't see why some people seem to think that an utterly entertaining and well made movie suddenly isn't just that anymore if it has a few silly things in it.

For the last 12 or so years I've watched movies like a true fanatic, thousands and thousands of them, and I've pretty much seen all the ones that count. Everyone has a right to opinions, but I'm telling that you truly do think that this movie doesn't _deserve_ it's place in the top 5 of IMDB, you are clueless.",10
"This movie was very entertaining. The acting of morgan freeman and tim robbins, were exceptional, as well as the other actors. Even though very violent, it's extremely entertaining. The script was very good, and had some humorous lines, which were hard to notice. This movie is one of the best ever, and should have one for best picture, best actor and best director. One of Stephan Kings best novels, to become a classic motion picture.",9
"Wonderful, wonderful movie, one of the greatest stories ever told. Terrific acting, and some of the best dialogue that I have ever heard before in a movie. Brillant screenplay and excellent directing. Why didn't this movie win Best Picture?",10
"Based on Stephen Kings novel, this film tells the tale of a man (Tim Robbins in excellent form), sentanced to 2 life sentances for the double murder of his wife and her lover.

Inside he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and over the next 20 years tells the story of his life and the lives around him.

This is not a very happy movie although (turn away if you dont want any idea of the ending) has a happy ending. Thats a double negative, but the film shows the graphic violence of prisons in the 1940's, where men are forcefully raped.

Two lines (both spoken by Freeman) really stand out in this film. See if you know what they are.

10/10",10
"Wow, what can I say. This film just blew me away entirely. I was never much of a Tim Robbins fan, but now I want to see everything he's in. He carries off his role in this movie with this wonderful quiet dignity and patience. I recommend this film very highly.",9
Probably the best movie ever made... Motivational... Quotes are simply amazing...,5
"I literally fell in love with this movie. The film is not melodrama and does not attract, but the essence and what it bears is greatness. He's definitely on my favorites list. the plot is this: Andy was a successful banker when evil rock overtook him. He was accused of killing his wife and her lover. The judge sentenced him to serve two life sentences in Shoushenk prison. He arrives in jail. As always, enemies, fights and allies appear. Further, it is respected by many for not being killed by grief, and showing strength of mind. Andy helps the guards with their problems, having solved the issue of this guard, he gained fame as a smart banker and began to solve the problems of everyone in the prison and, first of all, the chief, doing various frauds. Once, one prisoner told Andy that in the prison in which he was sitting there was a prisoner who admitted to him that he had shot two, and that the husband of the woman he killed was accused of murder. Andy immediately went to the boss, but received a month in a punishment cell and the storyteller was killed. But Andy, although in prison for the 19th year, does not give up. Of course, one cannot fail to single out the acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Robbins' hero is not just a man who managed to escape from one of the most impregnable prisons (although he succeeded brilliantly!), He is a man of his kind who defied the justice system, which, despite all its alleged perfection, sometimes makes fatal mistakes and of course he is the one who showed that even behind the strongest and highest walls in captivity, you can feel like a free person and be as much as possible.",10
A must seen movie that shows you the greatness of cinema.,10
"In the whole movie, the two best actors reflected the dark background of a prison at that time and their yearning for a new life and freedom to the audience through the language communication between them, which was really touching. The story is coherent and full, making people want to see the first time also want to see the second time. Worth watching!",9
Man's life is just going from one cave to another. And then continuing to shiver in the rain of that world.,10
A movie worth watching one of all time favorites movies.,10
"Simply one of the most intelligent and most enjoyable films ever made. Genius frank darabont utilises Stephen king's masterwork perfectly. Couldn't be praised any more really. All is great, from emotional performances by robbins and freeman, to storytelling qualities and the ability to retain fans interest.

Must watch experience!",9
Don't read the book first it kinda ruins the story for you cos you know what's gonna happen it is a very good movie I reccomend it a lot I'm just gonna spam random words so I fit 150 characters and I can't fit the whole team anymore I just can't fit that I have ever had so I have a hard way lol.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is, by far, one of the greatest films of the 90's, if not of all time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are perfect as the two leads in this very moving, human story. With excellent direction (Frank Darabont), a fantastic story (a short by Stephen King), and a great supporting cast, this film is a masterpiece.",10
"I have never ever felt the feelings i felt watching the masterpiece of a movie, its really manages to play hard on the watchers emotions, I think I was feeling happy , then sad then angry and in the end a sense of justice...

This film is probably the best film I have ever seen/felt it does the job 10-10",10
"You know, now that I think about it, I don't think there is more than one woman in this film.

This is interesting, because the fact is: this is a guy movie. This is the kind of movie a dad should watch with his son when he's having a hard time. This is the movie a guy would not be ashamed to feel emotional about.

It is the story of a man who goes to prison, but ends up coming out a better man because of his experiences. And it all ties together so nicely. The ending is especially touching, even as it moves from the main character (Robins) to the supporting character/narrator (Freeman). BY the way, the film was nominated for seven oscars and somehow didn't win any, which is a tragedy.

Every person in the world should see this film, even if you have to see it on TV, at least give it a shot, you will feel emotional at the end, but like the lead character, you will be better for it.

10/10",10
"First of all: this film is one of the ""must see"".

It's not just a collection of perfect moments. It's not just a work of good teammates. It's a single moment from the start till the begining when you live along with the characters of the film.

And the last but not the least: it very hard to make film after strong book. Different seasons is worth reading and definitely very impressive. When I watched the start I honestly doubted that it will impress me that strong.",10
"Though the prison system in the US may have changed by now under extreme ""political correctness"", but still ""seeing"" is believing. Twenty years are a long time, and the odds are against any one that plots an escape: the longer the time, the less believable an escape is. Perhaps the too neatly arranged escape hurt this movie's credibility, still the movie succeeded in being an entertaining window into a morbid world which may be too dark for the outside to see. If I agree with one thing in this movie, it is ""Never give up hope"", as Andy states it.",10
"Its understandable, I guess, to dislike this movie, but how can anyone truly hate this movie. There is nothing to hate. Anyways, did anyone notice in this movie that the warden aged a little, but the captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) did not. The story started in 1947 and ended in 1966. Did anyone notice this?

10/10",10
"It was a very awesome master peace movie, master peace.when i saw the movie i m literally fall in love with this master peace. Everyone need to see this master peace movie. If you watch this movie, you will definitely get a lesson in life. I never seen before that kind of master peace. I will definitely tell everyone to watch this movie once. It is a very good movie. This is the story of one man's life that seems to be the story of everyone's life. It will be my effort to make such a movie in my life. The joy of making such a master piece will be the greatest joy of my life.thank you so much...",10
"Weather the person liked the movie or found it one of there favourite movies, they still have to admit that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. There was so much symbolisim and moments that people will never forget that it will change the way they think what a good movie is.

From the crow being set free to a thunderstorm and all the way to each and everybody character, everything symbolized something in this movie. It isn't hard tofigure out what each and every one of them means though like Lord of the Flies and still makes you think even more then Lord of the Flies. To add on Lord of the Flies was boring and this left the viewer on the edge of there seat thoughout the whole movie.

Gasping, crying, laughing, heartbroken, thrilled are all some of the very emotions you'll feel in this movie then almost any other movie ever made. A connection to the characters can eaisly be made many times thoughout the movie and you simply want to goodguys to win, even if they arn't goodguys in society.

The acting was amazing and perfect. Freeman delivered each and every monologue perfectly and professionally and put up as great as a preformance, if not better, then the movie Se7en. Robbins put up his best preformance anybody will probibly ever see him in making us connect to him and leaving a mystery though half the movie weather he did shoot his wife or if he was innosent. The Warden (Gunton) reaches to one of the great movie villians I've seen and the other bad guy Byron (Brown) puts up a preformance almost as great as Sgt. Heart from Full Medal Jacket. Tommy Williams at first sight makes you seem like he's an elvis wannabe who seriously needs a life, but after time when Robbins starts to work with him you start to feel for him until your left in gasp at his last scene. Whitmore, who plays Brooks, has the viewer laughing, crying and screaming no at parts. The acting was perfect by all the major characters.

What could be perfect acting without perfect writing and perfect dialouge though? Stephen King wrote a masterpeice and it was written into perfect dialouge for this movie. Each and every monolouge was written to a masterpeice.

The directing was just perfect also, enough said.

To those that haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest to go see it a.s.a.p to know what a perfect movie is.",10
"Tim Robbins plays Andy, a young man framed for murder by an evil prison warden, who then gets Andy to juggle his crooked prison schemes and to do the wardens, and others, taxes for free. But Andy is an artist at heart, and despite the degradations of prison life, he fights the warden on behalf of his fellow prisoners, going so far as to broadcast opera to an entire compound of bemused uncomprehending criminal-types. But will he break out, leaving friends and carving hobbies behind? Obviously inspired by ""Cool Hand Luke"" with Robbins in the Newman role, Morgan Freeman as the George Kennedy top-con, and with the warden as the warden. Highly recommended.",10
"I wondered what IMDb people voted as the best movie of all times until one day I entered the video store and rented this disc called Shawshank Redemption.

I had the weird feeling that I already watched this movie before but splintered into different movies/TV series like humph the heroes and the villains, the acting all seemed so weird, is this deja vu? I am a young person so I didn't know how great this was until I went to the video store Morgan Freeman is so good, the way he narrated his story touched my hypothalamus- he wasn't crappy nor unconvincing or sounded underpaid nor overpaid-but-underqualified. He's great in what he do, acting.

The story's gradual exposure of Andy Dufresne's vulnerability was good and not the hurried type most story makers do to make the character big. He was mysterious and cool.

Great great great!!! I don't know but this inspired me in some way. Weird again right?",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film telling that a wealthy banker, who's been wrongly prisoned for many years for being suspected of murdering his own wife, finally takes his revenge and redemption with the HOPE that never dies in his heart and his wisdom. The story's based upon Stephen King's novel of the similar name. But there are certain amount of differences.

When it comes to the question ""why is it so excellent?"", some may say that it's got a so-called great story and unpredictable twist near the end, but I don't take it that way. The plot in my opinion is average in terms of complexity and twists. Actually the twist is predictable from the very start where the film itself already gave you an obvious hint. But in terms of developing and building up the characters, the story's magnificent, while it becomes more epic in this adaption due to the differences from the book. There're some scenes that shock the audience like deaths of certain characters, which didn't happen in the original book. These scenes not only helped render a more hopeless and crueler world than that in the novel, but also built up Andy's and Redd's strong personalities with no doubt.

The friendship between the two main characters is a highlight too. What's especially mentioning is that the film doesn't even have a single female character despite a very tiny one at the beginning, who didn't even say a word by the way... This separates it from other mindless Hollywood films which always tend to show women's charm totally. Friendship is the most cherished thing along with ""hope"" here in this story, and sometimes friendship pulls us back into form and faith when we're lost - so does this movie!

The acting and score are also beyond awesome, accompanied by well- arranged cinematography. Morgan Freeman's narration makes it even more special as it lets you see through the deeper thoughts of characters. At the meantime, the balance of emotion is well controlled so it never gets contrived.

Some people who don't like the film either say the idea it's trying to teach us is great but falls simple and obvious, or think the scenes like Mozart's music scene is exaggerating. But I think neither of them makes sense, because great films use extraordinary events to teach you something, and that's what we called emphasis. As for that music scene, people longly prisoned in a hopeless place can be easily touched by the things that we, normal people can get easily, since for them, it's not easy to get.

So, this is an honest film that doesn't pretend to be anything hard to understand while having its own depth, about friendship, hope and the spirit of never giving up when life gets tough. It's a must-see for everyone who loves great movies.",10
"This is surely in top 10 of the movies I've watched. I find almost unbelievable how people can put themselves together in jail and be even more productive than outside the jail, opposite of the expectations. This topic is really interesting, when people are left with nothing but communication with each other and it makes them stronger and give them hope to live the next day. Hope is good, as Andy would say... Filled with phrases to remember, it strongly contributes to the quality and impression of the movie. Robbins and Freeman fantastic, as always. I'm not surprised this is on top of IMDb ranking list, it's a masterpiece. I wouldn't feel sorry watching it several times, it's totally worth it.",10
"Feel good movie, that whilst harrowing, is a deeply rewarding watch. I do not subscribee to the Jesus/religious theories that I have seen bandied about. For me it is just a love stroy (bromance) between Red and Tim Robbins. A true analysis of how someone can be so compassionate, whilst having everything taken from them.",10
"This is how to make a movie. Excellent pacing, excellent acting and directing. Worth the entire run time.",10
"I watched this movie after a couple of years on television on our national broadcast station and I still remember the feeling when it was over. I was absolutely blown away. They did advertise it, but I wasn't really expecting much, maybe the low expectation is what made the impact so high, but I am still pleasantly surprised by the way this movie makes me feel every rewatch I do.

This movie is the story about two friends and how they cling on to hope to survive the dire circumstances that they are in and resisting being institutionalised.

The whole cast put in some stellar performances. The story is amazing. Even with it being set in a prison there are some amazing imagery. The score is amazing (I only picked up on some things after a few rewatches.)

This is my favourite movie of all time.",10
"Yeah, so it's a nice story (eventually) but it takes a long time getting there. Unbearably depressing for most of the movie.",10
From the mind of Steven King.. I wish I could argue that it shouldn't be IMBD #1 ranked move of all time but I can't .. A great story of perseverance. Perfectly cast and written.,10
"Currently this is the top rated movie on IMDb Top 250 -- and has been for many years -- and the reason is that this story can relate to everyone. That's not to say that, like Andy Dufresne, everyone was literally in prison, no, but in a quietly profound way it addresses a fundamental aspect of the human condition that everyone can relate to. Whether it's a housewife who's lived the same day for twenty years, or her workaholic husband who's also lived the same life for twenty years, it seems many people, judging by popularity of the film, consciously or unconsciously see this film as a metaphor for their own lives. Freedom is the issue here. Freedom from monotony, from despair, from death. Freedom to build boats or listen to Mozart or feel the sting of rain on your skin. What Andy Dufresne wanted was what we all want in our quiet moments, perhaps in the evening while we lie in bed, or in the rare instances when we have nothing to do and nothing to distract us. Andy Dufresne is us, magnified. The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie and that's what great movies do: they provide a mirror in which we can see ourselves.",10
"The suspense and surprise make this movie a Hollywood legend. It is awesome, the last 30 minutes are unbelievable. You can't catch what's coming. The acting performance by Morgan Freeman and his costars are incredible. This is a masterpiece.",10
"The reason I'd give this movie 10/10 is because of this brilliant character, Dufresne, who is a quiet and deep thinker. His pondering, resonating silence is felt through the film through Tim Robbins' amazing talent, and the viewer falls in love with him almost at once. The beautiful, well drawn out character is one of my strongest fictional role models.",10
"My story is like a lot of yours. My brother and father wanted to rent this movie at the video store, and that alone made me wary, plus in my teenage mind I was thinking ""What? I've never even heard of this movie!"" But after watching it I went to the store the very day it was released for home video and bought it.

Everytime I see this movie, it makes everything inside of me ache. I mean truly ache. From the very first scene I was hooked, and in each line of dialogue I experienced everything from tension, laughter, shock. It has a quiet aura about it, a heavy mood that is not necessarily somber, but instead incredibly profound.

I used the opera scene in my media class to demonstrate the core ideas of this movie and the entire class was transfixed. I think my favorite scene is Red and Andy talking after Andy's extensive time in ""the hole"". What they discussed: hope, freedom, his wife; it makes me want to cry.

Please don't let anything stop you from seeing this movie. It is for a teenage girl as much as it is for anyone. If it doesn't affect you, I'm not sure what will...",10
"I didn´t expect much from this film before I saw it. It had OK stars, the plot sounded pretty familiar and it was originally a Stephen King story. Once I started watching it I thought: ""Hey! This is pretty good!"". And it got better as it went along. The story was was a perfect mix of high drama and ""feelgood"" quality. It didn´t matter it was long and the story went along slowly. It was all build-up for the amazing ending which caught me by surprise. Somehow the film has a sense of being more than it seems at first, it´s really an epic story of one man´s determination against the system (or even his given destiny!). If you´ve never seen this film, go see it -you won´t be disappointed!",10
"Woow, what a movie, what a story! I have seen this 3 times, second time I was around 20 and I can say this movie has so much to say. Much more after 10 years I am almost 30. I have learned from this much, at least do not stop to sending letters... There is always hope. The only excuse that this did not win awards is the Forrest. Zihuatanejo.",10
"So far, no one's favorite movie! Plot and acting are all meant to be awesome! Insurmountable classic in the classic!",5
"Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free.Hope is a good thing, and maybe the best thing of all.",9
"There are so many movies in this world, there are those long epics like Gone With the Wind, there are those complicated stunning visuals like Inception, but of all the movies of all kinds the best is the simplest, pure film, The Shawshank Redemption is proof that the film doesn't have to have a four-hour runntime, it doesn't have to have a long and epic battle scene, it doesn't have to have a big budget, it doesn't have to have a big gross, he doesn't have to win an Oscar or have to be too complicated to be the best. Somewhere the best rated films are Citizen Kane, The Wizard of Oz, Mean Streets, etc. But I don't think there's really any doubt which one is the best. This film is a wonderful story about hope and friendship in the worst parts of life, about the harms of prison on the further continuation of life and really some people should not be imprisoned.

For this movie rating is 20/10!",10
A movie about hope. Where with the right effort and mind we can all have it. Even in a world where hope seems no where to be found.,1
"I thought I had never seen this movie before and then I happened upon it on TV. Then I realized I was required to see this movie in public school(in which I zoned out with boredom).

Basically it's a campy Forest Gump-like story of prison with the common tropes of rape and racism--but nothing like a real prison for most people--I mean who goes to prison and gets a cushy office job?

It's okay for a generic movie but as a prison story you will be left wanting.

In fact, here are a few reasons to see a different movie:

1 - The escape plan: It's silly and simple. Makes you think the prison was run by complete idiots. Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is much better.

2 - The final escape: pretty anti-climatic. Just finally happens and then movie is basically over. Once again, go see Escape from Alcatraz if you're expecting extensive tunneling/swimming or something that makes you feel like the prisoner earned their freedom.

3 - If you want a prison story about that best captures the essence of the desire to be free watch Papillon. It's roughly based on the French penal colony system during WW2 and numerous escape attempts.",10
"This movie depicts yes there is still ""Good"" present in this materialistic world. An incredible tale of Friendship/struggle/desprair and ultimately Achieving your goal.",10
The definition of a classic movie. The story is great and the acting as well. I've watched it so many times I can quote the whole thing.,8
"the movie shaw-shank redemption is amazing,it compels the audience with history and simple diary narration.it shows you what life is like from different point of views and has a simple storyline ""go to prison and die there"" but the people in the movie do not follow on with this line and are permanently being tested both by mental and physical assumptions plus every time they attempt to plea for freedom they are constantly being rejected and some prisoners (Andy dufrence) are actually Innocent and in prison every one is innocent but he is really innocent to many Innocent's the plot is simple Andy is attempting to break out by using the facilities shaw-shank prison has to offer e.g. he uses red his best friend to smuggle in necessary items axe posters and uses other people to help exceed his plans to break out of prison. all in all i honestly could not find Any faults with the movie and loved the story,i especially liked the narration and how each scene was related in a formal sense.

well i really recommend this old classic to be viewed and want to hear other views",6
"Best prison movie since The Great Escape. One of the most satisfying climaxes of any movie ever made. Morgan Freeman should have won the Oscar for best actor. Relative unknown Bob Gunton (one of those actors you see, but you never know his name) is also brilliantly despicable as Warden Samuel Norton. Like many classics, despite its modest box office appeal, Shawshank will grow in stature through the years and will be recognized as an all time great.",10
Awesome Movie. Great performances by the whole acting cast especially Freeman and Robbins. I thought the warden was an excellent played character also. The screenwriting was awesome. Too bad this movie was out the same time as Forrest Gump or perhaps it would of had way more accolades. Still one of the greatest movies ever.,10
"This is incredible movie script. There are many variations and learning things. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about hope, emotion, and friendship. The story tells about the unjust experiences in the protagonist's life and how he still battles them with hope and patience. The bond between the characters, Andy and Red, is remarkable. They make the movie an effortless watch. Oct 12, 2022. As such, it ends up being more likeable to people than movies like The Godfather, Seven Samurai, 2001, and others, even when those are much better.

IMDb ratings are by a lot of people who don't really care much for the actual quality of films. Maybe that isn't really fair.",10
"If you are from another planet, and you haven't seen this film yet, you will simply be blown away by it.

The first time I saw this film, by the end credits I already knew this was the best film I was ever likely to see.

There's not much more to say about it, except it is sheer drama at it's best, with a purely fantastic ending.

Robbins and Freeman put in performances they will never repeat.

Forrest Gump got the '94 best picture award ahead of this. Don't get me wrong, Forrest Gump is good, but does in no way compare to this

11/10.",10
"Superb acting and brilliant performances from Tim Robbins (Mystic River) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby), who play as inmates, Tim Robbins playing a man framed for the murder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. The two inmates develop a friendship over the twenty odd years spent in the prison.

This movie portrays an ugly, though bearable life in prison through the 40s, 50s, and 60s.

It's a strong piece on how far one will go to redeem himself, even if those things that must be redeemed are not by any means loathsome. See it if you haven't.",10
"The Drama like a real life example. Every character like live. Once we read as morning shows the day. When I see the trailer of this movie I think it is a normal movie. But when I advance after 6 minitues the character is going meritorious to meritorious. That's the major tragedy of this movie. I learn more things from the movie. My real life is quite match in this movie. I remembered those days when I see this. I remember by family life, my struggle life, my romance life. Time and tide wait for none this movie proof this. If your aim and concentration match with you then you should gainer. It is the main theme of this movie.",10
"I gave this film a 7 over all. I think it was very well filmed and acted, but perhaps that's my problem with it - there's the 'feeling' that you're watching something 'significant' but the aura it seems to generate seems out of line with the proportion and events of the story. But, then that's the magic of cinema, and it _did_ pull the wool over people's eyes (therefore the 9's and 10's in the poll).

I was especially impressed as I'm not a King fan (either on paper or any film/miniseries adaptations i've seen) and wasn't expecting much from this, but the narrative and characterisation are fairly strong (again, if out if sync with the film's ""feel"")",9
movie must watch shows how a man can survive in situation that is not in his favor. character in movie are well played and all those played it well it is ever green movie u may watch it right now still love it. it was recommended to me by friend i recommend you to watch it too good lesson in movie,10
Such a great movie. So many great characters and I love the bond between Red and Andy. Shows the trials and tribulations inmates face. And the twist towards the end is amazing. Excellent movie!,10
"I'm not giving a low rating because I'm against whats popular. Shawshank Redemption is a great film, its actually one my favorites. The characters are portrayed very well, except for Andy. I know he is supposed to be an emotionless socially awkward guy who only has one facial expression. In that case he played his role perfectly but I don't think its a wise choice to have a... main? Character like that? I'm not sure if Red was the main character, he is our eyes and ears so...

Either way the film shows cinematic genius and truly amazing story telling. I enjoyed every second of it, some say certain areas of the story dragged on too long but hey its prison. Every moment in prison is dragged along. But I don't know about being the greatest film on IMDb. I would say Citizen Kane should be number 1. Citizen Kane is so amazing its actually art. So again loved Shawshank Redemption and I wish more movies were like it, but I don't know about greatest film of all time.",6
"I love this movie for many reasons. The acting doesn't get any better. One gets easily pulled into the stories and characters with no hesitation. When a story can effortlessly make you care about the situations and troubles it presents, it deserves praise. This movie may not have a revolutionary plot, but it it still everything a good movie should be. One may think the ending is too ""touchy feely"" but i think it adds to the overall appeal ,remember it's not called the ""Shawshank Damnation"". See it and enjoy and remember, it's OK to to cry over happy things too!

Final Analysis: I will watch this movie many more times before I die",8
"Just two words for this movie - Simply Awesome.

This is the best movie ever made.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a powerful and moving film that tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a man who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sent to the Shawshank prison. Throughout the film, we see Andy's struggles to adjust to life in prison and his eventual friendship with fellow inmate Red. The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are outstanding, and the direction by Frank Darabont is masterful. The film is a triumph of storytelling, and it's no wonder it has become a classic and a favorite among audiences. I highly recommend ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to anyone looking for a powerful, emotionally charged film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",8
"It keeps you engaging throughout, it is a very emotional and old story, heartfelt story.",9
Lets me know i dont want to go to prison. he was innocent and ultimately got back at his captors. and he made a good friend.,10
"This is simply the definitive American film about the endurance of the human spirit.A wrongly convicted man spends twenty years in a brutal prison, never losing his hope for freedom. A beautifully written and directed film by frank Darabont.A true representation of what the art of film can be elevated to. One of the greatest films ever made.",10
"This masterpiece belongs in the company of The Godfather, and other films often mentioned reverently as the best of all time. I am not going to compare this film to the other finest made, as that is often difficult to do, how does one quantify what is the best, without shortchanging other films. Simply put, this is a timeless story, which encompasses the best elements of all films, suspense, horror, comedy, tragedy, and puts them together in a seamless tapestry, as rich and colorful as life itself. Superlatives fail to illustrate the quality of this work, as complete and satisfying a film that has ever been made.",10
"It is no wonder that the film has such a rating so brilliant it is quite literally awesome. What can I say about it yaa? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10 absolutely!",10
"The story is excellent and the actors all perform well. Never a boring scene. Good drama. Some scenes are even funny ! The plot is superb. I thought Stephen King only wrote horror-stories, but I guess I was wrong !

If you see this movie on video, sit down and watch it all and LISTEN ! You have to pay attention! And then you'll love it !",7
i really dont have any more to say - except read the other reviews - they really say it for me. In other words - this is one of the greatest movies of all time. This is an absolute masterpiece and it will be definitely a film that i will gladly show to my grandchildren in the mid-21st century - IT'S THAT GOOD... watch it and learn.....,10
It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving.,10
"This one is a winner. It was a sad movie... and unacceptable for young kids to watch but a real good movie.... I am a big fan of the two main actors.. Tim Robbins,, and Morgan Freeman. Does anyone know if this movie was based on a true story?

What a wonderful ending also... and as I said before in other comments, I love happy endings.",10
"I had never heard of this movie.I missed it when it came out in theatres.But fortunately it was my destiny not to miss it.It is amazing!It has absolutely no ""leaks"",no parts in the plotline where you say ""hey,something's wrong here"".Freeman and Robbins give an excellent performance. It is one of the very few Hollywood movies I've seen,which actually contains large quantities of drama and feeling.Don't miss this movie,cause if you do you've lost one of the best experiences of your life",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. The film stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover.

The film follows Andy's journey as he adjusts to life in prison and forms a friendship with a fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman), who acts as a mentor and father figure to Andy. Throughout the film, Andy and Red's relationship is tested as they both face challenges in the harsh prison environment.

What makes The Shawshank Redemption stand out is its powerful message of hope, redemption, and the unbreakable human spirit. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver exceptional performances, with Freeman's calm and wise Red providing a strong contrast to Robbins' portrayal of the determined and optimistic Andy. The film's cinematography is stunning, with shots of the towering stone walls and dark, dreary prison interiors creating a sense of hopelessness and despair.

The Shawshank Redemption is not just a prison movie; it is a movie about the human spirit, friendship, and the power of hope to sustain us in the darkest of times. It is a timeless classic that will leave a lasting impact on viewers long after the credits roll.

The Shawshank Redemption is a must-watch film for anyone looking for a heartwarming and inspiring movie experience. With its powerful message and exceptional performances, it is a film that will remain a classic for generations to come.

Lastly, the film's ending is a triumph of hope and redemption, leaving viewers with a sense of upliftment and inspiration. It is a true testament to the power of the human spirit to endure and overcome even the most difficult of circumstances. - By SEO Board.",10
"Old directing, cliched characters, bad dialogues,The main character tries to be perfect but goes towards vulgarity and unrealism,And it's longer than it's worth,not for me .....................................................",10
"Excellent must see movie about surging life behind bars battling whether it's the guards, prison mates, and/or even the warden with plenty of plot twists and narrated by one of the most well known voices, Morgan Freeman.",10
"A good film without love, without special effects. The film tells a very pure story, a redemption, a return to freedom, and a belief that drives him to do so. This film is touching, it also makes many people grow up.",10
"For a movie shot entirely in prison where there is no hope at all, shawshank redemption's main massage and purpose is to remind us of hope, that even in the darkest places hope exists, and only needs someone to find it. Combine this message with a brilliant screenplay, lovely characters and Martin freeman, and you get a movie that can teach you a lesson everytime you watch it. An all time Classic!!!",10
"The story is described by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the dividers of Shawshank Prison for quite a while and is its driving business visionary. He can get you whatever you require: cigarettes, confection, even a little shake pick like a beginner geologist may utilize. One day he and his kindred detainees watch the most recent busload of detainees empty, and they make wagers on who will cry amid their first night in jail, and who won't. Red wagers on a tall, slender person named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who resembles an innocent bystander.

In any case, Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he bet. Andy ends up being an amazement to everybody in Shawshank, in light of the fact that inside him is such an intense supply of assurance and quality that nothing appears to break him. Andy was a financier all things considered, and he's in for murder. He's clearly blameless, and there are a wide range of points of interest including his case, yet before long they go up against a sort of illusion; every one of that numbers inside jail is its own general public - who is solid, who is not - and the deliberate section of time.

Red is likewise a lifer. Now and again, measuring the decades, he goes up before the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and inquire as to whether he supposes he has been restored. Goodness, most without a doubt, yes, he answers; however the fire leaves his confirmations as the years walk past, and there is the feeling that he has been standardized - that, similar to another old lifer who murders himself in the wake of being paroled, he can no longer truly imagine life all things considered.",10
"One of, if not the best movie ever made. A classic that will last forever. If you have not yet seen this movie, do yourself a favor and BUY it, don't rent it. This is a movie you should own. I'm not a person who only likes certain genres of film. I watch all kinds of different films and this is at the top.",8
"After watching, I immediately had a question: ""Why didn't I see this movie earlier?"". Probably because I associated the title with some Chinese film starring Jackie Chan. Although the Chinese here and does not smell. This is an excellent drama about prison everyday life, about will, about hope, about striving and humility. After the action of the film is transferred to the walls of Shawshank, I completely immersed myself in this atmosphere. It seems like a long film, but the plot is so captivating that you even forget about time. Moreover, the escape itself goes to the n-th plane. Lots of bright scenes. For example, I really liked the moment when everyone froze when they heard the music. It looks like a trifle, but it looks amazing. I was hooked by the story of Brooks. I never thought about the fact that it is really very difficult for prisoners who have served such a long time in prison to adapt in freedom, if at all possible. I won't talk about the main character. I think that even without me this line was praised. I wouldn't have the will power to do something like that. And this is a reason for admiration. A great movie. You can, of course, find fault with some trifles, but you don't want to do it at all.",10
"I've heard alot of people say this movie is overrated, but none of them seem to remember to give a comparison. If this movie is undeserving of its status as one of the best movies ever, then what movie is better? I'd really like someone to supply an alternative so I could rip their choice apart and show them exactly why it's not as good.",10
Excellent stars and supporting actors make this a once-in-a-lifetime type movie. The script was so well written it made it seem as if everyone was actually inmates in Shawshank. Every time the movie comes on tv I watch it and at the end STILL cry of happiness. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are outstanding together!,10
"My friend and I have agreed that any man between the ages of 20-40 will have one or more of the following as being in their top 3 movies of all time : Star Wars, Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption.

A fantastic source novella, skilful direction, career performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman....the list goes on.

The plot can't be summarised easily - suffice to say that there are no car chases, no gunfights, and no actors from Dawson's Creek.

This movie is one of only three I can recall where I specifically noticed EVERY person leaving the cinema with a HUGE smile on their face.",10
"If it isn't perfection, it is the closest any movie has ever come.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a great and dramatic movie. It's acting, plot, and screenplay are extraordinary. The directing is very well done. This movie is one of the best pictures to come out of the Hollywood for a long time.

It mainly is about a man named Andy who goes to Shawshank for the murder of his wife. While he is there is meets this man named Red, who later becomes his best friend. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freedman were the perfect actors for their parts. They act very realistic.

While I read the short story by Stephen King which this movie is based on and I realized they got most of the stuff that was in the book on to the screen. This two hours that are spent very wisely. I suggest this movie to anyone is ready to watch a great film with a great ending.

Rated R What I think it should be rated and why: R for some violence and language.

***** out of 5",9
"A truly great film. Probably the best prison movie ever made. Even thought it's the only prison movie I've ever seen. Anyway, I think this movie deserves the rating it has on IMDB. Now to get Saving Private Ryan's rating up there. Okay I'll stay on topic. Morgan Freeman is at his very best in this movie playing the ""man who can get stuff for you"" or Red. Tim Robbins was also great as Andy Dufrense. Not only was the acting great, but so was the story. The message here was one that I will never forget. But I won't tell you what it is, you'll just have to watch the movie. 10/10. As I always say to all my favorite movies, great job.",10
"I Don't know how many times i have watched this movie and i know i will definitely watch it again,but this movie always inspire me whenever i lost my hope and got imprisoned by fear of failure and wrongdoings,it helps to conquer this premise.

i often thrown in to oblivion,whenever i have no idea about what to do, the one quote made me busy with my life is ""Get busy living or Get busy dying"". In fact,quotes from the movie stick to my desktop which could not be removed even by myself.

Furthermore,the climax of the movie made me shocked as well as concluded the bottom line ""Hope is a Good Thing"" which i still follow and forever.",10
"The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. Shawshank Redemption was my favorite movie when I first saw it, and I only realized its weakness later, this movie will look a lot worst the second time you watch it with its mysteries revealed and questions fully answered because one of the great qualities of this movie is its impossibility to guess which direction the story will take until it reaches the end. However, the movie celebrates the determination of the human spirit ""There's something inside you that they can't get to, that they can't touch. It's yours.",10
"This is an example of story telling at its very best.

If you experience this movie and not come away with thoughts about how you live your own life and how you may set things right even in a small way, then you are a rare person indeed.",10
"This is a great movie. The entire movie is filled with life changing themes that reveal how important integrity, friendship and hope is in this world. One person with a big heart can make such a difference. For being a simple drama without any real action, romance, or special effects, Shawshank Redemption does a phenomenal job of drawing in the viewer and creating intense scenes at every turn. The characters are vivid and easy to relate to. When so many movies today revolve around computer generated graphics, explosions, fight scenes, and sex, it is refreshing to watch a movie that reminds us all of what life is really about. Life sucks sometimes, but Andy looks past his circumstances in order to better the world he was forced into. The friendships he makes and the way in which Andy brightens up the world around him is inspirational.",10
"When I watch this movie, I am thinking of my life and the reason why we live. Wonderful.",10
"One of the finest films ever made, it has a storyline based on the power of friendship. The film is about Two imprisoned men and how they bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. It is a beautifully made film and credit should be given to director and writer Frank Darabont. The acting masterclass of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins helps create a heart-wrenching friendship as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) struggles to cope in Shawshank Prison as he has been wrongly accused for his wife's murder. In steps ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) a man who knows how to get things who befriends Andy and learns about his story. This is one of my all-time favourites and rightly so. It is one that everyone should watch, a film where grit and determination, mixed with true friendship, always helps you prevail in the most difficult of situations.",10
"This movie a generational masterpiece from start to finish. Acting, story, score, cinematography, cast ...all 10/10

It's a movie that will stand as IMDBs best and for good reason.",10
"An outstanding story ,with fantastic cast that is truly make this viewing experience unforgetable.",10
"A enjoyable movie, a dying trend in the 21st century, almost impossible to expect something of this caliber in today's world since hollywood's propaganda agenda overshadows majority movie projects.",9
"Love this movie. Great story, great actors, Shawshank Redemption has been in my top 5 favorite movies of all (my time), a long with The Green Mile. Never get tired of Shawshank.",9
"Top 250 material - YES #1 movie of all time - not a chance in Hell.

I saw this movie when I was like 14 or 15 and thought it was the greatest film ever made. Great acting, great story, great subplots, best Stephen King adaptation ever, Morgan Freeman.

The things that bother me most now are the one-dimensional characters of the warden and guards. If we could see what turned them from human beings into what they are now, that would have been helpful to the emotional atmosphere of the film. The warden was definitely one of the central characters and I didn't quite get a sense of who he was.

Still a fantastic film, but I can think of 100 better ones.",10
No need for comments.......it's just that good. From beginning till the end it's a true TRUE masterpiece.,10
"What a great movie, written by: Stephen King. Original title: Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. This movie has got 7 oscar nominations, but didn't get 1. I don't know why, because this was one of the best movies in 1994.

It's about a man Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is guilty on a double murder of his wife and her boyfriend.

In this whole movie you find out about his life and if he's guilty or not. Great acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. (10/10)",10
"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen, and it deserved all the Academy Awards it received. The only other movie that has made me experience so many different emotions during it's running time, has to have been ""Forrest Gump"". Because ""The Shawshank Redemption"" made me smile, it brought tears to my eyes, it made me laugh, and it made me curse at the injustice that takes place. And the acting-chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is nothing but excellent. Yep, this movie is great, and nothing but great! If you haven't seen it, you definetly should! And IF you HAVE seen it, you probably agree that it's a wonderful movie!",10
"How can someone not love this movie? Not only does Stephan King create the best plot and story line, but the actors such as Tim give the effect to make it a great. The story is perfect , its also honest. Morgan and Tim made the best pair of cons. And Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown made the best ""bad"" enforcement duo.

Complete 10/10 and a great movie for any collection.Although if something like a guy getting his head beat in by a night stick or some guy crawling through a sewage pipe up to his chin in crap , if stuff like that makes you a little sick , Id suggest pop a gravol and tuff it out princess its not that bad.",9
"This film ranks as one of my top 10 films of all time .

Superb performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins , they cast this film wonderfully , From the crafty warden , to the prison guards , to all the inmates , And what a terrific ending to a superb film .

This film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Forrest Gump , had it not been for Gump , this film would have surely won Best Picture.

I have watched this film 20 or so times and never get tired of it , No question it is the best Prison Film ever made ( Escape from Alcatraz close second ).",10
"I remember wanting to see this movie because I saw the promotional shot of Robbins standing in the rain; I thought it was a beautiful scene. It is a minor scene in the movie.

This movie is, for lack of a better word, perfect. Every moment holds meaning, every performance is dead on. I have watched it more times than I can count, and it always seems new and wonderful to me. More than any movie I have seen, it brings real emotions to the audience and brings comfort to the hopeless.

Sometimes I think a great work of art is one that brings change to the audience. This movie is transforming.",10
"It's tough to say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said. We all know that it's an amazing film, full of great horror, humor, and hope, that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic, and that the ending's one of the finest endings ever. There are just some notes I'd like to jot down.

 Have you ever noticed how easy it is to be ironic about difficult subjects? Have you ever noticed how being ironic about difficult subjects is frequently mistaken for edginess? Have you ever noticed how great and exceptional this movie is for *not* approaching its subject with irony?

 The plot to Shawshank isn't that amazing, but it's certainly nothing bad. Nobody enjoys Shawshank for the plot. The feeling one gets at the end and the characters are what makes this movie so powerful.

 I've heard some people grumble about how having the main villain being a Bible-thumper shines a bad light on people who frequently quote the Bible. I would argue that that's the case no more than Hannibal Lecter shines a bad light on intellectuals, and that if you quote the Bible in a fashion that reminds them of the Warden then you are doing something gravely wrong.",10
"7917 reviews and you are here reading this one. I will start with this one thing : this movie is much more than a must-watch, and you should stop everything that you are doing and watch it right now.Words are hard to find in order to describe it, so go watch the movie and see for yourself what reaction you will have.",10
"Nobody needs another review of how amazing this movie is but it needs to keep the top spot to encourage the younger audience to watch it someday. Morgan Freemans narration is so memorable that I can hear his voice in my head even though it has been more than 10 years since I watched it. I hear that beautiful music played around the prison like I'm listening to it right now. When I first saw it the tears streamed down my face at that part. You will understand when you see it. Hope, love, friendship is the message you come away from this movie with.",10
"It's a shame that The Shawshank Redemption was never as critically or commercially successful during it's run in theatres, as perhaps it should have been. If it were, then maybe the travesty of having Forrest Gump take the 1994 Best Picture Oscar could have been avoided, the award collected, instead, by either by this film or by Tarantino's groundbreaking Pulp Fiction, which were both stronger efforts. But I digress.

Beginning in 1946, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover. He's sentenced to serve two life terms back to back in Shawshank Prison, ruled with an iron fist by the Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the foul-mouthed, violent Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). Shawshank, Andy soon discovers, is a place of corruption and injustice, which begins at the Guards and stretches to the Warden himself, and includes a group of sodomites known as ""the Sisters"". Amidst this, Andy finds himself part of an unlikely group of friends, Red (Morgan Freeman), the ""man who knows how to get things"" and Brooks (James Whitmore), the good-natured, aging old-timer and librarian, among them. As we watch these men through the next 20 years of prison life, a tragic subplot develops with the Brooks character which deals with the nature of spending too long behind bars, and how, eventually, the bars and walls of prison can influence even a man of Brooks' good nature.

When a young convict arrives at Shawshank with proof that Andy is innocent, injustice at the prison rears it's ugly head. Andy is faced with a choice to make  ""get busy livin', or get busy dying""  and he does just that, propelling the film from that point forward into a rousing, uplifting climax which tests the bonds of friendship between himself and Red, and ultimately provides the audience with an important message about hope, salvation, and redemption.

Writer/director Darabont reclines in his role and lets Shawshank's modestly-paced, subdued screenplay flow through it's 142 minutes. The film achieves the rare state of never seeming to drag or feel rushed. There's no flashy action here; rather, Darabont allows his audience to be compelled by the dialogue and the array of terrific performances, from the assured conviction with which Robbins believes in his innocence, to the thoughtful grace of Freeman's Red.",8
"The level of the plot is clear, stable and smooth, the actors are full and three-dimensional, and any line can become a constant word. People with dreams have their own halo and always keep a distance from the chaotic world. At the same time, they are clear-minded, uncompromising, confident, and always have longings and hopes for a better future. Every time you read a classic, it is a process of soul purification. It is like a sweet wine with a mellow entrance and a long aftertaste.",10

"At that time, it was rare to be framed in prison to have faith and stay awake, because day-to-day work in prison really destroyed people's hopes. But the man is the one who is awake, and he redeems himself and others, Let other people's world t also more excellent color.",6
"This movie is amazing from beginning to end. It takes a really good movie for me to not check to see how much longer is left and that's what happened when I was watching The Shawshank Redemption. I accidentally moved my mouse and I saw I was already an hour into the movie when it felt like I just started. A must match in my opinion.

All the characters feel real. Its amazing how good everyones acting is. I genuinely felt like I was there with them watching their everyday life. There are a lot of lovable characters and a lot of ones you will hate. Each and every one has there place and you start to feel connected to some of them. Amazing story telling.",10
"There are few movies that have the ability to do what this movie can. I am writing this review after finishing watching this film again on TV. The deep character development of the two main characters gets you so invested into the film, that you feel as if you know them. Then as the film unfolds and is resolved you are taken up in your being and then right towards the end you are taken ""through"". A truly perfect film in cinema. The height of idealism in all its glory. A perfect example of the height of brilliant film making and artistic craftsmanship. A movie that will be in museums. If you are watching this for the first time, it will be an experience you will never forget.",10
"It's a great movie, No wonder why it got almost a full score. Morgan freeman was great, he made the whole movie to be quite honest, I kinda knew what to expect considering he's Morgan Freeman, but Tim Robbins did a great job as well, This movie was the only one I've seen him in and it's safe to say he didn't disappoint. 10/10 would watch again 100 times over.",8
Legendary film with very interesting redemption + power of friendship.,10
"Shawshank is an absolutely amazing film. Its concept is not especially compelling; you might even call it plain, but oh, the execution! Certainly this is how to make a movie.

I saw Shawshank in the cinema, which is always good, but not necessary for a film where the plot and filmatic skill are what draw you in. When I left, I noticed that everyone was sniffling. The film is so beautiful that even the tough people cried. I don't mean that it's a tearjerker either, it doesn't make you cry out of sadness or pull cheap stunts to get the tears flowing. Well, perhaps sadness has something to do with it, but it's a deeper kind of sadness, one that's got tears of joy in it too, not ""how could they kill the dog?"" sadness. And while it makes people cry, they're glad they saw it. It's not even my kind of movie, but there's no way I can give it less than a 10.

Notice that this movie is loved by all kinds of viewers. From the people who aren't so articulate to the movie snobs, this film hits home on a level that none other I know of does.",10
"I've seen the shawshank redemption upwards of 10 times and never get tired of it. Tim robbins delivers his best preformance as well as morgan freeman. The two play prison inmates who become friends and devise a plan to escape. After that alot of sad things happen to them rape, beatings, solitary confinement, etc. Morgan Freemans character is released while Tim Robbins succesfully escapes after bringing down the corupt warden and head guard. The acting is superb as well as every other aspect in the film. I highly recomend this film to any avid movie buff like myself.

8/10",10
"I have seen this movie now a couple of times and I can say that it is one the best movies ever made! It's not an ordinary movie, it's something special. Both Robbins and Freeman did an Outstanding role and that's one thing why I love this movie so much. This is timeless movie, one and only of a kind. This should be on everyones must see list! Superb..",10
"1994 seemed to be a landmark year for film. It produced Pulp Fiction which is undoubtedly one the greatest films of all time. Bloody, brutal and brilliant.

Unintentionally accompanied with Forrest Gump, a sweeping epic tale of a simpleton who is present at several of the biggest events the world has seen which is brilliant in capturing the audiences imagination and perhaps deservedly swept the Oscars. However, for me personally, The Shawshank Redemption, which is tied with Braveheart and The LOTR trilogy as my favourite films of all time , is simply unbeatable.

A towering, moving, simply first class story of a man, Andy Dufresne who is wrongly imprisoned for life in Shawshank penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her extra-marital lover. Lived by Tim Robbins, he struggles to adapt to the tough conditions in Shawshank assembled by Captain Hadley, the Sisters and the off-beat warden Norton. Clancy Brown is dark and effective in his role as Captain Hadley whom we love to hate and Bob Gunton produces a career performance as warden Norton whom we equally disdain, but for different reasons. Morgan Freeman is outstanding in his role as Ellis Boyd Redding known affectionately as 'Red.' We can thank the academy for failing to recognise his turn with the Award for Actor in a Leading Role that went to Tom Hanks, who can annoyingly sleep through a role and still find himself reeking of awards, money and positive publicity. I'm not saying that I didn't like him in Forrest Gump, no way, he was fantastic, I just think Freeman was a character we could sympathise and empathise with. That's just my humble opinion though.

It is the greatest story ever told on film in my opinion. Stephen King works can be very dodgy when transferred on to the big screen (Dreamcatcher) but Frank Darabont has done an astounding job in depicting the pain and suffering that the prisoners endure whilst in Shawshank. The screenplay is virtually flawless, great to see.

The film succeeds brilliantly in gauging Andy Dufresnes levels of comfortability in his surroundings and how he grows to become one of the most popular inmates.

To conclude, The Shawshank Redemption is a massively enjoyable film that comes well equipped with drama, intrigue, twists and a triumphant ending that is second to none. The cast, spear-headed by Robbins and Freeman are immensely impressive and the direction by Frank Darabont is unprecedentedly precise and pure. Whern you combine this with solid cinematography and a wonderfully crafted script, you have possibly the greatest film of all time! 10/10!",10
"I would simply regard this movie as the most enjoyable, re-watch- able, satisfying yet not without its own sadness movie of all time.

The small hints to philosophies and subtle humour is what makes it great every time you watch it.

This is a movie that everyone has to see. We in life deal with our own struggles and unfairness. While here we get the amazing effect that justice does happen with enough perseverance.

Freedom is a fundamental right to all people and atonement is to be found for crimes committed. There comes a point in all prisoners lives where they are truly sorry for their crimes. This is not the main line of this movie but the idea comes across very well. truth will come out and you may find a time where there will be honourable people listening to what we have to say, even if that honour comes out after a sentence is served.

Highly recommended for all ages. Any person can learn something from this.",10
"""Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most impressive and memorable productions in the history of cinema. Directed by Frank Darabont, this masterpiece is based on Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". In the movie starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the themes of hope, freedom and friendship are handled.

Coming to the plot of the movie, a young and successful banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is wrongfully sentenced to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. During this time, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and forges a strong bond of friendship. Thanks to Andy's wits and skills, he builds good relations with the prison warden and the guards, increasing his chances of survival. Throughout the film, the characters' difficulties and extraordinary events leave a deep impression on the audience.

In particular, the emotional narration and sincere candor of Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, have a strong influence on the film's audience. Also, Tim Robbins' performance is admirable. The harmony of the duo and the story of the impressive characters form the basis of the success of the film.

The technical aspects of the film also achieved great success. Thomas Newman's compositions and Roger Deakins' cinematography add to the atmosphere of the film. The realistic depiction of the Shawshank prison and the social structure of the USA of the time make the film more impressive.

As a result, ""Shawshank Redemption"" has an important place in the history of cinema with its strong acting performances, impressive storytelling and unforgettable scenes. This work should be accepted as a work of art that shows that people should not lose hope and how valuable the pursuit of freedom is. If you haven't watched it yet, I definitely recommend you take the time to experience this excellent movie.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time. It doesn't have high budget effects, dramatic car chases or elaborate plots. However it is a fantastic story of the inmates at Shawshank Prison, more specifically Andy Dufrasne (Tim Robbins) and 'Red' (Morgan Freeman). The reason I believe this film is the greatest is down to its ability to deliver a brilliant story at a realistic level, with developing friendships, loveable characters and despicable villians.

The tag line for this movie states that ""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"" and that is what this film is all about, hope. The belief that if you have a dream, hope can help you realise it, no matter how bleak the situation may seem. Everytime I watch this movie, I become immersed by it to a point where it seems that I am there with the main characters at each and every step. I watch the credits roll knowing that I have been touched by something beautiful, knowing that I have been told a tale that inspires any hopes and dreams of my own. The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the greatest movie of all time.",9
"This Movie is just as good as the Actors who perform in such a great Way. I felt like im in Shawshank myself, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins made this Movie so amazing. The Story behind it is even more impressive.",10
"'I wish that I could tell you that Andy fought the good fightand the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you thatbut prison is no fairy-tale world.' This quote nicely sums up The Shawshank Redemption, a film that earnestly shows the violent life in prison, but chooses not to focus on the violence, rather using it to portray emotion.

Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a successful banker, is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. The judge describes Andy as cold and sends him to the Shawshank prison to serve two life sentences. Andy, however, maintains his innocence, despite the fact that he was seen at the murder scene carrying a weapon.

In prison, Andy eventually gains the respect of his inmates, including the influential prisoner 'Red' (Morgan Freeman) who 'gets things' for the prisoners. Later, Andy's knowledge of finance gains him popularity with the cruel prison guards and the Warden (Bob Gunton).

The development of the friendship between Red and Andy is one of the focal points of the film as each man learns from the other. Several subplots are nicely intertwined into the film, none better than the story of old Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) and his release from prison. Having spent so much time at Shawshank, Brooks has become 'institutionalised' i.e. so attached to prison that he cannot cope in the outside world. The sense of helplessness and solitude Brooks feels when released is one of the films most genuinely emotional moments.

The plot of the movie is solid, and while it encompasses some 20 years, it transitions well and never really feels slow. Credit for this must go to screenwriter Frank Darabont who nicely adapts Stephen King's novel to the big screen.

The entire cast of the movie gives standout performances, led by Robbins. Robbins portrays Andy beautifully throughout the film, especially with his facial expressions. His eyes are incredibly focused and haunting throughout and he often wears a smile on his face that belies his situation. Freeman does well as Red, playing him with confidence and a sense of despair at the same time.

Visually the film opts for a very grey tone that fits in with the dreary feel of the prison and the prisoners. It also succeeds in helping Andy to stick out, as his hope and demeanour contradict the tone.

The Shawshank Redemption is a truly beautiful film, easily one of the best of the 90's, filled with a great story, acting, emotion and a series of memorable quotes.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an example of magical film-making at its best. When I say best, I really mean it. There are a lot of great films out there, and a lot that make me glad I saw them. But Shawshank is, above all of them, at the top of the list.

I love this film. Every time any part of it appears on TNT I stay to watch until the end. I just got the DVD on New Years Eve and watched the whole thing through until 12:34 am. It was the most enjoyable thing I could have watched that night.

Every part of the story is engrossing from the very first scene. The film has a way about itself that is uniquely its own. From the way it is shot to the musical score (a masterpiece by Thomas Newman).

Any film enthusiast, writer, storyteller, actor, or human being must watch this film. It is masterfully executed from one scene to the next, pristinely edited, and in so many words...perfect. I myself am a filmmaker and have hard time watching even great films without judging what I consider mistakes scene-by-scene. Shawshank pulls me out of that awareness and into a wonderful story and I have watched again and again. It never stops being great.

As a writer or storyteller I have the utmost respect for Mr. Daramont as well as Mr. King. The dialog throughout the film is understated and magnificent. There are more than half a dozen classic, memorable scenes that I consider iconic from this film. And to top it off, the performances from all the actors, specifically Mr. Freeman and Mr. Robbins, are timeless.

If you have not seen The Shawshank Redemption please make a point to make sure you do at some point soon. It is one of the best films ever made.",10
"It's the most impressing movie I've ever seen.I saw it coincidentally but was shocked very much by Tim and Morgan's acts.Especially at the end of the movie,I am aware of what is hope and how one can keep his mind alive.Is there anything more difficult for a single person to dig a hole through a wall in a jail within 19 years?We always consider it as one out of ten films that men have to see in his life(certainly it's on top).It's very pity that the Academy Reward neglected it,Tim should win all awards in 1994.Although few people have heard it before but if one is asked to see it ,he is surely very fond of it and thinks it is the best .I believe that Redemption will stay as long as I live on my mind.",10
"This film is excellent in all respects, in fact, this is one of the few films close to perfection starting from the actors, (The combination of Morgan Freeman (totally love him as an omniscient narrator who keeps us informed about the who's who) and Tim Robbins really give life to every scene visualized cleverly, the great script, based on the novel by Stephen King (the best novel of it, without doubt), the awesome soundtrack, excellent editing, everything fits perfectly. It has definitely the best narrative that leads to entertain and intrigue many times. What is so awesome about the story? It combines drama, comedy and thriller. The script is great, because it relates the stories of various characters during the whole film to reach a surprising ending, thus captivating the audience at all times. Anyway, Shawshank Redemption has it all. This film is one of those whose ending I failed to predict. The ending twist is really genius.",10
"The screenplay was Fantastic! There wasn't a single dull moment in the movie. Top-notch Performances from Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman paired with a riveting Background Score & Splendid Cinematography, made this movie the Masterpiece it is!

It is a movie that would be engraved in your heart once you finish watching it. The lessons it teaches us about life through its terrific dialogues are among the finest that Cinema has to offer. Shawshank Redemption is definitely among the Best Movies that I've watched in my life!",7
"I've gone back and rewatched this film after everyone rated it so highly. But I still can't see what the appeal is. It goes on and on but nothing much happens. Watching it started to feel like a prison sentence. I certainly won't be going back in for a third stretch. I'm happy to accept that I'm right and you lot are all wrong. To all those giving it a perfect score, I say try watching more films.",10
"I just rewatched this brilliant movie thinking seeing it a second time it would lose its impact. I was wrong. I was just as touched and amazed by this movie. This movie has everything a great film needs. From great story with a beautiful ending and fascinating characters, to great performances by every actor, to beautiful music and stunning cinematography. I could go on for ages why this movie is amazing. It doesn't have a single weak link in my opinion. Does it deserve to be #1? Maybe not. But it is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I enjoyed every single second of it. I would definitely recommend this movie.",10
"A truly magnificent film for any film fan. Its harsh reality of the criminal justice system in twentieth century America captivates your curiosity. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman two criminals convicted to remain in the confines of Shawshank for life. Both men emanate opposing ends of society, in that Tim is beaten savagely by prisoners learning that life in prison was bitter. Morgan Freeman recognises Tim's need to survive, striking up a friendship that eventually, with time, benefits other prisoners are left to rot. It's more than one man, but its the depiction of struggle and determination emanating from the film adaptation of Stephen King's story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'that anyone could be face in our lives.

A must see film that will change 160 minutes of your life.",10
This movie will change your life. A must see in 2020 to start out your next decade resolutions.,10
"There's not much to say about this movie. It's a cohesive, spectacular work of art. I don't know how long it takes for a movie of this quality and legacy to surface again, but I reckon it's going to take a while.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film for all to see in their lifetime. This is not just a movie about some men in prison, this is a movie that covers every life lesson!

Shawshank redemption is a powerful and special movie, that tells a story about 'hope' & friendship unlike any other - and I strongly believe this is by far one of the greatest films ever made!

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are complete stand outs in this film and have you engaged from the start until the very end.

This film's ending is also, in my opinion, one of - if not the greatest ending in film history! Always, always makes me cry! This film has many messages but one of my favourites is to make the most out of life - ""to get busy livin or get busy dyin.""

If you have not seen this movie, which myself and many, many others give a 10/10 and consider one of the best ever made, you must give this a watch.

Always remember ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things... and no good thing ever dies.""",10
The greatest movie of all time.... absolutely brilliant,10
"This movie stands out as one of the greatest of all times definitely. The story is highly captivating. Screenplay, cinematography are beyond beautiful. Perfection is the word for such a movie.",9
"Considering the time movie was shot, the acting, storyline and plot twists, this movie is a masterpiece.A must watch movie which will fulfill your expectations. Movie is 85% misery and 15% happiness. Dialogues are good. Background score hits at right place. Watch till the end.",10
"This is some Movie! Directed by Frank Darabont, The Shawshank Redemption shows more than any other film made about Prison life, the hopelessness, frustration, loneliness and degredation Prison inmates experience. Darabont does a great job in capturing the atmosphere of the Gaol, cleverly moving his cameras in close to magnify an emotion or expression as Andy Dufresne, ( Tim Robbins ) ' Red, ' played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, and many others including James Whitmore as the ' institutionalized ' Brooks Hatlen, wrestle daily with their torments and their tormentors. Robbins did some good work with his character,the snotty banker brought back down to earth in the form of a prison yard and, as always Freeman gave another polished performance as the prison's regular ' Sears and Roebuck ' while giving us also a moving narrative throughout the Movie. I particularly liked Director Darabont's wish to show us as much of the Prison as he can with wide shots adding another dimension to his work, and enjoyed also his ability to hold us all in suspense until the final scenes of the film when we see Dufresne finally gain his freedom with more than a little help from two lovely ladies, Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe and, of course.....his rock hammer. As always in Prison Movies full of good guys wrongly convicted or otherwise, there always seems to be a sadistic Warden or Captain of the Guards in the vicinity, eager to show just who is the boss, the end of a baton, or the door to solitary. Behind the Boss's door however was the biggest crook in the place.....Warden Norton. Bob Gunton does well portraying the twisted chief of Shawshank, it was a meaty role and, as it deserves gives great credence to a pivotal character. The Shawshank Redemption is a tremendous Movie, following a long line of films made about men behind bars....... this is the best one.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of my all time favorite movies. It tells the story about one man's journey through prison and his struggle to find a purpose in his life, in prison he meets a new good friend , Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully accused of viciously murdering his wife.

In a way this movie is two movies rapped up into one. It not only tells the unfortunate story of a normal man in prison, and what he does there. But it also is about a man rightfully accused of murder, and does his time in prison, we find he only committed this crime as a young, stupid kid, and is full of regret, he has become wise in prison and becomes rehabilitated for normal life, he is no longer a danger to society.

His struggle to be free and search for meaning in his life is his main passion. He is convinced that hope can destroy a man, hope is not a good thing. While Andy believes that hope is the only friend one can have in prison, in solitary, hope is the only way out. Andy acts as Red's mentor and guides him to the right way of thinking. This all leads up to Andy's need of Red, and finally one of the most moving endings in movie history.

Tim Robbins is excellent in the movie. He gives the performance of his life and plays Andy Dufresne to perfection. Morgan Freeman is also very good. It shows the ups and downs in Red's life, and the way of life for a prison inmate. While also showing the meaning of hope and how hope can keep a man's faith, and as a result, himself, alive. Don't miss this, you really need to see this movie several times to completely appreciate it. But even seeing it once is heart-warming enough.",10
"This movie was amazing in so many ways. Rarely do movies based on books do the book justice, but the movie was inanely accurate. The casting was flawless and the actors could not have done better. I don't think the phrase ""Brooks was here"" will ever leave my subconscious. Every character has so much depth to offer the viewer, it is an amazing look at the human race. Certainly not a movie to take light-heartedly.",10
When it comes to what really matters. This movies got it all. The cast of the two main characters is perfect. The whole cast makes a hell of a job. The music the story. This is my all time favorite movie.,10
"I have read the short story (novella?) by Steven King and seen this great film and I have to say that this is one time when Hollywood did a better job then the author. I've seen tons of prison movies (some with good plots and others that are complete B movies) and this has to be the best one out there. Usually when I like a movie, I can watch it a bunch of times. And I have seen Shawshank many times, but none of the repeated viewings were as good as the first. Clancy Brown (he was great in Highlander too) once again steals the show as a Hard A--- prison guard who gets his just desserts in the end. Chances are you've already seen this, but if you haven't, I fully recommend you give it a chance.",8
"To begin with, The story is pretty well cliched. Like most prison dramas hope and struggle seem to be the element that put the plot together. For once this is probably the one time that such a cliched plot actually worked. I have personally seen this movie over 20 times just to figure out how and why it works so well. First of all the story is deep and thought provoking. Morgan Freeman's voice over narrative lets you see it through his eyes (the movie is really about him). The acting is flawless the whole picture is shot as a true epic. This is one great film about friendship and hope that does not dwell to much on pathos and mindless sentimentality. A true modern day classic!",10
"This film is so beautiful and so touching I had problems seeing it without crying. Who knew Stephen King could write like this and the first film of Frank Darabont(later he directed The Green Mile)was to be one of the greatest films ever made. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are excellent in this movie and the way the story itself is told is pure genius.

It`s a brutal and violent film ,but still it`s the most beautiful and loving film I`ve ever seen. It`s a story about friendship and hope and the road to freedom.The greatest scene in the film is when Andy and his fellow-prisoners work at the roof,and Andy is nearly killed by captain Hadley, but ends up drinking beer in the morning sun with his friends ""like free men"".",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is different from any other movie in one most obvious way...there is nothing wrong with it. Tim Robbins is fantastic as the reserved and to some extent mysterious Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman's portrayal of 'Red' is just as good. Stephen King shows he is more than a horror guru by teaming up with Frank Darabont to produce one of the greatest movies of all time. There's humour, there's sadness, there's action, there's drama. This film has it all. 10/10. Shawshank is a fabulous tale and it is a shame that it won none of the Academy Awards it was nominated for. If you haven't experienced The Shawshank Redemption, stop what you doing, leave your house/office and go and either rent or buy this video. An absolute classic. The best. Darabont's work has been limited since this film but his last directing sensation was The Green Mile. Starring Tom Hanks, this too is a fabulous film and both feature in my Top 5 of all time. Watch them both.",2
"Many people ask the fatidic question: why does this movie is ranked second best movie of all time??? But I believe that most of them have miss the point: we don't love movie because its `cool' or because one is more `intellectual' or anything else; no, we love movie when they leave to us a powerful message. So yes, this movie is quit simple, the plot is basic, the actors are ok, but not exceptional but the image that stay in your mind at the end is a message of hope, it shows you that sometimes, in our life, our beliefs are more important than anything else; that we must choose the deepest way to succeed in what we expect to shine, because hope is the last thing to die.

10/10",10
"Hard to believe that Tim Robbins could be so good in such a serious role. As usual, Freeman is fantastic and the supporting cast was effective. The only imperfection to this great film is that it runs about 15 minutes too long. Not to say that the last several scenes were unnecessary, but certainly dragged, after the climax of the film had been achieved. Nonetheless, a great movie with a brilliant twist.",10
"A standard and appropriate movie but this film is boring and lacking any excitement ,the film process is very slow. Overall to me, it's a completely ordinary movie and with the expectation that I had this film (As one of the best film in the history of cinema) , it is far away . This film is much weaker than the one who wants to be named the best film of history!!!!",10
No matter how smart you are this movie will always be one step ahead of you. It depicts how the friendships should be. The movie will not disappoint you at all.,10
"Ah! What a film it was. For me, it explained freedom most precisely. And yes, it will surely let you know that only a man behind the bars can explain the freedom in best way (Dufresne and Red in this movie). It just changed my views towards life.",10
It is the only movie I have seen twice in my life.,10
"I have seen a lot of movies in my life but this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence.

The film stars Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Cinematography and Best Adapted Screenplay. It has since been included in the Library of Congress's National Film Registry and was ranked at No. 33 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list and at No. 67 on their 100 Years... 100 Thrills list.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the best prison movie, with interesting characters and a fairly realistic storyline.

Other prison shows such as Oz or Prison Break tend to be ridiculously far fetched.

The storyline spans about 20 years, with great narration by Morgan Freeman.

The Shawshank Redemption has a high value to watch many times. It's worth watching for sure.",10
"I don't think I need to tell you how good this movie is. Impossible to tell. Literally a masterpiece. A movie that deserves great praise. The final was really meaningful. Watch this movie I'm going to tell you, watch it over and over if you can.",10
Human emotions are captured well and presented as a beautiful movie. Friendship between Andy and Redding in the worst environment blossom beautifully and slowly. Both Andy and Redding won our 💕 through fantastic acting. When the innocent man detained wrongly by the system and how he responding back to the different situations and towards different people are portrayed very well. Scripts extraordinary. I have not seen any other movie at par with this movie so far.,1
"This film captures the isolation and despair of prison life better than any other film I have seen. Robbins and Freeman are absolutely amazing in their portrayal of friendship behind bars, and Stephen King's story adds a measure of justice to the grand finale. I really loved the short story by King and was afraid it would lose its compelling vision on screen. I was happy not to be disappointed.

I hope other films can captivate the morality of the characters and their condition as it plays out. Kudos also to the actors that played Brooks and the warden and his assistant.

The cinematography and the score are excellent as are the vignettes that appear throughout; in particular the music that Andy plays in the prison yard from a loudspeaker.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant, timeless story of a young man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted and imprisoned for the murder of his wife. While in prison, he befriends an older black man named Red (Morgan Freeman). This film masterpiece just takes you through the years Andy spends in prison, and the hope that human spirit can keep alive even in the most hopeless circumstances. Tim Robbins exhibits a quality in this film that is inexplicable but charming. You really fall in love with his character and I genuinly believe (Robbins) acting in this film is perhaps one of the most moving performances ever caught on film. This really pushed me to respect the cast and really open my eyes to their acting abilities. This truimphant tale will leave a bittersweet trail through your heart as it did mine. ****",10
"I didn't read all of these reviews, but I believe that nothing much is rest to be said. When you see the number you may ask yourself: what can I say and not to copy the words of other people? But when you watch this movie over and over again, one thought never leaves you: being a little, what ever it means mustn't stop you to grow and to know who do you really are. Others may not recognize your work, maturing or growth, according to this film. If nobody sees it, doesn't mean it's not worth. Awareness might be hidden, and you just have to believe and hope. In while you are living your ""boring, unhappy and unfulfilled"" life, trying your best to survive, 'till the moment you wait so long. When you achieve that, you need to imagine unwritten ""Shawshank redemption 2"" in which the main character (maybe you) is hardly trying to find another reason to survive present ""peaceful and quite"" time. So, you haven't got excuse not to watch this movie and to exclude yourself from the large group of people, only because it's large. Don't be unique in not watching it, but in revealing some other side of it and solving the mystery of your own life. I am joining to the group of people who simple love it.",10
"Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I say—the greatest film ever made. But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great ""greatest movie"" debate. The serious nature of its central plot points—a wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escape—is contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this film—no special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom. Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the ""greatest film of all time"" because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.",10
"Before seeing this movie i was not so profound of Hollywood movies.I prefer,like anyone else in the world to see movies in my own mother tongue.I didn't even know what the title was.I am happy that i was patient enough to check this movie.This movie by all means is philosophical and brilliant.Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman chemistry was just brilliant.screenplay was so good.I always say to my friends ""movies,songs,dialogue that keep lingering in our mind"" are the ones which we feel for it.I felt more than that after seeing this movie.I spoke about it to everyone as much as i could.If you are patient enough you will get to understand it better.I watched it a number of times still after the end of the movie i feel extremely confident every time.

I am disappointed that this particular movie didn't fetch a single Oscar.But as more people see this they will understood that good movie doesn't require any accolade.Truly a stunning movie! My favorite movie also.....10/10",10
"A Prison Movie. An all-male cast (except for Rita Hayworth). Violence. A title guaranteed to sprain your jaw. When Shawshank hit theatres in 1994, odds were decidedly against it becoming a huge success. It would be nice to think that an ultimately upbeat, earnest, modernist take on the films of Frank Capra would immediately find a sympathetic and appreciative audience. But that would be a fairy tale, and life, like prison, is no fairy tale.

The film has the cheek to ask Which is worse, being a murderer, or being a lousy husband? Certainly the audience must ask itself this of the main character, Andy, played by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 for the murder of his wife and her lover. Introverted, bookish, proud, his fate is uncertain until he attracts the attention of the prison ""finder"" Red, played by Morgan Freeman. Together the two men must find emotional healing, spiritual redemption, and hope, if they are to survive.

Adroit and expertly manipulative, the film's pace is dictated by the deathless narration of Freeman, who could hold an audience spellbound while reciting phone book listings; or, suspend utter disbelief at a patently preposterous storyline. Nor are characterizations any less preposterous, from the sociopathic Warden, to the sadistic Head Guard, to the grandfatherly Librarian, to the manic-youthful Young Punk. But if the characters seem too archetypal to be true, it is a necessary, and tolerable evil in this fairy-tale set in a prison.

As I said, life is no fairy-tale, and prison movies rarely get to top-ten status. But sometimes some good does prevail, and redemption often stands in wait for those who dare reach out to it. As a first-run cinematic release Shawshank was not a great success. But as a commercial video, the film has achieved high status, and is voted year after year as a top consumer favorite. Cinematically near-perfect, visually breathtaking, Shawshank is a state-of-the-art example of the power of film to tell stories, and is rightly considered a must-see by most film reviewers.",10
"Suphie W. 9/13/2012

The Shawshank Redemption Movie Review Though I haven't seen this film since the year of 2004, (it came out in 1994), I seriously remember being moved by it. I remember, quite vividly and with a pleasant vibe, how moved my friend and I genuinely felt when we first watched it together. These were in the days when Blockbuster was still around and when it was more monetarily feasible as well as logical to go out to your local movie store and rent a movie to watch with your friend; this was, with all due respect, before the current and giant economic melt-down that we are all experiencing. So, to set the scene and mood of the period in which we watched this film for the first time, the candles were lit, and my friend and I were seated eating gummy bears, and we stayed up and watched that sucker into the wee hours of the morning, cat-sitting. The economy was better, then, for sure, we all know, but, we were having a hell of a time (now my friend is away, teaching English abroad, in Korea, soon to retire there, though; she's had enough of it, as the lifestyle and the culture were just generally getting on her nerves, and she felt she had achieved what she wanted). Well, basically, the Shawshank Redemption is all about solitary confinement in a small, insulated, but high-security prison in middle-to-Southern Ohio, set in the '50s. Morgan Freeman and his white counterpart in the film (race was a factor back then), partner up to give each other moral support and courage during a very tough time for them both. The part that struck me most about this film, though, was that Tim Robbins, or, the character played by Tim Robbins, was put into solitary confinement, where food was shoved in his little cell in an unsanitary manner, and he was treated, as the proverb or saying goes, like a dog; and where he couldn't see nor hear from anyone for a long, long time; it was verifiable torture. In addition, Morgan Freeman, who plays someone who is, like Tim Robbins, on the death row, plays your average cool-cat gentleman who was convicted for the murdering of his wife or something, but who claims he didn't do it. There are many cafeteria scenes where the two bond joyously over their own jokes and jiving, and where they eventually become better friends. Basically, the two bond over their common suffering, and help each other through their sorrow. Indeed, Bob Gunton also plays in the film, a man who plays the jail-owner, or something. He appears, in real life, to be much older than either Robbins or Freeman, born in October of 1959, and 1937, respectively. Robbins notably graduated with honors from the drama program of UCLA in 1981, then went on to do other great things, such as forming the Actor's Gang Theatre Group, which expressed radical political views as seen through a European lens. In addition, Robbins has received many dramatic awards, and continues to do sporadic work in film. Freeman, of course, is the mighty train who continues to do well in whatever he does, and is well-liked by all, really. Bob Gunton has a tendency for playing strict, militaristic, authoritarian roles when it comes to his film-work, and he plays the role in the notable movie of The Shawshank Redemption. There are several intense scenes in the movie, The Shawshank Redemption, and many of them include the showing of the intense pain of both Freeman and Robbins, as they elude their grief. Robbins, in particular can't take the pain of being ""locked-up"" so to speak and often shouts, screams intensely out of frustration with having no one to talk to, and out of mental and emotional pain. Morgan Freeman notably cries, which is all the more pitiful as one sees his weary countenance.",10
"The performances by Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red are nothing short of remarkable. They bring depth and nuance to their characters and their chemistry is undeniable. The writing is supernatural, and the story is both engaging and emotionally charged. The film is expertly directed, and every shot and scene is crafted with precision and care. The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and moving film that stays with you long after you've watched it. It's a timeless masterpiece that should be watched by everyone. The film's themes of hope, friendship, and perseverance are universal and resonate deeply with audiences. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves great cinema. It's a true classic that continues to stand the test of time.",10
"Although a long film, and for the most part not light hearted, I am able to watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"" again and again and to this day I can't find fault with it. It was a brave film to make because if it hadn't been made and acted so well, some parts could have been very tacky. One thing I like about the film is the way in which it shows the convicts to be normal people who have made mistakes, not monsters. It emphasised how everybody deserves rights, even if they are in prison. It is an emotional rollercoaster for me making my heart break or swell with happiness. That sounds tacky, but it's not if you've seen the film.",10
"When I've seen this movie, I had just one movie with a 10-rating and didn't believe this could beat it (in my opinion). However, when the credits started, I knew why this is on the top: People have large expectations on ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and also their all-time favourite movies, but it seems it can touch nearly every person deeply. I really love this masterpiece from the beginning to the end, but I don't think it's perfect, the beginning is a little bit too violent and mostly I don't like erotic scenes (because it seems like the movie wants a cheap upgrade). This is just nitpicking and doesn't change the fantastic atmosphere, characters, soundtracks, story and all the deep messages behind it.

10/10",10
"Of a lifetime worth forty years- I never saw a movie that impressed me like this. You may not call it a perfect story but this movie just moves your soul...no wonder..it is the highly rated movie in IMDb. Two reasons why I loved this movie. Firstly the silence of Tim Robbins and the euphoria around Morgan Freeman. The scene on the terrace where Tim Robbins proves his mettle is a reminder of our latent abilities. This movie also reminds of survival instincts in real life wherein we should not lose hope when it comes to making choices. Two other movies that I loved in this perspective were ""Cast Away"" and ""Catch me if you can""!!! Not sure if they were all based on real life incidents but if you ever happen to live a life,make a movie,write a book... Do it this way!!! Amen!!!!",9
"With thousands of reviews already, the only thing I can add is that I'd always put off sitting down to watch this film. But after watching it, I really can't fathom why. The reviews and ratings obviously make this a great flick and the cast alone is enough to warrant a look for virtually everyone. Yet, I seem to have always found something else to watch instead and I'm kind of regretting doing so.

Long story short, if you've waited longer than me to check this out. Put the phone down and press play. You won't be disappointed.",8
"JUST WOW. this is possibly the best film i have ever seen and the best cast. Its beautifully screen played thr the chemistry between the two is just amazing.

GO WATCH.",10
"Best Of Best... Everyone in this film were so natural. I enjoyed every second of this movie..... Movie deals Humour,Tragedy, Hope, Friendship. #MustWatchMovie",10
"Omg, i enjoyed every bit of this movie.... How precisely they have managed..... Everyone was So Naturally Acted.",10
"Where to begin with the shawshank redemption, well first off it's my all time favourite movie and has been since the first time I saw it. The compelling story of friendship and redemption follows Andy Dufresne being sentenced to two life sentences for a crime he did not commit as he forms a beautiful friendship with Red, played by Morgan Freeman. The acting from the ensemble cast is extraordinary, With career defining performances from Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, brown and Sadler. The story is beautiful and always brings a tear of joy to my eye, mainly due to the incredible music composed by Thomas Newman. If you haven't watched the shawshank redemption, watch it. You will love it and ""that's God's honest truth"" overall a feel good masterpiece that is number 1 on IMDb's 250 greatest movies for good reason. Because it's the greatest film I have ever seen.",10
"A good movie about hope that shows the persistence of a falsely accused man. Tim Robbins does a good job at Andy Dufresne, but I think that without Morgan Freeman as Red (Ellis Boyd Redding), this movie would not be the same. I read the book, novella, whatever you want to call it, and it was different for the better, and there are multiple inside jokes/references to the book. The imagination of Stephen King formed into a movie that is hard to find something as good. A great movie about Hope.",10
"This is the best movie that I have ever seen! Shawshank spent unbelievable twenty years digging his way to the freedom which is pretty impressive. He took advantage of his special skills to gain the trust of warden and captain. I almost burst to cry when I saw he and his friends drinking most delicious beer on the roof with wind breezing softly. He could never be bent, even though his enemies kept attacking him. I really wished he could be free with the help of that boy. However, the warden would exploit him to death and wouldn't ever let Shawshank go free. If the truth was that Shawshank was innocent, then the warden would rewrite the truth to keep Shawshank around him and working. After all his efforts, I was very happy to see Shawshank had another beautiful and decent life!",10
"Shawshank IS a very good film but it has too many cliché characters and situations AND script holes that one can drive a truck through. Gee, this must be from a Stephen King story. Actually, it's from two of his short stories. With King its often quantity and not quality. Despite that, The Shawshank Redemption is worthwhile.

What this film does have is terrific performances from the entire cast and a sense that an honest man can remain honest, despite the worst of circumstances. The scenes with the great character actor James Whitmore, especially those of his trying to cope after his release, are very well done.

The last ten minutes is splendid and almost redeems the rest of the picture. It gives this film an 8 instead of a 6 in my scale.",7
The best movie ever made people think that the end makes it an incredible movie but it's not because of the end it is how Red and Andy build chemistry together it's one of the best movies about hope. This is my favourite film of all time and it should be everybody's favourite film I don't know how Forrest Gump won best picture over this nobody praises Forrest Gump anymore but people still praise the shawahank redemption because it's that good so yeah I would highly recommend this film you will not regret the it.,10
This is the greateast film of all time it should have won 7 Oscars not get nominated for 7 it will never be forgotten for years and years,10
"When I read Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption from Lord King I thought, WOW that story has to be brought to the Big Screen. When Frank Darabond realized his Vision I couldn't believe my eyes. It was more than perfect. Everything about this flick is pure perfection. Love it and always will...",10
"No matter how divisive the Internet community, there is one thing that everyone seems to agree on: ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the greatest movie of all time. What Writer/Director Frank Darabont achieved was commendable: he took a very good short story by Stephen King and turned it into an even better film masterpiece. The fact that this was Darabont's debut as a director makes it all the more impressive.

What is there there say about this movie that hasn't already been said?

The screenplay to this movie is pure genius, featuring some of the best character development of all time. Most movies have the hero and the villain be complete opposites of eachother, this movie does something different. In this movie, the most interesting character dynamic is between the two heroes, who are both equally inspiring but diametrically opposed. The fact that Darabont managed to pull off this difficult character arc is amazing. The acting too is incredible and adds weight to the genius of what Darabont wrote. This is the movie that made Morgan Freeman famous for narration and rightfully so. Pretty much all of this is done to perfection: the music, the cinematography, the production design...it's all incredible.

It's difficult to imagine if there's anyone who hasn't seen this movie. It is often considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time, and I wholeheartedly share this opinion. It's an amazing cinematic experience.",8
"Being #1 on the list I expected a lot, and it kind falls short of 10/10 in my eyes. Its a great movie but i expected more.",10
"Considering the fact that The Shawshank Redemption is #1 on IMDb, and also considering that it has been drooled upon by so many people over the years, I had high hopes. I've seen it a few times now, I first saw it when I was 13. No issues with the storytelling or character development, but just not as perfect as people say. Still a magnificent film!",10
"This is one of my all time favourite films. As it is for loads of people. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances, as well as the other cast members. The characters are also very likeable, thanks to said actors. Now this film has little to no action, but it doesn't need it, everything else in the film is just as interesting, so my mind doesn't wander. The film is emotional when it needs to be, it's funny when it needs to be and it's always entertaining.",10
"I groaned when there was nothing on TV that day so I decided to do the Pay-Per-View thing and pick a random movie. So I saw Shawshank, never having heard a word about it, merely because I liked Morgan Freeman. I was glued to the screen for those two and a half hours. Stephen King created one of the most poignant tales of hope in a modern era, Frank Darabont made every scene breathtakingly beautiful, and the cast was superb.

Shawshank definitely has the most satisfying ending in all of movie history. Although your first watch is the greatest, every viewing reveals a different layer of the story. You begin to see prison through the eyes of Red, Brooks, Haywood, Tommy - even Warden Norton and Byron Hadley.

It is my favorite movie and it has some of the most inspirational lines in it. ""Some birds aren't meant to be caged, their feathers are far too bright...""

Please see this movie. It is wonderful.",10
"There is not much to say about this movie. Shawshank has it all. Good characters, story, and acting. It is not my favorite movie, but is probably the greatest movie ever made. Watching this movie made me think what life is really like. I was moved by every minute of the movie and when it was done.... I almost thought it was real life.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are brilliant. You couldn't ask for anyone better for the part. Their acting in this movie made you cry and changed the turn for the movie industry.

This movie is worth every second, so don't miss ""The Shawshank Redemption"".",10
"Don't get me wrong i think the movie is good. but it's not great i mean there were much better movies in 1994 ""Ed Wood"", ""Heavenly Cratures"", ""Pulp Fiction"", etc. i mean there is nothing special about this movie it's very conventional..... i give it *** 0ut of *****",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films which will stick with you for the rest of your life. You'll always remember it, think of it fondly, and smile when you think of the best parts of the film. Many films come and go in your memory (will you honestly look back at a film like Armageddon and think of it in the same light? I hope not), but this is one which has become great, and will become greater with time.

Everyone knows the story, so I will save time relating that to you, but I will say that the story has many levels to it, which are not as obvious to some viewers. The multitude of characters which the story gives us all have meaning and consequences to the two central characters, Andy and Red. (Think about the references to/theme of birds). All the characters are a pleasure to watch, and come to life by the actors. However, the actors inhabit their roles so well, its hard to see them in different roles now.

Tim Robbins was unfortunate not to be nominated for any other award than the screen actors guild award, because he brought such weight and balance to the film, where Morgan Freeman had the slightly more showy role, bringing dignity and honesty to it. I think any nomination or award for either of the actors should have been shared.

Frank Darabont is a talented director who has a good eye for what looks good on screen, has a way with his actors to produce the best out of them, understands how to tell a good story, and is likely to produce fine pieces of work in the future.

I have always loved this film, and the story is just one which warms the heart and blood just thinking about it.",10
"Aside from the iconic poster-on-the-wall scene, nothing about this movie is all that memorable.",10
"This ranks right up with my favorite movies of all time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances in this movie. It kind of annoys me that this movie won no award. It should have swept the Oscars and the Academy Awards. Still this movie should be seen again and again. It is one of those movies that just won't get tiring and maybe it might just attract fans in the new century. I give it a ten out of ten!

Trust me go see this movie!!!!",1
Best movie ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is probably the most widely loved movie in all of Western culture. It's fleshed out characters give it the uncanny ability to deeply touch most of the people who watch it. We relate to Freeman's character who has lost hope in society. Robbins' is the friend who redeems us and gives hope back. Gunton, who plays Warden Norton, is one of the most overlooked villains of all time. He makes the greatest villain because he is the most realistic and relatable. He isn't a crazy murderer, he is a corrupt religious official. I believe this movie gets better when you have already seen it and know what happens. Seeing the wardern get what's coming to him is consistently satisfying. And of course, the famous beach scene leaves me on a high every time. 11/10",5
"No much to say here. This movie I great. It can be a bit boring because they are always inside the prison, it's quite routine. The story is magnificent though.

Definitely worth watching.",10
"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one.",10
"I don't know what else to say. The classics in the classics, the top in the top, are more shocking and moving on the screen. The emperor's position is perfect, and everything is perfect!",10
"""There is a bird whose every feather on its wing glows with freedom."" This line gave me too much moved and shocked, let me see after a long time can not forget. In my opinion, the key to whether a book or a movie is good or not is whether there is a moment in it that touches you. No matter whether it is a plot, a sentence or a scene, as long as it touches you and reminds you of it no matter how long it has been, then it will be successful.",10
"Teaches us a lot to never give up our hopes. We are alive coz our hopes are also alive. Each of the actors are best at their position. First 90 minutes seem slow but ends well. Very well.

Tremendous & Marvelous.",10
"Subtle and wonderful story. Excellent acting, A tribute to humanity, struggle and tenacity.",9
Best movie The thing i want to say is that with 2.3 million ratings it stands 9.3 and 1st film,10
"Shawshank Redemption is a film about prison life and how it changes people that live there. We follow a banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and how he tries to get used to his new reality. The movie has very good narration(classic Morgan Freeman Style). Some scenes are brutal but Frank Darabont used them right, he was not trying to shock the audience but to give what being lockedup really means. The movie shows you how strong routine is and how after being in prison for so long makes it more difficult to live outside than inside. Prison is about free time and times that you try to feel free through some small victories. Personally I believe that Shawshank Redemption succeeds in its purpose but it gave all the answers at the end and I didn't liked that, I wanted to find some of my own. I wanted to let me think if hope is really dangerous or not. Shawshank Redemption is a great movie and I advise anyone to see it, its definitely a classic.",10
"I don't care what anybody says about this movie, it is simply great. I watched it for the first time, on a bootleg screener copy, back in early 1995. I used to get the Academy screeners, and I'd be so excited that I was getting movies that were still in theaters, that I'd watch some I normally wouldn't. Shawshank was one of those. Not the type of movie I would rush to see, but my family had watched it, so I gave it a shot. I fell in love with this movie after the very first viewing. It's one of those rare movies that seems to get better, each and every time you watch it. When I see it on TV, which is quite often, I find that it's hard to turn the channel. It's such a human movie. Just about everyone can relate to something in this film. If you can't appreciate a film like this, I truly feel sorry for you. This is what film-making is all about.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption isn't nothing over special and that is the biggest power of this movie. It doesn't have any unnatural things in it. It is beatiful story in a prison. You get to know these amazing people and the hardships of prison.

Must watch movie, always.",10
"Despite being a very long movie, and not very action packed for that matter, I found 'The Shawshank Redemption' one of the most entertaining motion pictures I have ever stumbled upon. And I think that the entertainment value a certain film may hold is largely over-looked among film critics, and most people who watch films with a critical eye. But I hold it as probably the single most important feature in movies in most cases. And by entertainment value I do not only mean how it feels when you are watching the movie, but also the picture it leaves on your mind that makes you want to see it again, and that you can look back at and actually experience the feeling you gain from actually watching the film. And this is where 'Shawshank' really shines. The 2 hours just went by, and left me with a really good feeling after wards for some time.

But the other features should not be ignored either in any case. I really like the way 'Shawshank' makes you think. For me, it was mostly about how good I actually have it, and about life in general. It really made me want to better my ways in all sorts of ways. But unfortunately it wont last forever, but that's why it's good you can see the movie again. And when you do, it will still have the same impact on you as it did the first time around.",10
"TOP MOVIE, BEST MOVIE EVER MADE. They don't make movies like this one anymore. it's kinda sad.",10
"The story opens with a non intelligent man who is committed to make a crime, in the mid of 19th century. The story is furnished with the solid voice of Mr.Morgan Freeman who narrates the story throughout the movie. Though the story has a very slow pace which makes it a bit boring, it has a fine twist in the end which clears all the memory of that boring bit , to turn in an interesting end. The concept of the movies which works out to be a backbone of the story is that the prominence of intelligence along with the persistent effort which brings success to any man. The Director Mr. Frank brings out three interesting characters Boyd,Andy and Brooks who contrasts each other in their approach to life. Brooks in spite of the spending nearly half of his life in prison fails to make an identity of his own,while Andy tries to make his identity by giving some risks, while the Boyd plays safe to join the winner. The resources were available to all the prisoners at equal band, but the approach of each individual made a difference. The library project, and chess pawns carving symbolizes the way the Andy was creative. Brooks had already lost his ""hope"" in life(Symbolized by crow liberated by the way he is liberated from the prison). Andy always believing in himself and Boyd neither there nor here with both the intentions. The effort of twenty years of Andy gets him the victory the way he expected causing enough damage to the one who dominated him (Norton) for twenty years. The director clearly conveys the message ""Hope is a good thing and Good thing never dies"". His judgment cometh and that right soon.",10
"I was inspired to see Shawshank Redemption because of its ranking as second best movie of all time on this site, and a lot of people told me it was a brilliant film.I have to say I was a bit baffled after viewing this movie.It is certainly a good, entertaining, well-cast and acted film, but it is not anything special. I have seen quite a few prison drama movies like it. The brilliant performances and well paced story do set it apart from other similar works but still this does not explain how on earth Shawshank Redemption can be classified as one of the all time best cinematic achievements.

So I just want to caution anyone who thinks they will see something incredibly unique and magnificent. Without a doubt this art piece is very touching, however I found myself having forgotten about it a couple of hours after I had seen it. Not a sign of a masterpiece...

See the godfather, casablanca, american beauty, donnie darko, memento, moulin rouge for a truly breathtaking experience.

See Shawshank Redemption if you want to see a quality film.Definitely not a waste of a couple of hours!",10
"Frank Darabont has created a good film about the misuse of criminal justice system and the obnoxious corruption in prisons. He has done this by showing an insider's view of a penitentiary from the perspective of its inmates. Although Tim Robbins has a good role in this film as Andy,he is surpassed by Red played by Morgan Freeman. He is at the summit of his acting prowess as everything is written on his face. There is no other actor in Hollywood or elsewhere who could have done this role of Red with absolute conviction as Morgan Freeman. Shawshank Redeption tells us in clear terms that in prisons it is the rule of everyman for himself but sometimes there are exceptions. Feelings of suffering,sadness,trust,joy,companionship occur which give the prisoners the hope to carry on. It is nice that there is not much focus on feminine characters as they did not have anything that could have justified their presence.",10
"When Portland banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is unjustly convicted of murder and sent to prison, he quickly learns that life on the inside is harsh and unforgiving. Thankfully, he also forges a powerful friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) a fellow lifer who learns to appreciate Andy's spirit and determination. Later, when Andy set's himself up as the resident financial adviser to the warden and guards, he manages to earn an odd form of respect from all he comes in contact with. Based on the Stephen King novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", it is story about friendship, hope and the triumph of the human spirit over incredible hardship.

Hows that for a clichéd synopsis? This may summarize what the film is about, but it does not explain why this film resonates so much with audiences worldwide.

Now, I remember the first time I read this short story by Stephen King. I opened up ""Different Seasons"" because I wanted to read ""The Body"", the novella which is the basis for ""Stand By Me"". After I had finished that one I saw this oddly titled story at the beginning of the anthology. I started reading it and did not stop till later that day, when, with tears in my eyes, I put the book down. My first thought was ""that was a great story!"" and I was amazed that King could write something so inspirational. Then I thought to myself ""that would make a great picture"".

A year or so later - this film was released, and I went to the theater with high hopes. The memories of this story were still cemented in my imagination (I had actually pictured William Sadler as Red when I read the book) and I was not disappointed by what I saw. In fact, If anything I was even more impressed with the film because Darabont managed to capture the nuance and feel of the original story so perfectly. The look and feel of the prison and the characterizations of Red and Andy where inspired. Nobody carries the regal dignity and wisdom of Red like Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins was perfectly enigmatic as Dufresne. Add to that Thomas Newmans stoic and moving score, and what I saw was nothing short of movie magic. I walked out of the theater, my heart soaring and knowing I had just watched a great picture. I have only felt that way a few times before or since (""Field of Dreams"" and ""Dances With Wolves"" are two good examples) and I still get that feeling when I watch it at home.

This is more than a prison escape movie - it is, to me, a film about the friendship between Red and Andy. I think so many men are fans of this picture because Andy and Red have a connection that we would all like to have with our friends, and that only a few of us are fortunate enough to share or experience. I went to a marriage retreat recently, and when the men and women were split up and asked to describe their likes and dislikes, the question of movies came up. I think it is interesting to note that all of us men listed this film as one of our top ten.

King has a way of writing language that is both common and lyrical at the same time, and his characters have a wisdom and moral certainty that connects with the reader. Kings skill as a writer is especially evident in this picture with Freemans' narration. A lot of the lines which he spoke are direct from the book, and this is a testament to Darabont's respect for that written word. The screenplay he wrote was more than just a faithful adaptation - it is an homage to the wonderful story King wrote.

I have read a lot of reviews and comments on this site that refer to this film as ""over-hyped"" and ""cliched"", and to some extent this may be true. This movie doesn't have a plot thats overly complicated, and the characters (specifically the warden and prison guards) may be slightly two-dimensional - but I think that was done on purpose. I believe Stephen King wrote this story as an example of how a simple concept like ""hope"" can pull someone through a very difficult time - and it is this idea that appeals to so many people. This movie doesn't make any social commentary, and it is certainly not PC - which is refreshing. Too many films today are nothing more than political soapboxes for the film-maker, and unfortunately the cynics and idealists prefer that sort of commentary to simple story-telling.

It has been said by fans of this movie, that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was pooh-poohed by critics when it was released as sentimental tripe - and if the same film had been made today, it would be similarly scoffed and mocked with abandon for it's old-fashioned sensibilities. Now, people look at it as a classic, and rightly so, because it has a simple message that people love to hear, over and over. That's what ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is like. It's just a great story about friendship that is told well, and most people appreciate that and that is why its one of the top ten films on this website.

""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""",10
This is amazing movie.I have watch it 16th time.This is the best movie i ever seen in my life.,10
"Along with Forrest Gump, this is my #1 movie of all time.

This is a painful movie to watch... but just like Forrest's mom told him when she was dying of cancer, ""Pain if a part of life, Forrest."" I believe there's value in feeling the pain this movie emits to its viewer.

No one else in the world could have played the role or ""Red"" better than Morgan Freeman; indeed, he was born to play this role, period. His performance was simply off the hook, and largely what ""made"" this movie.

The ending of the movie is a real tear-jerker, yet so satisfying, leaving the viewer with such a nice, warm comfortable feeling. So, in a sense, you have a sad, gut-wrenching movie that actually has a happy ending.

This movie was perfect.

-Tracy Milburn",10
"All I can say is that some people have to do their research. This film is absolutely backwards and does not reflect reality. It was clearly written by someone who has no idea how the prison system works.

The protagonist of this film, played drearily by the effortlessly dumb-founded Tim Robbins, is a white man. Not only this, many of his strangely old convict buddies are white. He is even raped by a white man who he attempts to deter with a mop; he's not a puddle Robbins, you bloody idiot!

What the filmmakers clearly don't understand is that in reality, all prisoners are black and I'm NOT being racist, these are just facts. It's not because they commit more crimes, it is purely white privilege gone mad as no-one will accept them into their prisons and it is truly saddening to see so much money spunked out on another film attempting to hide this institutionalised love of these creamy coloured pussies.

This is just another film in a long line of prison propaganda trying to brainwash us into thinking that white people commit crimes. Take Cool Hand Luke for example: as if anyone would convict Paul Newman. No! They'd be too busy trying to dive head first into his slacks to get a suckle of his lean member.

At least Morgan Freeman is in the film, an allusion to the reality that Frank Darabont will not recognise for fear of being ostracised by the White High Council.

Unfortunately, this is not enough to salvage this film and so I can only give it 2 stars out of 10. One for each true fact portrayed in the film. One, that there are black people in prisons and, two, that Tim Robbins would totally get raped in prison.

THIS IS ALL A JOKE. THANK YOU FOR READING.",10
"Growing up reading Stephen King I thought Stand By Me was going to be best film made from his pages. While Shawshank is a little different than King's vision, the cast (outstanding) and timing in this movie make it a masterpiece 2nd only to the Godfather",10
"Never a film had given such a direct meaning to freedom, not a physical freedom but the one that dwells in the human soul. With this masterpiece seems the director, Frank Darabont, wants to prove Seneca's thesis. Seneca, in fact, argued that a man can be free on the throne or in chains. Though the role was firstly offered to other actors (Kevin Costner, Tom Hanks and Brad Pitt), Tim Robbins's Dufresne is extraordinarily expressive. The script is well adapted from the Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, and though Red was supposed to be Irish I forgive Darabont because he gave to the whole world the opportunity to see an amazing Morgan Freeman. I'm actually disappointed this film didn't won any of the seven Academy Awards nomination received (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing).",10
"One of the best movies I have watched till date.

A must watch for people of every age and gender.

You just don't know the whole time has passed.

You will not be able to miss even a single moment of the movie.

Best Screenplay One of the best acting I have seen in movies.

Storyline is just WOW

I do want to see this movie in theater if it is again shown on multiplexes.

This kind of movie remind you that you do not need VFX to make a good movie.

This movie is just the magic of the writers, actors and all others without much need of any high tech gadget that will add up the cost.

Really Awesome",10
"This movie has an extremely capable artists with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.

By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.

The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.

10/10",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made. Apart from a small number of nitpicks, this film is flawless. If you haven't seen this film, you need to. This film represents how good Hollywood can get and has set the bar very, very high. Not a single frame of film is wasted, every aspect of this film is important, it is just perfect.",3
"It's a masterpiece because after 29 years I have watched this for first time and it make me feels like a current time movie in which I didn't feel bored at any time.

The story was so engaging that you'll keep stuck at the screen till the end of the movie.

The character which Tim Robbins has played is one of the smart character till I have seen ever. He has the most important power thet makes him to conclude his goal, without giving a hint to anyone, that is patience. Also he has told that Hope is not the good thing but the best thing a person has which can give you unbelievable power.

Morgan Freeman has done a fantastic job also the main supporting character of the story. He has proved that he was the best friend of Andy because he kept his promise at the end.

The climax of the movie is so satisfying and smooth that you'll feel like you're watching that live from the beach.

Overall Shawshank Redemption is a all time watch masterpiece which will be praise after next 50 or 100 Years also.",10
"Great movie, good story and character building. Great cast, alot if greats here.

The story is so good and keeps you wanting to watch. It's a definite must watch. Great build good the whole way.

Worth every bit of 10. Masterpiece, just go watch it. You won't be disappointed",10
Best movie I've seen so far. Definitely a classic that will always persist as such.,10
"I remember watching this film as a teenager, under the open sky in an outdoors film screening. No film has ever produced a greater impression on me than that viewing of the Shawshank Redemption - so atmospheric, gruesome and triumphant it was.

The story catches the viewed by surprise and on immediately becomes highly sympathetic with the main character played by Andy Dufresne. You just can't believe how wrong the life is treating him until... He did have to meet someone to reflect his perseverance and to motivate him for taking the redemption. This is the masterful Morgan Freeman. The ending, though a long way to hope, brings hope and just makes you watch it again. Enjoy!",10
Nice movie and you need to remain patient with the slow start. You will have an urge to watch out again.,10

This is the best movie I've seen. It has a nice context. I understand that the overall rating should be above 9.5. Or people have to come and tell me that there are better movies than this. Recently when it was shot it is even better than the newer movies of today. It's a pity that we don't have such good actors in the film world anymore. Starring these two legends is already champions league level. People I definitely recommend this movie!!! I envy the people who are going to watch this for the first time. How I enjoyed it.... Haven't seen a better movie yet.. I totally understand why this movie is number 1.,1
"When the VOICE of the Century - ""Morgan Freeman"" is narrating a feel good story, that digs out all the hidden emotions inside of you, you only wonder, WOULD HOLLYWOOD Ever make a movie like this again !!!",8
"The summary must sound cliché, but this truly provides as a sleeping giant of a spectacle. Originally shown to my class at school, we tried to postpone this movie by nagging the teacher and ended up watching a movie we started only for slight show. We saw 'The Crow (1994)' and really didn't care much for this film. However, from the opening scene to the closing of the picture, The Shawshank Redemption captured us all and never let our attention away. I had to watch this a few more times with friends and relatives out of school especially with some disruptive kids talking and what-not, but I still couldn't take my mind off the fact that I underestimated this film so much.

If you want someone to watch this movie, then don't make it seem so great. It will take away from watching it by driving the expectations of that person far too high. Possibly the reason this isn't a perfect ten for everyone. Others didn't want to see this movie high in rating or are too pompous to score it high or are just too dense to change the rating from '1' to the actual rating deserved accordingly.

This movie has a quirky name that sounds almost biblical and cast and even Frank Darabont knew this could cause a problem. However, for whoever watches it, the quirky name throws him or her off guard and then pulls him or her into the movie unlike ever possible. This isn't a blockbuster; this is a magnificent film with an outstanding script and incredible and unusual cast. I'm writing this assuming everyone who has read this saw the movie already, and if you haven't... ""it's alright"".",10
"I'm a fan of King's work. And I confess that, when I first saw the Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption, I didn't like it very much. After I heard the coming adaptation in 1994, I thought to myself ""It's gonna be a cliche prison movie"". But when I first watched it on the big screen, I was totally shocked. I think they made a great favor to Forrest Gump and Tom Hanks that year. The 6 academy awards was meant to be for this film. I still get the same excitement while watching this one over and over again. Now I'm waiting for the DVD version for the film. And I also like to see a special edition for this one....",1
"The Shawshank Redemption came out better on screen than it was in print. Brilliant performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and a stellar supporting cast leaves a lasting imprint on the viewer. With a superb score and dynamic lighting and sets, this movie should be THE example by which other movies compare to and work by.

THUMBS WAY UP!",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece that takes us on a profound journey of pain, patience, and redemption. It is a compelling exploration of the human spirit's resilience in the face of adversity.

The film beautifully illustrates how patience can be a powerful tool for survival and transformation. It serves as a reminder that hope can thrive even in the darkest corners and that sometimes, freedom is a state of mind.

The redemption in the movie is multifaceted. It's not just about physical freedom, but also about finding hope in despair, friendship in loneliness, and dignity in degradation. The story is not just about Andy's redemption but also about the redemption of those around him. His influence on his fellow inmates is transformative. He instills hope in them, whether by helping someone to get his high school equivalency or by building a library to educate the inmates.

In conclusion, it's is more than just a movie; it's an experience that takes viewers on a profound journey of pain, patience, and redemption. It serves as a timeless reminder of the indomitable human spirit and the transformative power of hope.",9
"When i saw this movie on imdb as the highest rated, i thought what's so good about this movie, now i know.

"i read novels ...a lot..& i have never come across a movie (based on a novel)which could even equal the book version ...that is...until this movie came along. My God! what a movie..i dare even say that it was better than the book...novellette actually.Hats off to the movie makers. Andy is a classic case of 'never judge a book by it's color'. Morgan freeman in his best ever role...he can really play those all-knowing-incharge types. When i got to know how Andy escaped,...it was the shocker of a life time.Not even in my wildest dreams could i have done what Andy had done to escape. The warden was thoroughly chilling with his alum effected mouth. 'the sisters' were a real good throw-in...spice to the brew. A thoroughly enjoyable movie with more turns than a twister. Watch this one first, then watch something else.",9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time, leaving an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this 1994 film is a triumph of storytelling, acting, and direction.

Set within the grim confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film follows the journey of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongfully convicted of murder, and his unlikely friendship with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). Their dynamic forms the emotional core of the film, with Robbins and Freeman delivering performances that are nothing short of extraordinary. Robbins' portrayal of the stoic, enigmatic Andy is nuanced and compelling, while Freeman's narration provides a soulful and poignant backdrop to the narrative.

Darabont's direction is impeccable, capturing the bleakness of prison life juxtaposed with moments of hope and camaraderie. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the viewer to become fully immersed in the characters' lives and the prison environment. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is evocative, with its muted tones and striking compositions, effectively conveying the emotional weight of the story.

What sets ""The Shawshank Redemption"" apart is its profound exploration of themes such as redemption, friendship, and the enduring human spirit. It reminds us that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is room for hope and transformation. The film's climax is a tour de force, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's soul.

The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the authoritarian Warden Norton and William Sadler as the tragic Heywood, deliver performances that add depth to the narrative. The screenplay, also penned by Darabont, is a testament to his skill in adapting King's work, capturing its essence while infusing it with his own vision.

Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score complements the film perfectly, underscoring the emotional resonance of each scene. The use of music is restrained, allowing the performances and storytelling to take center stage.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film that transcends its genre, leaving an enduring impact on audiences worldwide. It's a testament to the power of cinema to move, inspire, and provoke introspection. A true classic, it continues to be celebrated and cherished, reminding us of the enduring power of hope and the possibility of redemption. This film is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the art of storytelling at its finest.",10
Incredible story. Incredible message. Incredible acting. Incredible score. This movie encompasses everything that makes movies great. You won't finish this movie without feeling every emotion possible.,10
"What else is there to say about this movie? Every single element is great from the direction all the way down to the score, which accents every moment fantastically. And then there's the acting, which I cannot praise enough for everyone's excellent portrayal. There is not a single moment in the movie which I felt an element to be untrue to how the characters would actually be all the way to the extras which is an extremely rare achievement. But the thing that makes this so great is that for some reason it never seems to get old no matter how much I watch it, in fact, it even gets better and better because I realize how much of a gem this really is. If you are one of the few not to have viewed this, please do yourself a favor and watch one of the most incredible movies of our time.",10
"Probably the only film a blind man can enjoy, Morgan freeman's lines should be made into and audio book. People hate narrators in films which yes can get annoying but this is one of those examples that work, that's all I have to say.",10
Ten outta ten. Couldn't create a better movie if you tried.,3
No words to say....... Unforgettable. One of the greatest movie of all time.,10
"I loved the plot in this movie. Throughout this movie i felt like i was Andy. I wasn't watching Andy, i was Andy. And Morgan freeman was my best friend. This only says that the acting was superb. This movie is always on TV and though i don't think i have watched the whole thing one time through, i have seen all of it in different parts at least 30 times, and each time i long that i haven't seen the movie from start to finish. So i recommend all to buy it, as its something i need to go out and do myself. Mordan Freeman is one of the greatest actors of all time and after seeing this movie, you will believe so. This movie is defiantly in my top 5 list. The only movies i would say have better acting is the first to god fathers.",8
"It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another.",10
"It's a movie about hope,freedom and friendship, that's what we need.",9
"I think I love this movie so much because everything completely works for me. I love the story of keeping hope alive in the midst of despair. I love the characters and the ways they decide to change. I love Thomas Newman's music with all my heart. I see so much of myself in Andy, it's crazy.

This is a movie that feels like everything had to land just right in order for it to be lauded the way it is today. Just the right actors, just the right director, just the right cinematographer, just the right music, just the right script... It all combines into this beautiful whole. It's a movie that doesn't seem like it would be all that special, and yet, it is so full of emotion and thoughtfulness and meaning that it speaks to people everywhere of all different backgrounds and experiences. It touches souls.

I watched this for the first time in August 2019, and I was instantly in love. I thought about it nearly every day in some way or another. And when COVID came around and flipped my life upside down, somehow, this was the movie that kept me going. I'd only seen it once, but it had lit a fire in my heart that no darkness could overwhelm. No matter how difficult things got, all I had to do was remember how it felt to watch this movie the first time, and suddenly, things wouldn't seem so suffocating. Just knowing that The Shawshank Redemption existed was enough to keep me going.

I love it, I love it, I love it.",10
"Where do I begin? The plot is ingenious, the actors put on a great show, and the themes of hope, friendship, and freedom resonate with all. A white man, Andy, goes to prison for a crime he didn't commit, befriends a black convict, faces a corrupt prison system that threatens his chance to be free again, and relies on hope, friendship, and his wit to endure his sentence and outsmart the system.",10
"So is this the best of all time? For me personally no, but its def in the top 20, and I think this is probably true for most people. It is the most consistent highly rated movie, that's why it is the best. The friendship between the two main chars is the star of the movie. You will probably like this movie regardless of what age you are or your typical movie preference. Pretty awesome writing. This also shows that you don't need to spend 200m to make a good quality film, just get a good story, good actors and good screen writing. There is a huge trend in Hollywood now that you gotta spend huge to get a good return, they can learn a lot from The ShawShank Redemption",10
"First of all I honestly don't know how to write a review for this movie. This didn't even feel like a movie for me it was so connected and just idk with time it makes u think omg what did I just watch, it is so beautiful.

It is quite literally breathtaking.is no wonder that the film has such a high rating,. The story, the acting but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. So satisfying and still the voice over of Morgan Freeman is in my ears. Story of a hope,life, friendship and overcoming hardships and at the end it's so satisfying.

There is a reason why this has high ratings. You need to watch it, it's amazing.",9
"Before Shawshank, the only good adaptations were of Misery and Stand By Me.

I'm sure I'm not the first person, nor will I be the last, to claim this is one of the best films ever made. One reliable indicator of this is a film's position on IMDb. As of now, it ranks third, but it has the potential to be number one. Given that we already agree that the movie is fantastic, I won't bother with the usual effusive praise. And if I may add, Stephen King's pen was what really piqued my interest in Shawshank.

In today's fast-paced digital world, whiteboard drawing has become a very useful way to communicate. This interesting method uses hand-drawn images and pictures to make complicated ideas and concepts easier for people of all backgrounds to understand and remember.",10
"Its...... its....... So Good. So Good. The Plot, The Twist, The Characters, The Antagonists, The Movie. Has a very special place in my heart. DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER. It has the major spoiler.",7
This should deserve more collections ... don't know why it was flop.,10
"It was about 11 years old when the first time I saw this movie. For a primary school child, a movie without superheroes or obvious villains but full of prisoners and complicated dialogues, was really a challenge. Even I already can enjoy some 'borings' said by other children. In fact, after that try, I didn't remember well about why Andy was put in Shawshank and how he broke out of that place, ether the reason why that young punk get shoot. And some other important scenes.

But still, till the next time I saw it in high school, and before many other times in the future, I do had some scenes can share with. For me, the hope itself maybe this movie wants to tell is not so impressive. But the bird can not be caged, the Italian lady's song, and of course, the beer on the roof. These scenes are so impressive, that I believe they effected my taste on movies, forever. It maybe the first time I finally understood that movie is an art, and it do have some thing you can not say by words, draw by pen, or read in a book. The Shawshank helped me to be a man who can really get into the palace of movies, and fall in love with it.",10
"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has been hyped about for as long as since it came out. I was aware it was a great movie but to experience it is another, great experience.

Andy Dufresne, a young New England banker has been accused of the murder of his wife and her lover, Mr. Quentin. He is given two life sentences to serve at Shawshank State Prison. Andy learns how to get about his new life and serves through some tough experiences like being the sexual delight of a homosexual inmate. Despite this, he meets Ellis or also known as Red. Their friendship goes beyond simple friends. Their insecurities and their desire for hope is what is what makes the great, great ending to the story. It's inspiring and also extremely entertaining.

The movie, although a modern masterpiece, may not be suitable for children who aren't in their teens due to some prison elements. Around 12 with parental guidance should be fine. Parents, once your kids are this age or older, this movie will have them talking about the values of life for a long time.",10
"G: Interesting themes and highlights the prison system in the US

C: Despite being fairly long, I didn't get bored so it's decent in my books, interesting to see Andy's life inside the prison.",10
"I just can't find a single flaw with this movie. It's so perfect. The acting is fantastic, the character development is superb, the plot and script is incredible. I bought the DVD and never get tired of watching it. This movie truly belongs among the greats, such as The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and Schindler's List, and this is the only movie I would place above the others in this elite group. There is no single element that makes it such a fantastic movie; the combination of every aspect of the movie being executed perfectly makes it great. A true masterpiece.",10
"This movie is one of the best movies ever made. I remember when i was watching it. I was feeling during the movie every emotion that you can imagine. The cast, well you know the cast... they play their roles with outstanding performance. The movie has some moments of awesomeness. Its great. Its perfect. Scenes, photography, scenario, plot, things that keeps your attention with intensity (and its not an action film), it has everything. I recommend it without hesitation. An excellent masterpiece that surely will be remembered as one of the greatest films ever. If you haven't watched this one yet, do it. Stop reading this review and go watch that movie!",10
"What an amazing movie. The performances, even by the bit players, are fantastic, the story is wonderful, the mood is great...this is about as close as you can get to a perfect film. The fact that Steven King wrote it makes it all the more amazing.

Although one might be tempted to think of this as a prison movie, it's not; it's about hope and redemption. The hope is embodied in Tim Robbins' character (Andy); the redemption in Morgan Freeman, Red (whose redemption comes as a result of Andy's hope).",10
"This movie really gives hope in one's life when a man has lost everything in life. Freedom is luxurious but again to enjoy that freedom hope is needed. Its full of life lessons. Wowww what a movie. Story telling, the plots and the cast. Even in 2021 this movie looks fresh. Its one of its kind.",10
"Therecare a lot of movies where plot takes place in a prison, with 'innocent' in-mates, cruel warden and a breathtaking escape but I'm almost sure that the director wanted to pay tribute to Bogart& Bacall's Dark Passage. There are some particular elements in the plot that resemble the 50 years old film such as; the ending scene on a south American Pacific beach (here Mexico then it was Peru), a bus ride thru the Mexican border, an innocent fugitive etc. (Morgan Feeeman of course is not Bacall...ha ha ).The rest of the story, or better to say almost all of it is an entirely different . Tim Robins and M.F work together with harmony , even pouring some humor into the gloomy atmosphere of the Shawshank prison.",8
"It is incredible how Frank Darabont, in his first direction, was able to create a masterpiece of such stature as this marvelous film (masterfully written by Darabont himself). The ingredients of this success were, of course, also the formidable cast (Robbins and Freeman) and a wonderful soundtrack by Thomas Newman. The film underlines the benign and compassionate nature of humanity after all, telling the story with great clarity and with remarkable dramatic tension. Some say we are facing the best film of all time. I am not very convinced of this, but undoubtedly, in my opinion, it occupies a deserved place in the shortlist of the top 10. It is a film capable of giving you deep emotions and of raising the spirit in the darkest moments and therefore a true heritage of humanity tout court.",8
"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",10
"This movie has stayed with me for several years after watching. And although its not my sort of genre.. it did deliver.

If you haven't watched this movie yet, i suggest not reading up on it and just go in blank for the best result. The story is just overall great and the casting is top notch. It really pulls you in and thats saying a lot for someone who has watched so many movies like me. So my recommendation is to load up on drinks and snacks before hitting the Play button.

After seeing this movie i searched for movies with the actors that shined in this one. But even they deliver mostly in all their films, its never like their performance in this.

The only reason im not giving a straight 10 is simply because of my way of rating. But if this was my sort of genre it would have been a straight ten! So overall, a must see movie.",10
"I have this film on DVD and it's one of my favourites. That said, it's been several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was still as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that I've been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school, probably a good 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation, and I've read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have been one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came out, way back in '82 or '83. It's a collection of four unrelated novellas, other than that each title has a different season mentioned in the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal, and it is, in my opinion, by far the best. If you haven't read it, I would thoroughly recommend it, particularly if you haven't seen the film as the movie stuck pretty closely to the original story so there won't be many surprises in store for you otherwise. Incidentally, if you've ever seen Rob Reiner's movie Stand by Me or Bryan Singer's Apt Pupil you'll find two of the other stories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress, back to the movie in question.

I wasn't disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly deserves it's place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their characters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see them, particularly Freeman, get gradually broken and institutionalised as the film plays out. And then, of course, you get that fantastic feel- good ending that you really wanted, but somehow never actually expected. But it's not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman that delight. Both Bob Gunton, the sadistic and greedy warden who somehow believes he is doing God's work, and Clancy Brown (remember him as the Kurgan in Highlander?) as the equally sadistic, almost sociopathic Captain Hadley, give wonderfully sinister performances.

Most of the other prisoners, with the possible exception of James Whitmore's Brooks, are fairly two-dimensional, but then the director almost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewer's attention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing bond.

The film begins in the 1940s, and continues on until the 1960s so it was essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it becoming dated in any way. Also, because it's set in a prison which appears almost completely isolated from the outside word, the passage of time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+ years ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours, it's probably one of the longer films in the list (although by no means the longest), but it keeps the viewer's attention for the full duration, and never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the plot forward in some way.

A definite 10/10 from me, and thoroughly recommended.",10
"No doubt one of the best film there is and ever will be. Everything about this movie, storyline, directing, acting, twists and turns and dialogues are great. One magnificent and rich story combine with excellent filmmaking. Doubt it any movie can replace this for me any time soon ...",10
"Everytime I see this movie, I can't stop watching. The voice of Morgan Freeman is making this movie. I wished there were more movies like this but I don't think there will ever be a movie which has the same quality as this one. If I could give it a 11, I would.",10
"Not much to say. This movie is a must-watch. I can not believe how well it was shot, how got the story was and how redeeming it is. I am very happy I have spent some quality time myself to watch it.",8
"This movie is the best example of whatever life throws at you, you can turn it around if you believe in yourself. One of the finest masterpiece. Not watching is just not an option.",10
"I'm quite ashamed to say that as a self confessed cinephile at the age of 37 I had never watched The Shawshank Redemption until today.

Of course I was aware of it and how highly regarded it is, but I had just never got around to watching it until today, and man was I glad I did.

I regard The Shawshank Redemption more as a work of art, beautifully put together and very simplistic in nature. At its essence this is a movie about people, about hope, about friendship. I thought Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman simply stole the show and showcased just what brilliant actors they are.

My personal favourite movie of all time is Christoper Nolan's The Dark Knight, but it is very hard for me to imagine another movie replacing The Shawshank Redemption as the greatest movie ever made, due to just how perfectly executed it was and how emotionally invoking it is as a viewer watching the story unfold.

An absolutely brilliant movie, one that must be seen by any film lover, and one that is well deserving of its place at the summit of the IMDB greatest ever movies chart.",9
Shawshank Redemption has been my number one movie since it came out. I can't find one problem with any of the actors any of the acting the script is wonderful and the buildings are incredible. I find nothing wrong with this movie and all I have to say is good things. One of the best movies I've ever seen.,10
"I love this film so much,it is my all time favourite movie,and I really dont think any film will have such a profound effect on me.It almost inspires you to do almost anything,and the tagline alone has a mystic and philisophical feel about it(Fear can hold you prisoner,Hope can set you free!).The great thing about this film is that it can represent anything that has happend in your life,good or bad.I think that is what gives an edge to this film,of which many films forget to include!It's quite funny to think that this film was a huge flop at the box office,and that it wasnt untill the film came out on VHS that it really got the world wide recognition that it so truly deserved!Beautifully made,inspiring and an emotional ride of hope and freedom!I absolutely love it,best film ever!!!!!!!!Stu.",7
"I have come here, writing my review, after just watching this wonderful film. My soul is full! Overflowing tears of joy down my face. Therefore, I am afraid that the tremendous emotion tremble will not let me be objective. However, I really do not care; I'm just writing to share with all of you the greatness of this movie. A movie that brings to screen hope, despair, true friendship, perseverance and human nature like no one before. If you just are reading reviews to see if the film is worthwhile, well don't lose more time and watch it!",10
Poetic Art .....be a long time before we see a movie of this caliber.,10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give us some of the most memorable performances of all times. In this wonderful adaptation of S. Kings short story, the human spirit and hope triumph over injustice and ""the system"". It will make you think. No doubt this will go down as one of the best dramatic movies of all times. I can't say too much or I will spoil it.",10
"I watch movies to glean life lessons. And while the ending of this movie puts the capstone on with Andy's lesson on Hope. There are so many other lessons that this movie displays; Perseverance, Optimism, the power of Humor. Shawshank Redemption proved itself to be the top rated movie in this database, I love it and too anyone who needs a movie for the ages, look no further then The Shawshank Redemption.",10
"In The Shawshank Redemption, we follow the story of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a man who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sent to the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Despite the difficult circumstances, Andy manages to find hope and purpose in his life, and he forms a close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis Boyce (played by Morgan Freeman).

The film is a heartwarming and emotional exploration of the enduring bond of friendship between Andy and Ellis, and it is a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit. The film also explores themes of hope and the importance of holding onto one's dreams, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

The acting in The Shawshank Redemption is superb, with standout performances from the entire cast. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are particularly impressive as Andy and Ellis, and their chemistry is electric. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film.

Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a heartwarming and emotional film that is not to be missed. It is a powerful exploration of friendship and the human condition, and it is also a moving and inspiring story of hope and redemption. Highly recommended.",10
"Honestly has to be considered one of the greatest films ever created.

Stephen kings short story makes a big and small screen story of hope vs despair, of never giving up vs acceptance of ones fate.

The voice over of Freeman is perfectly narrated, whilst the soundtrack is just phenomenal. Sularia being. a particular highlight but the original tracks are wonderfull.",7
"The Shawshank Redemption is to movie history what Muhammad Ali was for boxing, GOAT!

Yeah, I get it, some people mention the cheesy end but how could it end any different? 2 1/2 hours to then watch Andy pass away? Come on.

Perfect movie, perfect actors, just PERFECT!",10
"Stephen King does create wonderful short stories and while I think his books are hardly manageable on the silver screen I think his short stories are. Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption is the perfect example. With a great cast and an intriguing but not overly complex story this film has everything it needs to be a masterpiece. The actors have great chemistry together and while I don't appreciate the changes that were made, I do understand them. The director caught the feeling of the short story and created a believable experience. Some of the scenes are light hearted to an extent were you expect them to be free the next moment just to tear down this scene and show the degrading brutality of prison.",9
One of the finest movie I have ever seen in my life... Fully positive tears after finishing this...... Hope is Everything........................................................ Feel Good one...,9
""" The Movie"" that gained much recognization in the late 90s (& still rocking in everyone's favorite movie list) changed everything. I mean, it literally changed almost everyone's prespectives regarding life. Nothing to say about Direction & other relatable things (bc there's nothing to say about it, everything was pitch perfect.) Many filmgoers compared Andrew's story to Messiah (Jesus) changing everyone's life (directly or indirectly that matters to that person) & yeah, they're not wrong. They also said that the movie is actually about Red's belief about friendship, truth about life, dignity, joy, etc. Oh man, I might need more space to write about this movie bc there's so much to say but I don't know how to explain it! Actually, this movie is to experience it & relate to your life. Free from whatever you thought that blocking you to live YOUR life fullest. Best FRICKIN movie ever, Period. PS - There's still some imperfections about this film but please while watching this just focus on the story & it's depth, not it's faulty things.",10
This is a great movie. Based on a book of a great writer Mr King. I was happy to see great acting and representing the book as it was written. Highly recommend it,10
One of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. Heart-touching and inspiring. Very well executed and the performance was on point. This movie will leave you with a feeling of friendship for weeks.,10
Brilliant movie. It's about friendship that develops in a prison environment.,10
There's really a lot to be said for this movie. A true masterpiece. You don't understand how the time passes while watching the movie because its fluency and subject are perfect. I will recommend this movie to everyone and I will not neglect to watch it from time to time. Don't die without watching.,10
"I have never commented on a film but living as movie lover, a great movie lover, I've always been seeking for finest fine movies, movies that can't be forgotten, that would give a meaning to me... The Shawshank Redemption, it is a movie that I can't say anything about it else than powerful, well-made and meaningful to me, as God as my witness, to this moment I haven't seen any movie better than that ... It was recommended by a dear friend of mine but I never took seriously until I watched the first thirty minutes of it, then I regretted that I've never attempted to watch it before that moment Hope, something good never dies, I have hope that I believe in, and I believe that someday that hope will get me through life... The Shawshank Redemption, gives hope and that's enough for a movie... I don't have that great knowledge of movie, but I do believe that this is one of the finest movies that were ever made...",10
"There is life & humor in it, and warmth in the friendship. There is even excitement & suspense, although not when we expect it. Mostly Its about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. Its perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe thats part of the idea to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",9
"No, this is NOT the greatest film of all time. I don't think you could pinpoint one single film as that but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most powerful and moving experiences of the 1990's (other masterpieces include ""Schindler's List"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""The Piano"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", etc.) ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the harrowing story of a man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to prison to serve two life sentences. There he meets Red, who becomes his best friend. The film speaks loudly about hope and its unending importance in life and that is a lesson we too often forget. This film is a marvelous reminder, with remarkable performances by Tim Robbins and Oscar-nominated Morgan Freeman. It is beautifully written and expertly directed and a fine film in several aspects.

Regardless of whether it IS the greatest film of all time, the greatest film of the decade, or the greatest film of 1994, it is not to be missed for it holds wisdom and is great fun.",10
"This is one of the best films of all time, and I'm not kidding you. Yes, you're welcome to your Godfathers' and Citizen Kanes' but this is a film everybody can experience, preferably through the medium of cinema, for what it is, a truly great story, backed up by top notch performances by Robbins and Freeman.

Everyone I have ever spoken to has enjoyed this film and they were as surprised as me to find out that although nominated, the film did not receive one single Oscar. Why is it so, that a good film like Forrest Gump can win so many but a truly great film like Shawshank wins nothing?

Words cannot describe how great this film is, one to see again and again, and not just for the triumphant twist at its conclusion! Watch it!!",10
A day full of thoughts after you watch this and the remarkable feeling how you make a movie like this. Time is totally worth it. Don't expect it as a random prison story. Plain and simple.No action and effects. The truth to ultimate reality. No goofs as there's an explanation to every scene. I think every actor in the movie gave their best performances. Just awesome. Sad feeling all around but ending is awesome.Character Andy comes out to be cooler than you think he is and shows everyone this isn't it and you might think and which i thought to be so straight forward was his lucky cell location...which can certainly be overlooked because after this is what he deserved as he was innocent!,10
"This is quite far from being the best movie of all time. The characters are black and white in true blockbuster tradition. Everybody is either all good or all evil, and do not at all feel real. The plot is unoriginal (although it has a surprise ending, that's hardly original scriptwriting) The film is extremely cliche-ridden, and I don't recommend it to anyone who appreciate truly great films like the three colors trilogy etc.",6
"Considering hundreds of thousands have made this their top 4 all-time film, there isn't much that I can add -- that hasn't already been said (or known).

Acting -- from lead to support: superb. What works the best is the obvious interaction between Robbins and Freeman, and the internal mechanisms taking place within themselves and the other.

Screenplay -- Intelligent, eternal, interesting sub-plots, gripping, classic conflicts being resolved in a satisfying manner. My only beef with the script is Freeman's final statement to the parole board. I realize its irony, but didn't consider it credible.

Cinematography -- Every camera angle is well framed, positioned or filtered in choice moments.

This film is an emotionally satisfying experience that leaves one feeling good about life and its possibilities.

What a wonderful ending.",10
"Although I'm a big fan of Stephen King, nearly all of his movie adaptions just suck. There are two reasons for this: 1. A lot of directors which made adaption of King's stories are just inept.

2. Because King is such a great storyteller, it is extremely difficult to bring the story to celluloid.

But The Shawshank Redemption is one of the exceptions that proves the rule (Kubrick's The Shining is another one): it is relatively true to the original story (""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"") and most of the characters are beautifully portrayed.

King has proven to a lot of his critics that he is definitely not solely a horror writer and that he is a anything but a writer of cheap trash - some critics seem to make the assumption that horror is equivalent with trash.

9 of 10

"This movie is brilliant. There is no need to go into detail about the reasons behind my saying so. It is a film that everyone should simply take the time out to watch- to try to describe its qualities would be at best an injustice to this piece of treasure. I have never encountered a single person who regretted watching the film, and come on lets give it some more 10s so it can beat out the godfather! (which I haven't seen so maybe once I do I'll be singing a different tune)...but regardless, this film is amazing, and not many can compare to it at all.",9
"Sometimes, when you see a film, it touches you in such a way that you find it difficult to describe. 'Shawshank Redemption', is one such film. Everything is just class. Freeman should have had an Oscar for his performance as 'Red', and I find it amazing that 'Gump' beat it to best film. Don't get me wrong, 'Gump' is a good film, but in my humble opinion the only film that can come close to this is 'the Godfather'. The ending to the film is just incredible, one of the few times that I have ever almost cried during a film. I won't give anymore away about the film. Just go and see it.NOW.I mean turn off your computer and get a video or DVD of it by any means possible. I agree that this is one of the GREATEST films ever.",10
The dramatic experience we have never ever seen before.... Amazing ;-),10
"The Shawshank Redemption...where to begin? This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, it is an artistic masterpiece, both in story and it's visual elements.

I am a fan of the Stephen King short story from Different Seasons (if you have not read it, go out and do yourself a favor!), and I was very pleased with Frank Darabont's take on the story. It remains true to the story, and even improves it, I think.

The acting was also spectacular. Tim Robbins was phenomenal in the lead as Andy Dusfrene. He plays a great confident and quiet man, who has a hope, even when everything is stripped from him (the short story was in the section: 'Hope Springs Eternal').

Morgan Freeman is also great in this film. One of Frank Darabont (or is casting director) great improvements to the film. In the story, Red, who Morgan Freeman plays superbly, is an Irish white man. I like it a lot better with Morgan Freeman. I can't imagine anyone else. And I cannot forget about the supporting cast. This film didn't have a bad performance.

I really recommend that you see this. It is a cinematic masterpiece that will please anyone who has a heart. Please, do yourself a favor and see this great film by the great Frank Darabont!",10
Best movie of all time. The last 15 minute in best munites of my life.,10
"This is the best movie I've ever seen, actually, I think it surpassed the Godfather. There are four things that I liked about this movie. 1)The storyline is terrific and unique. A former banker went into prison of murdering his wife, but he hasn't done all of that. We haven't seen this kind of movie yet. 2)The theme. The movie is about prison, in our impression, prison is a bad place, and everybody that went to prison will be desperate. But not Andy, he got along with those prisoners, and kept thinking about escape. That educates the people, don't give up hope. 3)The character. The main characters were impressive, Andy: He was well-educated, and unlucky, hopeful, and intelligent. Red: He was friendly, smart, but he wasn't hopeful. He didn't know what to do after the parole. Anyway, he overcame it at last. 4)The acting: Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did an excellent job in acting, and every single character in the Shawshank Redemption did well. Well, I think this movie has taken Godfather's place, to be the best movie I've ever seen.",10
"This is an amazing Adaption of Stephen King's story. A timeless story/movie that you will watch again and again,",10
"I've been hearing a lot of positivt things about this movie for a long time, and finally I had the opportunity to watch it myself.

My expectations were high, but to be honest I didn't expect it to be this good! This film is just excellent, and I warmly recommend it to everyone!",10
"When the great Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins do one of their best acting and William Sadler and Clancy Brown complete it and make it more beautiful, And the one who binds all these good men together is Frank Darabont, the result is a unique masterpiece called: The Shawshank Redemption.

You don't watch their acting for 2 hours and 22 minutes, but you live with them and even after the end of the movie, they live in your mind.

This film is a journey that after its end, life will not be the same as before.

This movie is a good memory that will never be erased from the mind.

The Shawshank Redemption itself is a redemption.",10
"I've never been in the military, I've never been in prison. I read books and watch movies. When I meet people who know the inside of either institution, I ask them, ""Is such-and-such a movie accurate?""

Whether ""Shawshank"" is accurate or not, I cannot find out! My friends who know prisons don't watch movies! But ""Shawshank"" is cinema storytelling at its finest. If you love a good story, and can handle some of the rougher things in life, this is your movie.

The choice of Morgan Freeman for the narrator, Red, was inspired. But I'm beginning to wonder if casting Morgan Freeman is ever less than inspired at any time, for any part. His warm voice and gentle accent is impossible not to listen to. I think that voice could keep your attention reading the dictionary aloud. His face is always interesting. If Morgan Freeman is in a movie, I'm willing to give the movie a chance.

This is the second Tim Robbins movie I ever saw. And this is quite a departure from his ""Nuke"" LaLouche in ""Bull Durham"". His performance is intelligent, understated, intense. He is a great movie actor--he doesn't need to speak to communicate volumes.

But the real star of ""Shawshank"" is Stephen King. He has become the premier storyteller of our day. He puts words together to make magic like no one I've ever read. And his stories translate so well to the screen. ""Stand By Me"" proved it. ""Shawshank"" confirms it. All hail, Stephen King!

If you haven't seen ""The Shawshank Redemption"", do so. Maybe, like me, you'll be looking to buy the video for your small collection of movies to be seen over and over again.",10
"This movie released 1994 but till the movie is the number one. There are significantly several reason for this. I watch the movie many times and every time I find something new. 'Shawshank Redemption' is one of the best movie if you love to watch. There are so many story in one movie. So, if you a movie lover and till not watch the movie, just watch.",10
"This is a great example of how a great movie should look like. A very good story, perfectly played characters. My favourite movie of all time.",9
"The movie revolve around null,so it is based on null and some order of alphabet",10
I loved this movie and it was one of the best I have ever seen. Truly amazing.,10
If there's a word better than the 'best' then I want to use it. But there's no other word then the best. Let's just say it's the best. You can watch this movie like a million times but you'll never get bored. You can watch this move any time anywhere you want. That's why we says it's the best tie movie with The Godfather.,10
"Upon seeing The Shawshank Redemption, I realized that a movie can be so good and so powerful that it can keep you in awe for a long time. I saw Shawshank years ago and have probably seen it fifty times since then and not once have I been bored or uninterested. I have been blown away by this movie since the first time that I saw it. There is truly no movie better that The Shawshank Redemption. There is no better story and there is certainly no better theme. Redemption, hope and friendship have been displayed in the finest form leaving you filled with the two former. Truly, the greatest film ever made.",9
"After my yearly watch I am sat here with the same feelings if not more from my first watch way back when at the cinema - The movie is a masterpiece, great direction, cast, setting and heart.

From the start it sets out a message for the movie and continues along a theme throughout.

Clancy Brown plays his character so well as does the warden Bob Gunton, with great side parts especially from William Sadler. But the movie is about the relationship between Andy and Red and how that develops over time to end with that final scene of hope given form.

It's one of them movies that one day they will try and remake and on that day I shall feel sad. I hope they don't try, I hope to continue to see my friends Andy and Red as they are now as Morgan and Tim.",10
"I don't easily remember the names of actors of Hollywood movies, neither do I ""ever"" take the time off, writing comments on any movie, but for this movie i ""have"" to do it all.

The whole way of presenting this movie has been outstanding, i.e. from the beginning to the end. Great performances (Tim Robbins & Freeman Qualifying as one my favorite actors). The whole presentation has been very apt to the movie. But what is important is the strong message this movie transcends, i.e. of Hope, is truly recommendable.

This movie deserves an intent watch by ""all"". Do take you some time off to watch the movie,if not twice, be it once.",10
"Cinematography, Acters, Story ,direction all super",10
"The Shawshank Redemption, I first viewed this film when i was maybe 8 or 9 and i didn't really understand then. When i saw it later in life my appreciation for the film grew and constantly does every time i view it. It is the first large film from Frank Darabont and he directs with such feeling it doesn't strike as a beginning for his career but, more as it was done by a professional at the art of film making.

The Shawshank Redemption is a story of courage, friendship and confinement in the setting of a large prison in New England, Shawshank. Andy Dufresne is a gifted banker who is convicted of murdering his wife because she was cheating on him with a golfer. He is sentenced to two life sentences to be served at the Shawshank Prison. Andy arrives, and is judged by his suit as a rich man who will crack on the first night, Andy does the contrary. He ends up showing his strength in silence, he doesn't make attempts to make friends until one day when he needs an item. Ellis Redding, he's the man in this particular prison who knows how to get things and does so for people willing to pay the extra 10% on the item. Andy introduces himself in the yard and asks for an item 'Red' isn't anxious to get it for him at first, but gives in at the end.

I wont reveal any more of the film for the reason that, you have to experience it yourself. All that i can convey across this review is be prepared to be affected in ways you never imagined. I would go as far to praise it as one of the most powerfully affecting stories ever conveyed through film. Don't presuppose anything just because it was overlooked at the Academy Awards, Superb acting, directing, cinematography and story telling will magnetize you.

9/10 ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""",10
"When I saw that this movie had 9.3 on IMDb I thought it was overrated because the only movie I have seen close to that score is the godfather and that is a masterpiece. So I thought it would just be an okay movie but holy moly this movie is so good in every way! This movie is seriously flawless and I have never seen a movie with so few thing holding it back and I dont really have the words to express my feelings to this film it is just truly amazing.

Summary: Might be the best movie I've ever seen.",9
"It's not about the story it self that makes this movie so amazing. This story is a typical Hollywood story that is easy to put together by anyone. And it could easily be a mediocre film with other producers, directors and actors. But they nailed this one.

This movie became great because of the right combination of actors, directors and producers. With the right music and with the right lines at the perfect time.

Some movies just gets everything right. We may not always being able to understand it. It's just like all the stars in the universe was lining up at the time and place. And that's when masterpieces is born like this one. You can just feel it's something magical about these movies.",10
"The popularity of this film seems to stem with the current emotional appeals and issues of today, just as Citizen Kane seemed to do when it was revived. What makes Citizen Kane more appealing to me though is the abundance of creativity in telling the story.

If you want a highly emotional experience, I would watch this movie. Since I am for more intelligent and unpredictable type films, I am not one for movies like this.

And if I would explain the movie in one sentence, I would say it is a classic cinema soap opera, perfectly crafted to emotionally stimulate movie viewers, in order for them to hold certain perspectives on societal issues.",10
"It deserves the rate No. #1 Of all time The viewer doesn't need more than simple budget to enjoy the films This movie well done Great choice for the actors no much nudity , violence at the minimum I can give it 10/10 without thinking twice.",10
"So there I was, relaxing one Sunday evening in front of the TV. Suddenly an advert for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" appeared - it was on in an hour on Channel 4 (fourth out of five for you non-Brits). I thought, ""Hey, I remember that film. It's number one in the IMDB ratings."" I always wondered why - I remember watching it a few years ago and thinking it was pretty good. So I thought I would sit myself down and watch the thing properly... Thank God I did. That film is absolutely fantastic. I sat rivetted for the full two and bit hours of it. The sheer complexity of the plot, the twists, the character development. The ending. You can sort of understand why it got nominated for so many Oscars. As I mentioned earlier I always wondered why this film seems to have spent most of its time at the top of the IMDB chart - not Star Wars, the Godfather, Citizen Kane even. Now I know. I suppose most of the people who have read this far would know how good this film is - but if not, here's my advice. Watch this film!",10
"Emotional and gripping from start to finish, the Shawshank Redemption is the pinnacle of movie making. All performances are well done especially that of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. All characters are realistic and done so well it makes you feel like a prisoner at Shawshank. Very rarely do we get a movie that moves the viewer the way this movie did. A steady plot from start to very strong finish, this movie is a masterpiece. A must see for any cinema junkie!",10
"This movie is probably in my top 10 of all time. The premise is absolutely amazing and the main character is both simultaneously a badass and a reserved man It had very emotional moments that have stuck with me for a long time, and the quotes that come out of this movie are top tier. My only minor criticisms are that I think the relationship between Andy and Red could have been more built up in the beginning, and I am personally not a big fan of introducing new characters in the middle of movies. Besides those minor things, this movie is amazing .",10
"I can't say anything about this movie other than it's a golden movie classic. I saw it for the first time the year it came out: first in theaters, then on VHS. In 2007 I bought it on bluray. And very recently I got hold of the book on which this masterpiece is based: ""Special Seasons"". It's truly amazing how a 30-sheet novel was made into one of the greatest films. To create a masterpiece - this is the pinnacle of directing and scriptwriting. Books are usually much better than movies. Why? Because you have something beautifully developed, and the director's goal is to fit it into, say, 120 minutes. A cutting begins, which finally gives birth to something that can hardly be compared to the book. Here we have clearly the opposite effect.

One of the most meaningful movies. They haven't been photographed like this for a long time. A must for the younger generation as well.",10
"I am just here stroking the ego of one of the greatest films of all time its not really a useful comment but I am sure there will be plenty of useful ones out there. I can't give it 10, its not within me to give any film a 10 seeing as nothing is perfect, and moments of this film did seem a little unbelievable...

Its a great story, great acting blah blah blah the film industry is not dead as long as for every Michael Bay film coming out their is a film like this in existence

get it and watch it but don't show it to kids because it depicts suicide and violence and they might go out and kill someone......",9
"From long time I am a member of IMDb but I never try write a review. But in this case I can not ignore writing review option.

The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. He adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning the film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is always better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here. King is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the prison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire film. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well drawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script.

Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the triumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will love ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important.",10
"My story is one of fate. I went to the video store expecting to get Terminator II on laserdisc. It was out, and out of desperation to rent something, I asked for what was new. I was given the ""Shawshank Redemption"". I had never heard of it, quite honestly, but I gave it a try but was not expecting much but two hours of ""time pass"".

The first time through watching it, I thought it was good. Nothing extraordinary. But something made me watch it again. And I was hooked. I can't explain it, but this movie gets better every time you watch it. I ended up watching it about 8 times in that 4 day timespan.

Watch this movie, as your bucket list of things to do in life. You really have not lived till you have seen it.

I admit to being completely obsessed by the movie, owning it on every medium imaginable, and having all the books and posters about it. But do not let my obsession dissuade you. I do not impress easily, but I can tell you this is simply the greatest movie ever made in cinema.

Every moment and every dialog of this movie fits in perfectly to create the greatest masterpiece in American cinema.",9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a masterful cinematic achievement that continues to captivate audiences even decades after its release. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on a Stephen King novella, this film delivers a powerful story of hope, friendship, and the indomitable human spirit. Tim Robbins delivers a remarkable performance as Andy Dufresne, a man wrongly convicted of murder, while Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is nothing short of mesmerizing. The film's pacing is perfect, gradually building tension and delivering emotionally charged moments. With its impeccable screenplay, breathtaking cinematography, and a hauntingly beautiful score, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless classic that explores themes of redemption and the resilience of the human soul.",10
"Frank Darabont is a genius. In one of the most critically acclaimed, famous movies in Hollywood history, the director from France has created a work of art. Superb performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the film throughout its fairly lengthy duration of 137 minutes smoothly. The film has a very slow pace, but somehow it is incredible absorbing, not boring in the slightest. The story follows Andy Dufresne, (Tim Robbins), a young banker who, despite protesting innocence, is jailed with back to back life sentences for killing his wife and her lover that she ran away with. Once at Shawshank Prison, he developes a friendship with Ellis Boyd Redding- ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman). Red is a man who ""knows how to get things"", i.e he smuggles things in from the outside world. What unfolds is not what you might expect- it's not the kind of prison film that has a gritty, explicit view of the bad things that happen in prison. Whilst this is shown to a certain extent, its not as bad as it could be and the bad sides generally come from the corrupt screws rather than the cons. This is a moral tale, as suggested by the tagline ""Fear can hold you prisoner....hope can set you free"". It's the kind of film that you can enjoy immensely, watch again and again, and really take a message about life away from. My favourite film, along with Pulp Fiction of the same year, I give it 10/10",10
"There are only a few movies that command your attention no matter when you come across them. This is one of them. If it is on TV and I am scanning the channels, once I hit this movie I MUST stay till the end. I must have seen it at lest a dozen times now.

Here are some stray thoughts on ""Shawshank""

It contains the most beautiful narration job (Morgan Freeman) that I have ever heard. I could listen to it alone with no pictures and it would shine!

This movie holds some kind of record for small moments that are HUGELY memorable. e.g. Andy plays the opera record....beers in the sun....Brooks and his bird....Billy gets shot....Andy in the rain....Morgan Freeman in the field finding Andy's ""treasure""....the gorgeous Blue Pacific ending....and there are so many more.

There may be some movies made that are as good as this one but I can't imagine any being better.",10
"Can I say anything more about this winner. . . Once seen, it totally speaks for itself and I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is so immaculate. My hat's off to the production company that has created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages about love, perseverance, and brotherhood - and it does it with marvelous succinctness. By far, one of the greatest films I have ever seen - a masterpiece for today! Easily one of the most awesome movies I've ever seen in my life. The movie has a great message to it, the acting and filming were fantastic as well, wow!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever made. I first saw this movie last summer and really didn't know what to expect, given all the stupid early 90s movies that are out there. But once about 10 minutes in a realized that this was going to be a great movie, and it was. It, in my opinion, portrayed what it really would be like to live in jail and, for me, how unfair the justice system can be given andy was obviously innocent. They way he escaped was pretty cool too. So, if you have not seen this movie as of now go out and rent it. It is definitly worth it. ***** outta *****",10
"Both the story and acting is very good. Though not provoking, the film doesn't stop when the credits starts rolling. It will make you think.

This film slowly takes off and has no really element of suspense. It's a human story without any fast action. The production contains no surprises and make the viewer concentrate 100% on the story.

...but my single issue is how long it takes for the film to get interesting. For me almost an hour. Maybe this is necessary to build up the story. A high rated film needs to be great from the start. The first part is a film true to it's genre and quite predictable.

I can's stop thinking that this film's outstanding rating on IMDb, like some others, maintain their position of obvious reasons. When a film (or music album)is considered among the best, new reviewers are affected by this status.",10
"This is movie making at it's best. This movie has no flaws. Unlike other movies in it's category this is niether slow moving nor boring. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has excellent characters, a moving theme, and subplots that are more intense then some movies alone. Morgan Freeman has the best narration of all narrations. The music is inspiring. I especially like the opening of the movie. Starting with his conviction then going on to Morgan Freemans character, and conecting the two with the line ""when andy dufrain asked me to get him rita haywrith, I said fine."" Then the splendid shot of the prison. (personally my favorite cinematographic achievment ever)",9
"Story telling at its finest. A movie that makes you care about its characters and what happens to them makes this truly a movie to love. It's also a movie that everyone can watch and enjoy, not just a subset of viewers. If you've not watched this classic movie you're doing yourself a disservice. Perfect in every way possible.",10
"This the most overrated movie I have seen, how this movie is number 1 on IMDb is beyond me. Now this movie isn't bad it's just that the movie is so over rated that there are movies not in the top 250(Jurassic Park) that I'd rather watch than this. And that are more ground breaking than this movie was. Now the best part of this movie in my opinion is Morgan Freeman he is just SUCH a talented actor in the position he plays in this movie. He is the main reason I watched this movie. This is not Morgan's best movie but certainly not his worst. The reason I gave this a 7 is how over rated it is. I'm not saying I hate this movie, which I don't, I'm just shocked at the fact that its number 1?! There are a lot more movies out there that deserve more credit than this film.",9
"I must start by stating that I have watched the movie at least 20 times. This is a masterpiece , work of a genius . And I recommend everyone to watch this movie at least once in their lifetime .

But .. yes there are some buts, when you get over the initial amazement this movie brings to you you will find out that the plot was not very solid. There are lots of very big loopholes (potholes ?? ) in the plot. Like how weird is it that the prisoner is in the same cell for 20 years .Or, he did not have another cell on his right, or he knew there will be thunderstorm on the right he decided to flee. I personally felt very bad after I realized these very very weak links in the movie which actually weakens the foundation of the whole movie. It's like after worshiping a person for 20 years of your life you come to know some thing really bad about him .

At one point of time I used to very strongly vote that if any movie deserve to be the number 1 on IMDb, it's this movie. I am not so convinced anymore .",10
"Simply put, ShawShank is the best movie ever...bar NONE. A very good story, excellent directing and production and a stellar cast. Was robbed by the Academy when they gave best picture to Forrest Gump. A great movie for the family (13 and over) and surely a movie you will watch again and again.",9
"I should say that usually I'm not much into drama. But the beauty of The Shawshank Redemption magically forced me into watching the whole film three times over the years.Its the kind of movie that is so powerful and realistic you become glued to your seat until the end. The twist at the end gave the movie a perfect finish without affecting the fine gist of the whole movie. Shawshank Redemption teaches us, improves our feelings about the world and changes our expectations about 'luck'.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver their best performance to date. If Tom Hank's movie Forrest Gump was not made in the same year, this would most certainly be the winner of the 67th academy awards.",9
"I have seen this movie about 6 times and I get stunned every time. Now has past one year since I last saw her, so it got me thinking; what is so good about this film? is'it the story? the director? the actors? or maybe just all of this things?. I mean what makes this the best movie ever made?? Is'it the feel-good feeling in the end? I don't know a person whose does't feel good after this movie. Tim's and Morgans's performances both deserved Oscar, but I'm not gonna take'it from Tom Hank's that his performance in Forres Gump also deserved Oscar. So if anyone can tell me the ONE thing that make's this the best movie ever made.",10
"It's been a long time since I saw the movie and I still have it as the best memory when I sit in front of TV and enjoy the magic of a magnificent movie.

Yesterday, we had a discussion on a Chinese movie board about which is the best movie in history. The answer was Shawshank's Redemption. It's a movie delivering good sense of hope in life and the best story to inspire people truly from inside. I feel I gotta say something about it again when it's the time of 10 years anniversary for such a great movie.

Many people are still talking about whether it should have got above Forest Gump in 1995 Oscar. I personally think it's reasonable for Forest Gump winning Oscar. But I think there is one actor who should have won a supporting actor : James Whitmore who acted old Brook in the movie. I don't know why, but his character impacted me the most. Esp. when he got free and began narrate the letter he wrote to his prison folks. I am a young man and did not have enough experience in life, but I felt something there, strongly, something that made me moved to tears. The director did great jobs in this sense, bringing quite a few characters who are far yet close to us. They have weakness and doubt in life just like we did in our lives. Everyone make mistakes, some are small which can be ignored, some are so big that even a life time sentence does not judge enough. But they are common. the thing is what you realize in life: Incarnation or refreshment.

I cant say how much the movie changed my life. This might be the only movie so far to change my life ever. But I can say I became a better person after this. (I am not saying I was a bad guy , keke). And I will think about hopes no matter how bad are the situations. The movie is pure magic.

I saw the movie with my mom, who usually does not see Hollylwood movies. But this is the second movie which did not make her sleep.(keke, the other one was Titanic) I did not expect anything more from the movie , yet it ended as a magic night for me.

I can keep going on and on talking about how great the movie was. And I think the reason for those people who do not enjoy the movie that much is because they already know or expect too many things before seeing it. I am sorry that nowadays there are not so good movies around in Hollywood and I hope I can find another magic one soon.

I will buy the coming DVD and put in my shelf. I hope someday I can let my son see it and tell him how important hope is.",10
"At first glance, tis may seem like your typical ""Tale-from-the-past"" story. You've got Morgan Freeman narrating a a story, so it's got to be good right? Well, the truth is, it is. Reluctant at first, I was swiftly charmed by this story of mans struggle with life's cruelty. Tim Robbin's Character simply gets pummeled by life, but continues to keep his mind set on the hope. It's this message that captivated me. Despite the typical fairytale ending, it's the journey to that ending that makes this film great.

The characters, have to face some of the hardest obstacles that life could throw at one person. Yet, despite the odds, they somehow are able to not only enjoy what little glimmer of light they have, but keep hope alive. This is something that was genuinely charming about this film. In today's cynical society, a reminder of hope, and the reassurance that some times, the good guy does pull it off, is something many movies lack.

Now, the film itself isn't bright or happy, in fact it's the complete opposite. Dark lighting, tight shots, and rough settings are what give the film it's harsh reminder that life isn't just a walk in the park. But with charming, lovable characters, and novel-like writing give this film a balance that simply makes it irresistible.

This film is a must see classic. Has very mature content, not suitable for children.",10
"Shawshank is an example of the beauty and power that great cinema can conj our. A deceptive film of prison life that contains violence, humor, an extremely tear-jerking moment. A lot happens, yet the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. This film works on so many levels and definitely rewards repeated viewing. The cinematography and music are wonderful, as are the central performances. Yet for all this it is the tale itself and how it is told that makes this (one of) the greatest stories ever told. People have theorized about what this film means ...is it an disguised story of Jesus?...a simple tale of friendship?...a tale of corruption?...a lecture on faith and 'holding on'?...or is the main character not who we think it to be for 3/4 of the film? After all there is one major 'redemption' in this film: a man who has to decide whether ""It's time to get busy dying, or get busy living"". REDEEM YOURSELF, SEE THIS FILM.",10
"Truly a work of art.

A great movie with a little bit of everything thrown in. Like The Green Mile (Which is also another brilliant prison movie & King adaptation) this has to be one of Stephen Kings best horror stories and pretty much one of the best prison films ever created. What could be more horrifying than being locked up for the rest of your life in a prison like Shawshank knowing you're innocent?

With great acting by a top notch cast, a brilliant score, superb screenplay & direction by Frank Darabont and a simple message of hope, what's not to like?

I highly recommend this movie. And if you haven't read the book yet then go out and buy it. It's pretty short but you'll be glad you did.",10
"After just watching this film again for a fifth time or something, i felt compelled to do my very first movie comment on IMDb. This movie left me shaken with so many emotions, after a ride through so many more of those emotions throughout the movie, that i am sure i will watch it again not too far in the future. Maybe ride is not the best way to describe this, it was more like an gentle but firm hand guiding me along, letting myself be the one who decides how to react to the turns and pictures of this film. And just when i started to catch the drift and thought I've had it all figured out, this film surprised me once more in a way i never would have suspected.

Another big plus is that you don't get distracted by the actors, because they are all at their best. Every character has some real contribution to the story, and the actors are just great in their roles. Amazing is a better word. Great Acting! I never had a reason to doubt any characters authenticity.

I have never checked if this movie has been nominated, or won any prices, but if it hasn't, it should. I don't now if the story of this film could happen in the real world, but the emotions it invoked in me are true and real, and it got me thinking about life and the way i conceive freedom in a whole new way.

I apologize for my writing style for i am not a native English speaker. Any corrections or improvements are welcome and appreciated as i am alway keen to learn.",10
All the drama of a falling rock. If SK lived in the Victorian Age this would be a morality play--and both would be dead and forgotten by now--just the idea of it makes me want to live another 100 years or so.,9
"I saw this film when I was fourteen, and at the time it was the most flawlessly impressive piece of storytelling I had ever seen. If I were forced to make a top 10 list this movie would certainly be right up there. Robbins and Freeman are both incredible, and as good as they are in other films I would still say it remains their finest work. The scenery and costumes, the prison which if I remember right was an actual prison back around the same time the film took place. It is all so rich with texture and detail that it draws you in. The story is great, Stephen King has written some amazing stories and this is a testament that he is not just a horror novel expert. The actors all take it to the next level and make it a pretty much perfect film. It is pretentious to say a film or any piece of art is perfect, however I honestly can't say there is anything I dislike about the film. No scene seems long and unnecessary, every actor is perfectly cast and feels very authentic. It really is the real deal. Like American History X and some other films it is a movie that everyone with a moderately high IQ and a love of cinema should see one day.",10
"This movie was far ahead of its time. It had the best picture, soundtrack, brilliant acting, decriptive characters, masterful storyline as in example illustrated the ideal prison life to the bone, and was first of its kind to come out with a unbelivable(shocking) ending. If you haven't watched this movie yet, you are depriving your eyes from the ""amazing"" it craves. The ending is so beautiful, one can't dare to imagine.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is not just a movie, it's a phenomena, it's a one of kind and that's for sure.

The man who wrote such a story is a genius, and of course the director who used the story perfectly to make such a movie, and the actors ""Tim Robbins"" and ""Morgan Freeman"" made such a perfect role specially ""Tim Robbins"" because ""Morgan Freeman"" never made a bad role ever, but ""Tim Robbins"" didn't make great roles in many movies so his role in this movie is spectacular.

One of the best scenes in the movie is the one when the prison manager took his bible and was about to leave and then remembered and gave him the bible saying ""Salvation is within"", not knowing that if he opened the bible he will find the tool ""Robbins"" used to dig!! And in the end ""Robbins"" leave the bible with a small note saying ""You were right, salvation is within""!! Amazing.",10
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about this amazing film?

Everything about it is superb. Everything from the acting to the script is one of the most amazing pieces of work to ever hit the screen.

Now I know it is an old film, but it was a classic from the instant it was made and nothing was going to change that as it had the ingredient of a outstanding achievement that any parent would be proud of.

If you struggle to watch this film, then you must struggle with life in general.

I mean even the colour grading and attention to detail was just brilliant and like I said, I cannot say anything else about it that someone wouldn't have already said, apart from, if every film was as good as this, I would never go out again.",10
"Normally I am very lazy at writing comments, but this film has made me do it. The film is marvelous and beautiful. At, First I thought It was just another escape from the jail movie. But how the two and a half hour movie passed I didn't even come to know. I usually Fast Forward some scenes which I feel are regular but While watching this film I was so very mesmerized that I didn't even come to know how the time went by.

The character Mr. Morgan plays is really the best and worth for an Oscar. In fact all the characters were very good. One of the best about this movie is that there is only one female character and no sex scenes or any useless scenes which may be forcefully fitted in the movie.

All I could say is that this is a must watch movie.

Thats all folks",9
"When thinking of how to vote/rate a film such as The Shawshank Redemption, I can only think, ""What didn't I like?"" Honestly, there's nothing in this movie I can think of to make it better. Great story, great characters, great actors and great scenes.

Stephen King is an amazing story teller. Luckily, Frank Darabont has the ability to translate it into film.

When it's on TBS or USA, I always find myself finishing the movie whether it's just started or has 15 minutes left. I'd like to think of myself as a person with enough films under my belt to recognize an amazing piece when they cross my path. This on the other hand crossed my path, sat down, and entertained me.",10
"There are only a few words I have to say: Every time I watch that film, I have to cry. There are not many films, which get this result. Must have something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont. And the acting of the stars is just brilliant. As a matter of fact, I don't see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role. I only see two Persons: Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I saw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I will write something about the story: Of course I have read the original story written by Stephen King. It was, in a way different. It has not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie. When I think about this friendship between the two men... The sentence ""Get busy livin or get busy dyin"", well in a way it shaped my whole live. This is definitely the best film I have ever seen",10
I suppose directed while ago represented era even longer ago but shows the humans did not really changed in behaviour that much.... Drama as it should be!,10
"In the last 22 years, have seen this movie more than 30 times from start to end, but lost count of climax scene viewings.

Don't have to give away spoilers, but certainly can quote; ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" And so is this movie, a real classic.",10
"*SPOILERS* I'll just get it out of the way now. This is the prime example to prove that Morgan Freeman is among the greatest narrators ever, if not THE best. Tim Robbins, the lead in this movie, creates a great duo with Morgan Freeman, with the dialogue shared between the two feeling natural, as well as superb acting from both. The story line is what presents the backbone for these great performances as the narrative is a major part of what makes it one of the greatest films of all time. A man is accused for his wife's murder, is sent to prison where he serves life sentences which gives him the time to redeem himself (though he did not commit the crime is accused of) and eventually escape. The movie is full of great writing, acting, directing and cinematography and deserved to win at least one Oscar out of its seven nominations.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.

The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. He adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning the film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is always better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here. King is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the prison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire film.

"Shaw shank Redemption,is the best movie I have ever seen,which is different from common Hollywood story .The story is not complex , lacking of moving scenes which could be seen in many Hollywood stories .The director devotes to carefully picture the figures.It is the curiousness of the fate of Andy and Red that causes my interests. Andy if under a very awful situation.He is educated and thin , falling into a environment full of into violence ,if no painfulness and ill-treatment,it would be quite usual .Upon being put into prison,he firstly is a violence-taker.As an audience,at the very beginning,I could not tell Andy is not a murder,and hard to judge whether the adversities he gets are deserved.It is not a good element for recognition of a figure.The director solved this problem through Red¡¯voice incredibly.Voice out of the scene is to help narrator to complete the content which the pictures could not delivery.Especially,this movie is such long-lasting and large-contented one that needs voice out of movie so as to help us set up the recognition of Andy.Though the story by the time does not show how much good Andy has,we have liked him.When Andy helping the bad prison policeman,I did not blame the deed he did morally,but glad to see his situation turning well. With the emotional narration of Red,we could see more and more good form the inside of Andy.He relies on his knowledge and persistence, even regardless of the punish of being throw into a locked room, bringing knowledge ,music,not just spiritual change, but the hope of life .We also know that Andy is virtually innocent, when being informed that the president of prison letting the unjustic case of Andy alone instead of killing Tommy who is only one could proof Andy innocent. By the time, the audience tend to stand at the side of Andy and be angry with the innocent prison life of Andy. Andy finally escapes from the prison and takes away all the money from the president of the prison with illegal method.But no one is unhappy.This movie has a classical Hollywood end,but I do not think it is common, because I am fascinated by the story and hope to see such ending .It is the charm of Hollywood.",10
"Do I feel that the Shawshank Redemption should be on the Top 100 films of all time list? No. Do I feel it is the best King adaptation out there? No. Did I thoroughly enjoy it? Yes. Disregarding the answer to the first two questions; what we have here is a pretty watered down story about a man (Tim Robbins) who is imprisoned for the murder of his adulterous wife and her lover. While there he becomes a ""better person"" through the tutelage of a co-inmate; Morgan Freeman in a pleasantly subdued performance, who shows him the ropes of prison life. Everyone knows how the end of the film goes; but it is getting there that is the fun part, for the most part. There are scenes in the film of great fascination; scenes that may haunt you, scenes that may evoke shrill laughter, and scenes that may cause you to ponder the meaning of life. Overall viewing is worthwhile but not essential as this site and various others would lead you to believe.",10
"Wonderful story I feel contact, suspense and excitement with the story and actors was carefully selected I recommend watching this movie",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.

All in all, I think it is a very good film and worthy everybody to watch it, the most important sentences ¡°Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, No good thing ever dies.¡± It is really make us thinking deeply, and another one which was said by Red, he said that there has one kind of birds that you could never keep him in the cage, because every feather of his body was covered by the brilliance of freedom. I think everyone should remember this, everyone of us are covered by some brilliance of our own, we should never give up no matter how difficult it is! And we should remember that ¡°hope is a good thing¡± ,we should have hopes for all our lives!

"I first saw Shawshank the first year it came out. 28 years later, it remains one of the best movies I've ever seen. A remarkably well-written cast complimented not just by a talented cast, but by a group of actors perfectly cast in their roles. It's a story about friendship, hope, perseverance that still holds up three decades after it was released. I rarely give movies a perfect 10 rating, but Shawshank is up there with as close a perfect film as there is, and one of the greatest films of all time.",9
"An extraordinary testament to the power of hope. In my view, the most perfectly scripted and acted movie ever made.

The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that travels full circle from guilt to retribution to redemption. In the end, the insolent and obtuse pay the ultimate price for their arrogance.",10
The wonderful masterpiece which is very emotional and gives a sigh of relief at the end. Wonderful movie and amazing chain of events level screenplay. One of the finest work by Stephen King.,10
"This film is truly one of the greatest of all time. Much like the other works based on Stephen King novels, there is a main storyline to follow, and then another deeper story.

Morgan Freeman does a very impressive job portraying a man who has been held prisoner by his own fear of the outside world, and who is eventually freed by hope. Tim Robbins also did an excellent job, but Frank Darabont really deserves a lot of credit for fleshing out this beautifully written script into a great movie.

This is a movie that warrants multiple viewings. Four stars!",10
"This was a great movie -- no question about it, but it shouldn't be listed as #1 on the ""Top 250."" I whole-heartedly agree with many of the others who commented along these lines. How could anyone possibly put this film above ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""2001,"" or even ""Shindler's List,"" or ""The Godfather""? It had all the right qualities: a great story, terrific acting, good musical score, etc., but it just doesn't stack up against many other truly great films. I guess it just got the most 10's in the voting... Popularity has its advantages.

That aside, I felt as if the story could have been structured a little better. That was the movie's only real flaw. Because we only find out about how Andy pulled off his ""redemption"" after the fact -- and it's all told later, through Red's narration, we never get any of the excitement of rooting for Andy, fearing for him, etc., wondering if he can pull it off. We are left as oblivious to it as the warden was. Had the audience been in on it, it would have been a much more satisfying film to watch, and the ending would have been all that more sweeter. Compare this film to ""The Great Escape"" and you'll know what I mean (another film deserving a higher ranking!)",10
"I do not normally consider myself to be much of a drama fan, having always preferred the action-adventure genre. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the film that changed that feeling for me, and reading the other comments and reviews, for a lot of other people as well. Frank Darabont made a giant leap forward from his previous efforts in the ""B"" horror film world when he came up with this gem. Tim Robbins turned in his best performance as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman was brilliantly cast as Red. This is a ""Feel-Good"" movie of the first order, and well worth it's number 2 ranking on the IMDb top 250. Everything works in this film, the score, the acting, the realism of the prison scenes, absolutely everything! ""Shawshank"" is as close to a perfect film as you will ever see. If you do not already own a copy of this masterpiece, run, do not walk, to the video store and purchase a copy. It should be in the library of every movie fan. A 5 star, 10 out of 10, classic movie!!",8
"Stephen King's original story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' has long been one of my favourites, and when I heard it was getting the Hollywood treatment I was suspicious (after all, Stephen King's Hollywood track record isn't exactly outstanding). Then I heard Morgan Freeman was involved, and thought, 'Sounds good!' I was living in England when the film was released, so had to wait until several weeks after the U.S. opening before I saw it. I took my husband along with me: he's not a huge King fan, and I think that the prospect of a two-hour-plus prison film based on a Stephen King story wasn't hugely appealing: but we both came out realising we had seen a truly great film. Strangely, British movie critics (on the whole) gave the film a much better reception than did the American ones, and right from the start SHAWSHANK has been more highly thought of there: the British film magazine EMPIRE has recognised its quality from the start, and in its recent tenth anniversary issue picked it as one of the ten best films of the 1990s (with detailed reasons). To me it's one of the ten best films I've ever seen: it's one that repays multiple viewings, and the two central performances are outstanding. I'm now eagerly awaiting the film's DVD release.",10
"Okay, I will not reiterate what praises others have said about this movie. I think it's brilliant and touching, and others have expressed this more eloquently than I can. See for yourself.

I just wish IMDB had a 1 to 100 scale for rating movies, instead of 1 to 10. Then I could give this movie a perfect 100, while giving something like ""Cinema Paradiso"" a 94 or 95. As it stands, I gave both movies a ten, but I think Shawshank is a shade better, and I wish a new ratings could reflect that opinion.",10
"Freedom and brave ¡°Birds need air, human need freedom!"" If you lose freedom in your life, you imagine what you can do? Maybe your world is grey; you can¡¯t control your behavior. That is too awful and miserable!

Andy is a good sample, he is a young and clever banker, and he was sentenced because he killed his wife, but he did not do that in fact, he have to stay at the boring prison at last. The truth is so cruel! Andy is brave person, I admired him very much.

He did a good job for the minister of prison nearly twenty years, with a place mood and tastiest. This is not easy. Under this badly environment, how can keep a place mood? Maybe most of people can not do that.

Andy had a great plan when he came into the prison. He did not plan to stay here in all his life. He must war with his freedom. He dipped a long road about 500 yards. The road stands for his freedom and hope. Rod is his good friend, and helps him a lot.

Shawshank Redemption is a good film. I got a lot from it. First, everyone is free, don¡¯t be controlled by others, you have your ideas and behavior. Second, don¡¯t give up your courage; face the truth with your braveness. No one can help you, but yourself. Third, if you want to succeed, the courage, strengthen tastiest and place mood.",10
"If you haven't seen this masterpiece, you need to watch it. If you look at the voting, 47.3% of the voters have given it a 10. I'd give it a 12, it's the best movie I've ever seen. This movie is hilarious at times, but parts of it can make you cry, it ends on a perfect note and has a great cast. I've seen this movie multiple times, and like it more every time.",10
"What can I say that hasn't been said. The beauty of this movie can hardly be put into words. The more I watch it, the better it gets. Mr. Darabont did a beautiful job of directing, I'm anxiously awaiting ""The Green Mile"" now. The little scenes are what makes it beautiful. Andy on the roof with his smile and the aerial shot of the prison while the music is playing. I don't want to spoil anything, but the quotes are what will stay with you. After seeing this film (way too many times according to those around me), I've adopted my particular philosophy from it. As Red says, ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'. That's goddamn right"". See this movie and vote it back up to #1 on the IMDB list.",9
"I dont really think anyone can put into words the greatness of this movie. This is a movie that truly makes you feel for the characters. No special effects, no action scenes, no big budgets, no dance floor soundtrack. This movie is sheer genius.

So many prison movies have been made before but you never get a hint of a feeling of how is must really feel like to be jailed for life. This movie got me well and truly depressed. I really felt for the characters of Andy and Red. Two decent human beings with a true friendship, stuck in jail watching their lives go by within the inescapable prison walls. The projection of the prison, its guardians and its system was superb. You realise that the prison is a world of its own, and with time, in order to survive you have to learn to accept that world and forget about the outside, or do you? This movie in a way tests you. 'Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things' says Red at the end. But near the end, I found myself losing hope altogether. I felt that this movie would end with Red and possibly Andy dying in prison. I do not get at all emotional when watching a movie, but the closing scene brought tears to my eyes and a lump in my throat, and I still get choked at that scene everytime I watch it. The scene and narration with Brooks in the half-way house is also very powerful.

The discussion between Andy and Red after Andy's time in solitary is spell-binding. Some scenes are shocking. By the way I have probably seen this movie 30-40 or so times and still watch it.

The music (especially when Andy arrives at Shawshank in the prison bus shown in an overhead shot, simply beautiful!!), the story, the direction, the acting, the cinematography, the characterisation. I honestly cannot fault this movie and I think it is simply criminal that this movie did not win any Oscars. I think that by comparison, Forrest Gump was a load of rediculous mindless trash. I just could not understand what the fuss was about with Forrest Gump. But thats another story. Another example of Big Budget nonsense over-shadowing good quality movies. The Shawshank Redemption is in a league of its own and Tim Robbins deserved an Oscar for best actor as did Morgan Freeman for supporting actor in his portrayal of Red.

This movie is also an eye opener for so called 'expert critics'. Just go back and see the initial reviews this movie got when it was first released. I personally never go on what these critics have to say and movies like The Shawshank Redemption remind me why. No wonder they're always giving 'two thumbs up' for every half baked movie that comes along. They're probably all thumbs and no fingers.

The Shawshank Redemption is my all time favourite and I'll give this movie two thumbs + eight fingers = 10 out of 10",9
"The greatest movie ever made. The script is amazing. Tim Robbins is amazing. Morgan Freeman is amazing. The rest of the cast is amazing, particularly the guy who played the villain in Highlander. The film is just amazing and it is tragic that it was overlooked by the academy.",10
"For me, the best movies inspire emotion. This movies does just that for me, better than any other movie to date.

The message here is one of mostly one of hope with a dash of justice thrown in. There is hope for the unjustly incarcerated, and justice for those who do wrong. Andy DeFresne, despite all the odds against him, never lets the situation get to him. Red finds his hope through Andy.

The onscreen performances are superb. Every character has dimension and adds to the message. The screenplay, the most important component of any movie, is simply flawless.",10
"I think most of what I think about this movie has already been said in a number of positive and negative reviews already available for reference. It certainly is what I would classify as a great movie, but since I haven't seen as many films as I would like, I'm not sure whether it would be appropriate for me to call it a ""best of all time"".

You know when you see the end of a movie and it leaves you so shocked it takes your breath away(think ""Sixth Sense"")? Let me put it this way: have the Resolve carpet cleaner handy, for you will be dropping drinks throughout the movie. It surprises you at every turn.

I'm not a movie reviewer, and all I know is how I reacted to seeing it the first few times. My family couldn't watch it with me, as my constant ""Oh my God!""'s annoyed them.

Just take my work for it and see it. It can't hurt you.",10
"Sucked into this movie by his earnest persona, I watched despite the (apparent) certainty that he would live out his whole life in prison for a crime he says he did not commit : a depressing thought but a totally upbeat movie as his character Andy moves from surviving to molding the lives of others in a positive way. Told from the viewpoint of fellow prisoner recounting his experiences with Robbins' character (Morgan Freeman - another delight to watch) This movie, like its protagonist, is a champ! Watch this movie! I've seen it four times and still channel-stop on it.(PS Be sure to hiss at Bob Gunton as the truly evil and hypocritical warden! A real contrast to Andy's good nature and philanthropy.)",9
"One of the greatest movie I've seen. It tuched me deep in my heart. Absolutely brilliant.

Congratulations King.",10
"I'm not going to rattle on for hours about how good this film is, as I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. The plot twist in this film is second to none, just a pity it was ruined for me.... This film is a masterpiece and my third favourite film of all time, second only to The Godfather and Schindlers List. The Shawshank Redemption, 9/10. The second best film of the 1990's.",10
"This is why people watch movies. To escape from everyday life and sit completely absorbed in someone else's story. And what a wonderful story it is. On the outside it looks to be a sap of movie, the kind of movie that shamelessly wants to jerk some tears. But it bold enough to break free from the prison of other formula films. The cliches are all there and in familiar places but on a higher level and they are warm and welcome. This is the kind of movie that I will finish watching and feel the need to rewind it and play it again. This is truly one for the ages.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption Is the greatest movie of all time!!

What makes it great:-
Beautiful Screenplay
Really Good acting
Legendary Narration By Morgan Freeman
A fantastic Story by the legendary writer 'Stephen King'(Based on the novel 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'
When I first watched it, I was so amazed by how good it was.. I didn't recognise Tim Robbins in other movies but I can not imagine this movie without him.. I would say that if you haven't watched this movie once in your lifetime, You are missing out on something you should watch it now!",10
"I'm a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story. American movies doesn't always provide that.

The Shawshank Redemption, however, is a prime example of what American story telling can be.

With a slight non-linear build up, strong and patient character development, the movie drags you more and more into the despair of Andy Dufresne, but always with a sense of hope.

For me, there's no two ways about it. This is simply the best movie ever made.

10/10.",6
I have watched a lot of movies in my life but never watch any like this. What this movie doesn't have? This movie got everything,9
"OK let me start with your most beloved TV shows.Like for example,mine is friends.The last episode,the last season is always a heartbreaker,a tearjerker where you look back upon all the wonderful times and cry your heart out that it will never come back again.The shawshank redemption does just that and believe me within a span of two hours.

Man wherever he is,he is in heaven.He just realizes it after the time has passed.You can kill man's body,you can kill's man mind,but how can you kill hope.Man possesses a divine hope of spreading its wings into the sky even in the darkest of clouds.Imprisonment of the senses is possible,but how will you check the flow of love,it will flow till man is alive.We wish for a better future,but we already know that we cannot bid goodbye to our present,however wretched it is because we still have something to live for to hope for each day.Wherever man goes,if he has love in his heart,he finds love in others.

Morgan freeman is as natural an actor as there has ever been one.The sentiment of Stephen king has been instinctively been understood by frank Darabont and the final product is a lifetime of emotional journey through the eyes of a hopeful, Christ believing good man.",10
"I used to like action movies more than anything else. I watched Shawshank Redemption in 2007. When I watched it for the first time I did not know that it is a great movie. When I watched it for the second time I felt that it should be one of the greatest movies. For the first time checked IMDb's top 250 movies and I amazed to see Shawshank Redemption at number two, anyway, it's number one at present.

The performances of all the artists are excellent. Not a single character is waste. Especially Tim Robins excels as Andy Dufresne. Narration by Morgan Freeman is sensational. The scenes between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are by far the best. The ending is one of best surprises I have seen in movies.

This movie should have got the Ascar.

I give 10 out of 10 for this phenomenal movie.",10
"Struggling in despair, never giving up the new hope.How many people are satisfied with the status quo, but once they get out of that environment, they really despair?",10
"""Redemption of Shawshank"" is actually a kind of redemption of self. A life that pursues oneself is not just a dream, it is only how to do it yourself. Regardless of the outcome, this process is important.",10
"Beautiful film about captivity and hope that helps you survive, this movie is very hard and raw and hard and for this you stick to the screenfrom the beginning at the end, it's impossible to get bored, and the ending is fantastic ande is the fantastic conclusion of a very deep movie",10
The Shawshank Redemption is in my opinion the biggest best picture of all time. It one of the greatest and peaceful endings ever put on any screen. Every scene is masterful and styled so perfect that it feels like you care for this characters even though your not because they are in prison. It should be illegal for a movie to be this good.,10
"Hi,

I heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a friend. Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been shown but never saw it. A jail movie....slow..not for me.I was in college those days in the nineties.

In 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on. I replied back 'for me its rocky', he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not, the only answer he had was it..watch it and then compare it.

Now in 2009 with the recession going on, lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels, I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes.

I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends.

It was a shaking experience, and I got my answer....I needed to get out of my jail.

I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review, few had seen it already and many did not. Result, more people watched it...and guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie.

..AND i expect some of my friends also did it.

This is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit story....with more followers than fans.

I hope that answers some of your doubts......

This movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its important to get busy living.",10
"The film touches on the eternal themes of mankind and the unavoidable predicament of the present. The structure of the film is better than the original novel, the lines are more rhythmical, more refined and more profound than the original novel, and the characters are more vivid and powerful than the original novel. With rich and skillful artistic texts, the director will promote the spirit of freedom between heaven and earth.",9
"I actually does not have many things to say about this movie but,if I can say it that this movie is iconic I really meant that you know that this movie is a masterpiece.I actually want to do a review of this movie a long time ago but,I don't have time so when look at this IMDB site this movie stay one the top and I prefer it to be no 1 cause it is really an awesome movie.My rating 10/10",9
"I was recommended to watch this God-awful movie.I watched until the end. By God I wished I hadn't. It really was, undoubtedly, the most depressing film I have ever seen.",7
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is interesting. I found myself more interested in the personalities of Red and Andy more than the actual plot. The characters are the movie - they make up the plot. This movie creates an immersive setting or its audiences to brought in with its characters to the walls of Shawshank. In its genuine event simplicity, Shawshank instead focused the complexities of humans. My favorite character is Red, a man who seems to be fine viewing the world through an institutionalized lens. But that himself, makes him non-institutionalized - he has created his own identity within Shawshank which is nevertheless hard not to remember. Lastly my only critique is while Shawshank connects with reality by illustrating further upon the existential crisis facing many people within social institutions, Shawshank creates an overly fictional, less violent, more ideal prison that is not in touch with the current extremeties apparent in modern day prison systems.",10
"Such a delightful and suspenseful movie it was. Till date no prison break movie has been as awesome as TSR. Prison Break movie needs strong Story and Casting which it was solefully held tight in this movie. Best of best TSR still it didn't receive any oscars, it really brokes my faith for such academy awards.",10
"This is simply the best movie I have ever come across. It makes you ""stick with the movie"" from the beginning to the very last end. Especially the ending is great, but also the build up to it, the great acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

Definitely a must-see for everyone !!",8
"When I searched amongst the endless lists of reviews given about this movie, I had not found one that gave it less than 7 stars. In order to truly see a movie for what it is, one must look past all that makes it great into its minor flaws and weaknesses. If you (the reader) were drawn to this review because of the low rating, well I am sorry but I have mislead you. However, I have also led you to something greater and different from the rest of the reviews for this film.

To get to the point, Shawshank Redemption is magnificently made and deserves incredible amounts of praise for its entertainment value and perspective on life in prison. However, the themes of the film are rather shallow. The entire theme can be summarized in a short sentence: Friendship and hope can get you through almost anything. Although it is a great message, it is simply a nugget of what could have been much greater.

Now I know that I have only given the film 1 star here, but that was only to draw attention so that you may finally see that this film, although superb, is not perfect by any means as is suggested by the vast quantity of perfect reviews. In all honesty I would give it nine stars out of ten and would encourage everybody to see it.

Great, not perfect, but after all, where can true perfection honestly be found?",10
"Perfect story about life, hopes and freedom. Mr. Robbins and Freeman is great duo. Their characters trait are very attractive. The storyline bring us to watch them specifically and what will happen next. This film absolutely the greatest movie all of time.",10
The writing of this movie is great Loved this movie Worth watching,10
"This is masterpiece movie.one of the best ,worthwatching, one can only enjoy this by watching it.",9
Not sure what to say about this film. I'm no psychoanalyst or writer. I really liked the music (title and in film),9
"When I saw the film for the first time, I knew from the beginning that in order to better understand it, I had to watch it for the second time.

A combination of courage, hard work, freedom and humanity.",9
A very beautiful film with a narrator who tells the story in the most beautiful way possible.,9
Shawshank really surprised me. I didn't think any prison movie could shape up to Escape from Alcatraz but this one did! Tim Robbins gives a brilliant performance and the supporting cast shows no flaws. The ending will leave you begging for more. I recommend for everyone to see this great film.,10
"Based upon a novella written by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is unique in that its delivery is more effective as a motion picture than as a work of literature. Enter Andy Defresne- a man convicted of crimes that he did not commit. Such is his reality, and our deepest fear. Tim Robbins offers a stellar performance, depicting a realistic character weighed down by his situation, yet while in the presence of this adversity he does not abdicate hope. His tenacity is unparalleled, and is undoubtedly a characteristic to be admired, if not imitated. Accompanying this man?s quest is a case study of the corruption inherent in American corrective facilities. While many atrocities are brought to light, the resulting product is one of the most life affirming movies I have ever viewed as Andy eventually reaches his 'destination.'",10
"If you need to explain, what the hope is - just see the Shawshank Redemption... Stunning actor's play...",10
"A movie that changed millions of lives.

About a movie that talks about institutionalization. It it not just the redemption that redeem us from the ignorance but the very face of societies where we face in everyday's life that we don't acknowledge it normally. The redemption should be a redemption.",9
"This Shawshank Redemption is good to start for newbies. Everybody has to watch in life. The question for ask, whats the meaining life or where to be living?",10
"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The story is exciting, intriguing, and believable. That acting is some of the best I have ever seen and you really feel involved with characters. It really makes you think and is highly entertaining. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and his performance is once again mesmerizing. Its one of those movies you don't mind seeing over and over again. I loved it.",10
"When Batman takes his shirt off toward the beginning to the film, he has a large scar on his shoulder. The scar is gone later in the movie, when he appears shirtless while laying out the clues he's gathered on the Riddler case.",10

"There are many movies that will leave me wanting more. This movie was one of them. It is about a man, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins),who is sentenced to prison for life, for the murder of his wife and her lover. He then meets another inmate who is sentenced for life as well, Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman). Ellis, who has been there for about 30 years , befriends Andy and tells him about the way of life in the Shawshank Prison. I believe the choice of actors was superb. I think the movie would have gotten out of hand if Tim Robbins wasn't cast for the part of the soft-spoken Andy. There were parts in the movie that would have been completely ridiculous and impossible if he didn't take them and create a surrealism around it. As for Morgan Freeman, what can I say. His narraration was informative . He was also perfect for the role if Ellis. During the whole duration of the movie I couldn't find one part that he hesitated or he looked as if his emotions weren't for real. The plot is simply outstanding and the movie has a very clever and witty end. It is amazing how Frank Darabont was able to piece this movie together and create such a perfect end to a perfect movie. RATING ***** out of ****",10
"When I first got this movie I was never bothered to watch it. I first heard of it from my cousin who said it was ""so damn good"". I never watched it for two months but when I got seriously bored I just decided it was time. And boy was my cousin right. This film is damn good. Andy Dufrene is accused of murder due to circumstantial evidence which results in him being sent to shawshank. There he meets Red and his mates. Over the years they bond and share a powerful friendship. This film tells the triumph of the human spirit, and how hope is a good thing. The acting is top notch, direction and cinematography brilliant, and the soundtrack empathizes the film like no other can.

I seriously recommend this film to those that want to see a brilliant masterpiece.

9/10",10
"This movie is able to unlock much more perspectives when it comes to everything in general. Its a masterpiece and ashame that it didnt win a single oscar even though it most definitely deserved one. The ending was simple but yet so amazing. So many inspiring quotes and characters for us to look up to. The casting was mad incredible too, morgan served his role as if he was born for it. The whole build up was entertaining and useful. Everything just felt like finally finishing a puzzle that you've spent hours on. Nothing about this movie is out of place. Everything from front to end was a masterpiece.",10
"On reading the comments of others left on the page i was surprised. I would rate this as worthy of being 3rd in the top 250. The film may not be an action packed ride from start to finish as you may expect a jail break to be, but this is because it is not what the film is meant to be about. If you have read Kings original short story you will see that the adaptation of this film does it justice, as so many attempts of making films from his books have not, with the exception of stanly kubrick's adaptation of the shining. The acting by tim robbins and morgan freeman only adds to the prominence of this film in expressing the adversity that was suffered by prisoners back in the 40's.",10
"A film based on Stephen King's novella that rightly drew a global audience and a credit to all those involved.

A plot that was well set out and professionally engineered to maximum effect, Frank Darabont again laying out new ground rules for others to follow.

A story of Andy Dufresne sentenced to a term in Shawshank Prison for murder, a shame such a good film received such poor ratings from the press. the film was a masterpiece and so deserved the multiple Oscar nominations.

With such a great line up including Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, David Proval, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolston, James Whitmore, Jeffrey DeMunn, Larry Brandenburg, Neil Giuntoli, its no wonder this fill many years after its launch is still drawing audiences. a job well done",10
"For a prison movie, it focuses a lot on heart and wholesomeness. By the end of the film, you really feel for the characters. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" brilliantly weaves a narrative of hope amidst a bleak setting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances that resonate deeply, portraying friendship and resilience. The cinematography captures the essence of the penitentiary while highlighting the human spirit's triumph over adversity. The storyline is compelling, making you ponder the concept of redemption and the power of perseverance. The only reason it falls shy of a perfect score is due to some pacing issues in the middle act. Nonetheless, this film is a cinematic gem that lingers in your thoughts long after the credits roll.",10
"Best movie ever , if you're looking for perfection , this is it.

Freedom at its best, Morgan Freeman its formidable.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, there is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth.",10
This has to be my favourite film from a Steven King novel and one of my all time top ten. The story is fantastically told and the acting brilliant-a real credit to one of the best stories for a long time. I wont spoil the storyline for anyone who wasn't watched it but suffice to say you will not be disappointed.,10
"'The Shawshank Redemption' is based heavily upon Stephen King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' - adapted for screen by Writer/Director Frank Darabont (screenwriter for 'The Fly II' and 'Indiana Jones 4.') Since this film has graced the silver screen, Darabont has also adapted King's 'The Green Mile' and 'The Majestic' with great success. This has truly sparked off a trend of King adaptations such as 'Night Flier,' 'Hearts in Atlantis' and 'Dream Catcher.' In this film an innocent man is wrongly accused of the murder of his wife and her lover, and imprisoned in 'Shawshank Prison' for two life-terms. Within the prison walls (some stronger than others) the enigma unravels as 'Andy Dufresne' (Tim Robbins - 'Arlington Road') meets extraordinary people with the gift of 'seeing hope through the bars,' such as 'Red' (Morgan Freeman - 'Dreamcatcher') who tells Andy to ""Get bust living - or get busy dying."" Under the harsh conditions in which Andy's love for reading, music and friendship are exploited (sentencing him to the light-devoid 'hole') he uses all his skill and logic to conduct a plan unlike any other - escape and exploit 'Warden Norton' (Bob Gunton - 'Patch Adams') and start living again.

This film is successful due to the simplistic (yet ideal) cinematography, the splendid acting, the real emotion and the fact that Darabont employs many of the same cast his other films ('The Green Mile' and 'The Majestic') - generating a wonderful, intimate atmosphere between the cast. This film seems like a much-loved, family project - rather than a faceless Hollywood production...",10
"Without exaggeration, I have seen this movie for more than 100 times in past 6 years.

What makes Shawshank the best movie of all time in Cinema is the simplicity in which the story has been told. From beginning to end, not only you see different beautiful characters in the movie living their life in a prison, but you start to live it with them for the entire duration. Every single emotion and characteristic of humans have been touched, right from love, lust, anger, frustration, corruption, guilt, friendship, redemption and most importantly the HOPE.

This is one of the most motivating films of all time. I doubt there has been any single viewer, who watched the movie and didn't feel happy at the end. I prefer watching Shawshank every time I have had a bad phase in life. The film will just fill your heart with warmth and make you feel good about life in general about how there is always a light after the end of the tunnel, no matter how long the tunnel is, but only if you hope for it and don't give up.

Have you seen the mime saying 'I want Morgan Freeman to narrate my life'? Well this movie is the primary reason for that.

Without doubt this deserves the #1 spot on top 250 list !!",9
I saw this movie about a week ago and I really enjoyed it. I also have the movie and I've seen it about three or four times. It was also on TV. Morgan Freeman was terrific as Red. I think that everybody should watch this movie. 10/10,10
"This movie was clearly the best movie I've ever seen. I watched it because it was number 1 on IMDb. Turns out my favorite movies like the return of the king, Forrest Gump, or the dark night didn't even come close to it. Why can't movie directors now days make such a good movie like this anymore? I would definitely recommend people to watch this if you like serious movies or meaningful movies. But if your the type of person who has ADHD and can't stand watching a talking scene for 10 seconds, i wouldn't recommend this to you. I would warn you that this is a long movie and it's not meant to watch it in birthday parties unless if your friends are all nerds or serious people. Also don't let your parents see it because there are many swear words in it, with some violence and almost a gay sex-scene. Other wise this movie is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10
"Based on the Stephen King Short Story, This movie, a prison story is a unique tale of a man wrongfully placed in prison, who was married and wife murdered by someone else. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins plays the lead parts and makes this a movie worth seeing.",10
"This movie is THE classic. It is a beautiful, well thought, captivating drama that really touches you. It is no surprise that's the number 1 by many reviewers and ultimately #1 in the IMDb Top 250.

The plot is rather simple : a man is accused for committing a crime which he did not take part in. That being said , the movie tells his life in the prison , thorough the eyes of another character, Red, portrayed by Morgan Freeman..

One can ask how this basic, modest story , can be so astonishing.

One of the things that contribute to this magic title , is the rather humble , very human way that the main character acts . Although injusticed, he manages to keep his head cool , and makes everything he can to aid his and their fellas life better , with the help of elementary things like a cigarette , a beer or even a book.

The story is told with a perfect and quiet pace, guided by the words of Freeman - they transmit a sense of understanding, calming and wisdom sense that follows through until the very end of the movie.

In result, the Shawhank Redemption is the perfect ride - delivers everything one could want and yet arises meaningfully questions concerning the purpose and ways of life , that one should not just ignore.",10
"I can't say enough about this film its simply the King of Kings when it comes to movies.Other movies might have something better, but put all the contents of a great movie together and this one hast is all Narration, acting, humour, direction, story, suspense, soundtrack...the full package.Its a powerful movie and I don't know how you can keep your emotions in check with such a intense story. Its a tragedy this didn't win an Oscar for best picture over Forrest Gump...for me there isn't many movies that possess the overall strength of this movie, hence why its still #1 in on IMDb and top 5 on many other reputable internet sites.",10
This movies is a masterpiece. 10/10 will watch again.,10
"Maybe the highest rated prison movie ever... that represents a term that's a bit overused called 'Freedom'. The thing that we sure need in every moment, when someone is takin' it away we always feel it, but here is so direct and sensetive, so we can sense so much empathy for the unlucky bankar, who lost his wife and freedom in so short period. The whole cast, i won't comment.. everyone did a marvelous job. And there's happy ending for a reason a think, 'cause hope is never a thing to give up, if u give up hope, u will get Institutionalized, and quickly when out of prison u have nothing to live for, it definitly gets deep into the prisoners mind, so it will stay as one of the films i always love to watch now and than, definitly a classic.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption is right up there with my favourite movies. Its probably the best deep story example of a movie that I like.

The film is a touching tale of the dehumanizing effects of a life in prison, a modern version of which can be seen on HBO's Oz. I digress, the first time I saw this movie, I was actually touched by the story.

I began to feel crappy for Andy, I understood Red's bitterness, disgusted when Andy crawled out the crap pipe. The movie tells a very very powerfully depressing story, but to keep the watcher from getting mad has an amazingly uplifting ending, that makes the story seem worth it.

Amazing, enough said.",10
"The criteria for a classic film to become timeless is very simple. It must speak to every generation that comes in contact with it. Films like the The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, both which were released in 1939, have obviously aged well. The Wizard of Oz, like The Shawshank Redemption, was not an immediate success and yet it grew an audience. The Shawshank Redemption is a well told story that seems to connect with people on a basic level. It has also subsequently grown in viewership in its first decade. It will be very interesting to see how it fares 50 years from now. Will this film stand the test of time? Will this film always remain a favorite among audiences?",10
A very good description about a realistic film. Long will be in the first place,10
"Quite simply amazing.

This film makes you question yourself, authority, friendship and injustice all at once. The quality of the acting is brilliant, and what a storyline. Although set in the past it is a storyline that could run for centuries. I have watched this film probably 10-15 times and each time enjoy it as much as the last. An easy watch, and although far fetched is still believable somewhat.

Absolute entertainment from start to finish, and on a relatively low budget. It just shows that a simple idea for a screenplay can be adapted into a classic. Many films fail when they make twists too complicated, or use too many special effects. This film allows the viewer to make their own decisions but also gently pushes you into making a connection with each and every character

My favourite film by a country mile.",10
"The best thing about this movie is that it does not contain a single flaw. You can enjoy this movie throughout without getting bored for a minute. Excellent dialog delivery. The most important thing i liked in this movie is the casting.Each character in the movie makes a specific impression on the viewer. You don't find any of the character as redundant. The at the start somewhat resembles to the Clint Eastwood Starred ""Escape from Alcatraz"" at start but then the movie takes you to altogether different tour. Despite of absence of Eastwood's charisma ""The Shawshank redemption"" is leaps and bounds ahead of ""Escape from Alcatraz"". Morgan Freeman delivers again by his impeccable narration.The dialogs just wake up your soul, and if not then the solid background music does the trick.Over the years this movie has been my standard to which i compare all other movies. Till now i have not found any movie which matches such perfection. I just ""HOPE"" that some day i will see a movie better than this one.A must watch movie for everyone. Watch this movie and you will be a better person with changed attitude towards life.",10
"This movie well deserves to be the most top rated movie in the history of cinema. Everything about this movie is top-notch. Acting, script, music, etc.

It just saddens me that nowadays we don't see movies of this quality anymore.",10
"I don´t like movies about ""way of life"" or about a hope. In this movie is handled a problem with ""normal life"" or with resolution to take a life to ""own hands"". A topic of this film is such like Papillon. This is not an authentic subject, this is not an authentic movie....",10
"No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never get over it. A genuine and absolute outlook on life and death, freedom and captivity, friend and foe. A perfect score is what the Shawshank Redemption will always deserve. Its idea will never die.",10
Everyone should watch it. Especially students and upcoming artists.,10
Just watch it. In fact. You will probably want to watch it again and again,9
"I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

A must watch if you haven't!!!",10
"simply the best movie ever made. this movie embraces the philosophy that justice will be done, karma is heard and that goodness will rule above anything in this world. Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but certainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true character. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he will be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats Andy like the lowest of the low. In the meantime Reds parole is continuously declined, and they both have to re-adjust, even though their life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of freedom. Will the time really come, and if yes...are they ready for it?",8
"This film gave me a great feeling at the end. My mother thought it wouldn't be my typical everyday action movie, I saw the recommendations and had a look at it. I was amazed, and so was my mum. At the end I saw her on the edge of her seat yelling at Morgan Freeman to do what Tim Robbins had said.

I recommend this movie very much. It is a sad, funny at times and it is most importantly, Heart warming. For those of you that haven't seen it I tell you now, this is the best movie of the Nineties.

Just another thing, I saw Forrest Gump and that was not as good as this. The Shawshank Redemption should have won the Oscars!",9
"This is possibly the best film ever made. Everything from the script and acting to the camera work and set are remarkable. Based on a Stephen King novella, it is easily the best adaption from a written story ever put to film. Tim Robbin's certainly deserved an Oscar for this film, his performance was moving yet not overpowering. Even though the audience is left out of the story in certain parts, we still feel strongly for his character Andy Dufresne. Morgan Freeman is perfect, even though he's not the Irishman that was intended for the role. He narrates the film with ease and we connect to his character as if we were a part of the movie. Frank Darabont, director of the film, allowed us to feel what Andy was feeling through the use of small stories and camera shots. The immensity of the prison can be felt instantly from our first viewing. The connection the audience makes to the film as a whole makes The Shawshank Redemption what it is: one of the best films ever made.",10
"Every family has a film they watch together on a regular basis or for a special occasion/ holiday. Hoosiers and The Shawshank Redemption are the ones for my family. I'm sure I've seen this marvelous film at least 100 times since I was ten. This film reminds us that motion pictures still have the power to make us laugh, cry or look at ourselves from a new point of view. This is one of those rare films that makes you proud to be alive. Andy's struggles and redemption show us that hope is a beautiful thing and it never dies. My personal favorite scene in the entire film is Andy's crawl through 300 yards of sewage to freedom. The shot of his victory in which he stands in the rain with open arms embracing freedom is one of the most powerful and beautiful shots ever caught on film. I get tears of joy every time I see it. All in all, this is a remarkable film that like hope, will live forever. rating: 10/10

"My 1st inspirational movie.(2002)

It's based on a ""STEPHEN KING"" Novel. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.

The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. Great movie in 90s'...",10
"Roger Ebert's review about this film:

It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.

Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.",10
"Wow! The general reaction to this movie. Frank Darabont brought Steven King's Short story to a whole new light. The cast as well as the general look of this film that makes is the classic that it is. Andy Dufrain (Tim Robbins) is accused and convicted of murdering his fiancé and her lover. Andy, the big city banker that was out of place immediately strikes a cord in Red (Morgan Freeman). The two form a relationship after a bet that didn't cash out for Red. The tale of Andy and his terrible beginnings at the Shawshank Prison is unsettling. Tim Robbin's look and performance is superb! His soft,smart demeanor is painted well. His relationship with Red is the meat of the film. Andy's defiant yet peaceful persona slowly mends in with the rest of the prisoners. The story couldn't have been told better. Morgan Freeman is the actor we know now because of this role. His dedication to his friend is undying. The thought of relationships like that make this movie so watchable. The fact that you can watch this over and over and not be distracted is it's own note. Most who collect movies have this title as a part of their collection. The story will be timeless because of the movie and cement Stephen King as not only a great Novelist but, amazing screenwriter. Everyone should watch this movie. The different feelings it invokes as well as the mystery that comes with the story are worth the Hour plus you spend. The problem is that the blueprints for movies like this aren't able to be written. That's why classics like this are far and few. Cinephiles would agree that the ""Shawshank Redemption"" is placed well at #1 on IMDb'S List.",10
This is a normal average movie . People are just hyped because it is in #1 . And I don't think those people have seen a lot of movies . It's way too much overrated in my opinion . My honest rating would be 7/10,1
"I love Morgan Freeman and have been to the Mansfield reformatory once. It was closed for the season. This Prison, has been used in multiple movies. Anyhow, back to the rating. I give it a 10, i love movies with a narrative setting. Also, loved the fact that he was in prison for a crime that he didn't commit, and he was able to have posters, especially of Rita hayworth in his cell. I didn't particularly, care for the SISTER'S theme, but I do know it happens in prisons, so i can appreciate the set-up for that scenario. I love how Tim Robbins character, developed a relationship with a younger guy so he could mentor him, and then he got killed by the warden's guards. I also loved the ending, when he got revenge on the Warden, and was able to escape with all of the warden's money. Best classic Movie!!! I do end up not watching the Sister's scenario, but other than that this is truly, one of the best classic movies EVER.",10
"This movie should be added as a syllabus for students of film.

Everything is great, the direction, acting, the works! A brutally honest look at hope, which is just inside the realm of possibility.

This makes you want to take life in a better spirit than you already do.

Should be shown to young adults to teach them the value of patience, which is something that's going out of fashion in this era of 'everything online'.

There's something to be said about Stephen King. . . he may not be the best writer, but he is definitely the best storyteller.",8
"Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, where after watching are happy you invested your time in. The story line is simple, but the way it is made is terrific. You instantly root for Andy, the main character because he so likable. Upon watching this film there was so much hype around it, and I had to know why. Many famous scenes are recreated in other movies, and you will understand and respect the depth of it. Morgan Freeman gives a performance of a lifetime as per usual, and creates a wonderful film alongside Tim Robbins and other cast members. Frank Darabont clearly wanted to go out a create a masterpiece, and truly succeeded. There is no way this film can ever be forgotten, see for yourself.",10
"Seen this one a couple of times, never fails to disappoint. Erm, top 10 all time.

T_ dogs reviews",10
"I did not think the adjectives would be inadequate to tell some masterpieces, but it really happened. I'm a bit tired of movies, actually. I did not give much. I do not have a lot of movies to watch, but I've never met a movie that I can perfectly appreciate. However, I was surprised at my self, when I gave this movie 10 times when the first hour of this film was not full. Perhaps the beauty that has been able to get rid of the wonderfulness of all sorts of embarrassment has affected me. Maybe I'm in a place where I'm laughing, somewhere I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm surprised. Maybe he could move all my senses. Maybe I saw the father of the child who dropped his ice cream to the end because of his cute grace, and he said, ""Do not be sad, my son, I am bigger than you,"" saying that he loved his child and had a childlike happiness as if he were his own father. Neither my folks are such a fascinating experience, it's been a long time, and it's this crazy feeling. The film is also written for me because I have just watched it without being overwhelmed by the influence and the spell. I smile without my hands and I think it's time to give me your notes now.",10
"... I've watched this movie ... I've cried at the end of this movie (would match the number of times watched) ... Left behind whatever I was doing or watching beforehand if it comes on tv.

It's just a great movie. Wonderful acting, wonderful script. Great score. Not a thing out of place for me. It's impossible not to get completely absorbed.",10
Best Direction and Story Ever. Loved the Performance of Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman. Really A Mind Blowing Movie.,9
"What an amazing movie.....Held me astonished for a long time.....what an acting by Tim Robbins....Best part surely was when Andy flee out that hell....Psychologically perfect.....I wonder why this movie has no Oscar....This is such a masterpiece..no one will witness for a long long time...How beautifully it expresses the life in a prison and reminds of bluffers who are way way ahead of our system of security and justice....Nevertheless, Andy is someone which probably don't exist in real life but someone you will remember for your whole life...someone whose intelligence and determination will leave you clueless..Good dialogues BTW....Hope is best of the things....Some birds are never meant to be caged,there features are just too bright for it...n many more",10
This movie one of the best movie in my life. This film greatest film in the history.,10
I don't know what to say about this movie. Its brilliant masterpiece you just need to watch and feel it,10
"A white collar audience identifies with Andy, and fantasizes that if *they* ended up in prison, they too would be able to rise to the top among all the low-lifes and defeat the system, hatching a brilliant plot not only to escape, but escape rich *and* settle scores.

It's entertaining and satisfying, but at the same time, the prison and prisoners are too sanitized, and the guards too 1d and stereotypically evil.

And the coincidental thunderstorm, keeping a suit clean, pressed, and odor-free in a plastic bag tied with a rope in a sewer for all that time, and the complete absence of suspicion from a dozen banks, is a little too implausible.",10
Alot of people say that there is nothing wrong with sitting down and enjoying a movie. But there comes a movie that ticks all the boxes and more something that is almost impossible and should be. Every actor does his character like a champion I could see every person become a real life person never happens.,10
Best movie ever 👌 Amazing actors they should still be getting awards for this movie.,10
"This film is a little bit overrated, but is still one of the greatest stories EVER told, and has one of the greatest conclusions I have ever seen in a film.",10
I can't add very much to the previous descriptions and praise of this movie; I just want to say that it deserves its #1 standing at IMDb and I hope it holds that place forever. A brilliant film that speaks to the humanity in all of us.,10
"This movie reminds us how powerful hope is. ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""",10
"This is the second best movie ever, with only ""Heat"" beating it out. Stephen King is a great writer, this being the second best novella in ""Different Seasons,"" ""Apt Pupil"" being the best of the four stories(I haven't seen the movie yet). Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins work well together, and Thomas Newman's original music is great. ""Hope Springs Eternal.""",10
"This is an example that Hollywood CAN do a great movie that doesn't solely build on special effects.

This is also a proof that not all movies need to have more ""pace"" or ""action"". The ingredients in this movie is the interaction between two great actors, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, a very good support cast, a superb story by Stephen King and a professional crew. This ""soup"" is very tasteful and gets 10/10 by me.",8
"For a long time now I had seen this movie move up the IMDb ladder and make its way to becoming #1, I was a bit irritated being that it took the spot of ""The Godfather"" however, this was before I had ever laid my eyes on even a trailer for this film, so I researched through the credits and found out that it was based on a novel by one of my favorite writers ""Stephen King"", I know what your thinking, how could he be one of my favorite writers if I didn't even have a clue about this Masterpiece. July 24, 2010 was my movie day, I promised myself I was going to stay up 24 Hours watching some of my favorite Films, I started of at around 12:45 with the controversial, sadistic, genius, masterpiece that is ""A Clockwork Orange"", then after my brain was through with Ultra-Violence I proceeded watching the best sequel ever made in the History of cinema ""The Godfather Part II"", then after I felt like a Corleone I started watching the Coen Brothers Masterpiece ""No Country For Old Men"", then after feeling lost I started watching ""Pulp Fiction"" and after that the time was around 4:30 P.M. and I broke my promise to myself and took what I thought was going to be a 2 Hour Nap which turned into a 6 Hour Intermission, I woke up around 10:00 deciding which movie I was going to watch and I wanted it to be a Classic I had never seen, I was thinking ""12 Angry Men"" but for some reason I wanted to see what the all this fuss was about when it came to Shawkshank Redemption"" so I rented it and started watching around 11:45 P.M., Let me just say after this movie left an Impact in my Life and Mind, I now actually know why it is #1 on this site and it is for good reason, this movie made me laugh hysterically at times like in ""Animal House"", it made me think like ""Fight Club"" does at times, it made me frightened like ""The Shining"" at times and I have no other movie to reference my Sobbing emotions with because no other film has made me Cry, and that should tell you that after a day of Great Films this one had the biggest Impact on me.",10
"You must see this movie. Great plot, awesome acting. I can't believe it didn't win an Oscar. It should have beaten Gump that year.",10
"Years ago I decided to start collecting Stephen King paperback editions (and reading them, too) to prop up my excellent English. I'd found out that in the horror genre, everything that had something to do, had the label 'Stephen King' or 'John Carpenter' on it. Luckily both (as in 'Cat's Eye). But as I introduced myself with Mr. King's works I found out that the Enchantment in it isn't in the gore (which he describes splendidly, meaning that I can smell the rottening human flesh despite the fact that my nose exists only for cosmetical reasons) but the professional skill to tell a story. King gets paid by the page, so nowadays he's apt to write stories up to three bricks thick before his eyes wear out. Luckily, his best stories to be filmed are the ones that don't need 'overwriting',nor 'overfilming' as in mini-TV-series as 'The Stand', 'Golden Years', and so on. The best way for Stephen King to make an original story for a movie seems to be to: 1) keep it compact and 2) stay out of intestines, awkward smells and anything that comes out of your body when you're dead). We saw 'Stand by me me' already and 'Dolores Claiborne' afterwards, but this is the upmost number one. When King tells a little story in size of a novelette with no hurry at all, there should be nothing to add. But: then comes the movie with its more than perfect casting plus the original serenity maintained! I conclude my speech with saying that no other movie ever has collected full 10 points, horror or not.",10
"I read Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption as part of Stephen King's Different Seasons, and loved the story.. to see just how much one person can go through, and not only remain sane, but keep his morals about him, even in the purgatory of a corrupt prison. The book was incredible. But the movie took it one step further, with incredibly well chosen actors and a beautiful sense of the book that is hard to set to a movie, as well as lines that I still remember at the drop of a hat. Incredible, and one of my favorite movies of all time.",10
"After seeing this movie for the first time I was stunned. Living in Maine i was very interested in the whole story. The prison featured in the movie is very similar to our own Thomaston State prison. This is not just a good movie, but a great story as well. It keeps you wanting to see Andy set free throughout the whole thing.",10
"That's my feeling when I finished reading the novel recently. Frank Darabont obviously made a lot of major modifications. The ending scene is one of them. Forrest Gump is good. Pulp Fiction is good too. But this movie is even better. And I'm glad that I saw it in the theater, not on the videotape.",10
"This is the film I always heard people talk about but never saw.

Until now. I must say, it does fulfil my expectations. It has been

brilliantly directed, the actors have done a wonderful job and

the story is perfect. I recommend it to everybody.

But... yes there is a but, I thought it just missed a little

something. That's the reason I gave it a 9 instead of a 10. This

film is a product of craftmanship, but it isn't art. And this is

what makes a film truly great. Everything has been put in the

right place, but it misses some originality, some magic touch.

It's a brilliant movie, but it doesn't compare to other movies

like American Beauty or American History X, which truly change

your way of thinking.",7
"I didnt need IMDB or anything else to tell me if Shawshank is a good or bad movie. This is one of those movies you will never forget and i have watched it five or six times and everytime the film gets to me, and thats why i consider this a masterpeice. You cant get better acting then this..",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the best film of the 90's. And probably the most beautiful film ever. For a long time I thought Pulp Fiction was the best of the two, but as time goes by I've learned Shawshank is the better.

This is a film that will be remembered and loved for all-time. It doesn't matter if you see this movie today, next week or in 10 years time from now. It will always have this effect on people it has right now. It took a while for audiences to really appreciate this film, because they didn't understand that ""hope is a good thing"", but knew that ""life was like a box of chocolates and didn't know what we're going to get"" later that year.

""Hype is a bad thing, maybe the worst of things""

The only bad thing I can think about is the dutch translation for the novel by Stephen King which is ""De Ontsnapping"" and I'm NOT going to translate it for all those who haven't seen it yet, cause it gives away the final twist.

I hope more and more people will love this film. I hope films like this will be made. I hope

Rating 10/10",9
"What a fantastic movie! Tim Robbins gave the best performance I have ever seen by an actor and Morgan Freeman was excellent, also. There are some unbelievably moving scenes in this film. I foolishly passed it by at the theater and at the video store. When I saw it on cable for the first time, I realized it was a truly special movie. Why? I could not put my finger on it until I read the summary on the video box in the store. It really is a triumph of the human spirt with a tremendously satisfying ending. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it will be added to my collection this Christmas!",10
"An experience you'll gonna remember forever.I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.",10
"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched to date. It has everything. Humour, emotions and a great story.",10
"Before watching this film,I read few quotes just to add them in my diary. Then I found the quote ""Hope is a good thing may be the best of all things"". I came to know that this is from the film Shawshank redemption . I started watching it. First, at the beginning,the film started with a different tone. I thought this film is going to be something about Deception,fights etc but I was wrong. It's outstanding and everyone not only film lovers but everyone likes this film. Some emotional scenes made me cry and I couldn't feel bore. I was in a journey. In journey, not to make myself feel bored, I watched this film. And after completion,I watched this again. But at last I mean the whole movie is aside a d last 45 minutes is another side. Those 45 minutes were nerve bending. The background score was awesome. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's acting is next level. All the actors Bob gunton and others have given an incredible performance. I don't know why this one couldn't get Oscars. But one thing...if you have a watch list , edit those list by putting this at top. My sincere thanks to the Movie crew for giving this masterpiece",9
Best direction Best performance Best camera Best music Best cast Overall best story and script 😍😍😍😍😍😍,10
One of the best movies ever made it was so good and i feel bad for myself that I am making a review 26 years late because i watched this movie yesterday for the first time and it's a masterpiece,10
"As the title says, this is The Greatest Movie Ever! All actors play their parts perfect, the dialog is perfect, the plot is perfect, the endning is perfect. In short a perfect Steven King Movie. A must watch.",10
"This is a true masterpiece, the film successfully built a miniature society in prison and the way old society operates. When corrupt officials push innocent people into a sinful path, the film especially honors the strength of the protagonist's friendship and the determined determination. This is definitely a masterpiece you must watch once in a lifetime. .",10
"This film is one that I consider under-appreciated. It captures the essence of human nature, in every one of its 142 minutes. Fear, humanity, love, anger and courage are just a few emotions and traits shown on film in this masterpiece. In the IMDB top250 films, it comes third behind Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Godfather. While good films in their own league, they don't compare to the magnificence of The Shawshank Redemption.

'Shawshank' is set in America in the 1950s-70s. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne, who is sent to Shawshank Prison for a double murder, that of his wife and her lover. The film shows us the relationships he develops with fellow prisoners, especially of that with Red, real name Ellis Boyd Redding. Tim Robbins' gentle, yet powerful portrayal of Andy touches the heart of the viewer and makes him likeable. Morgan Freeman should have won the Oscar for which he was nominated for portraying Red, the man who 'can get things'. He is a charming character that makes you want to see this film at least once more, and many of his lines stick in the memory. For instance, when Andy tells Red he wants him to get Rite Hayworth for him, Red tells him he'll try his best. Andy is still unsure, until 'I don't have her down my pants right now, Andy, but I'll get her for you!' If you have never seen 'The Shawshank Redemption', go down to the nearest video shop and rent it. No, don't rent it, BUY it. It'll be the best few quid you ever spend on entertainment. Stacy_G_",10
This movie is the best from all the movies ever!!!!,10
"one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. A film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifer's existence might feel like. Thoroughly gripping, and pretty refreshing. Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a low-key prison film that didn't recoup its costs. Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been life- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.",10
"I have a rather small film collection, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the movies that is a part of it. This film is done beautifully, from the soundtrack to the acting. I'm no film critic, so I'll leave the in-depth reviews to those who are more capable, but I will say that if you haven't seen this film, make the trip to the video store.

I give it a 10.",10
"It's just sweet, classic and one of the best movies ever... that's all I can say About out this...",10
"This movie is fantastic in it's build up and execution of what finally happens. With Andy and red going through so much, for both of them on their own to get redemption. In that it also points out an excellent point for the crappy us prison system, which only institutionalizes criminals. And makes you see the flaw of their failure to rehabilitate people. In this movie the acting is expressive and realistic from most people, but natural as something based off Steven king, the antagonist and alot of other bad characters come off as 2d and dry in terms of emotion, over the course of the film you get to see the warden in more depth, but the rest you don't besides maybe a quick glimpse into their life through dialog, which is an extremely strong point of this film. I feel all the conversation are written very well, and even reds narration is written very well if not a bit cliche. The story is very slow, and paints a beautifully sad picture of all of it throughout the course. And the story on its own is a really powerful one, which is a great combination with actually having been well done. The sets are great, of course as it almost exclusively takes place in one location. But even outside they're convincing. The way this movie presents back stories I can't feel if it's good or bad, but I like it and it's very unique. The music in this movie is extremely simple, but does it effectively. And the rest of the sound design is done fine too. The acting of red, Andy, Tommy, haywood, the warden, and brooks are all very fantastic performances. They all feel like real humans. And I feel like this could be a study of humans, it shows everything in so much detail while not being super long it's impressive. The ending is just iconic, and is one of the best endings for a movie. The long narration of what happens after while showing is so well done. This movie feels very grounded into reality which makes the satisfaction by the end all the more satisfying.

The camerawork in this movie isn't the best, but feels effective and never feels like it isn't conveying the mood or theme.

Overall though; even though I don't feel like it's the best movie ever, it's a fantastically written, with very efficient music and timing. And is a must see to anyone who likes good movies. Overall a 8.7/10 from me.",10
"FINALLY! A site that got it right. The ranking on this couldn't be more accurate. A wonderful movie that never once feels slow, pointless, overdone, or simply, bad. It does everything right, and is a crime that this had to go up against Forrest Gump in the same year, and a shame it was so overlooked.

What we have here is a masterpiece of film, something that just makes you feel better leaving the theater than you did going in. It builds up to a man's ultimate triumph over wrong, and the best BEST ending of a film ever.

Perfect, as has been stated by 99.9% of people here. Because it is.

If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this (for shame!), to quote will Ferrel: ""Go immediately to where ever movies are made-, sold or rented, and watch it. It is delightful""",10
"In sixteen years, he has never given up hope in the face of countless desperate situations.Even if that hope is likely to fail.",10
"This is a film without love and beauty, but it deeply touched my heart.Hope is good thing, and maybe the best thing of all.The hero's desire for freedom allowed him to overcome everything. When he succeeded in breaking out of prison, I cried too.",10
"This is a film that can be studied in film school as it's built with originality and classic narrative structure.

It's film that everyone may like as it dig in the quest for liberty and dignity that we all look for.",10
"Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.",10
"This is quite a story, and the film does an incredible job of telling it. The acting is magnificent, and the quality of the direction makes this film a pleasure to watch. A great film for the human spirit, and the importance of freedom to our well-being. I voted 10/10 for Shawshank.",10
"I liked this movie when I first time watched it but it was never my ""the best"" movie. Then I happened to watch it again and ever since it is by far the most enjoyable movie i have seen.

Andy(Tim Robbins) is a true social spirit. It was after Andy's(Tim Robbins) hundreds of letters that was sent to the authorities requesting funds for the prison's library that they at lastcsent the fund with the words ""Please stop sending us letters"". He teaches a fellow inmate to get degree. It was the same student who told Andy about a man he knew who has killed Andy's wife (for this crime Andy was in the Shawshank Prison). The Warden could not let Andy go as he was his key to financial success. From that moment Andy was committed to take revenge. And he did it.

Every second of this movie is spectacular. It is the best movie I have ever seen and heard of! Enjoy every word of it!",10
Look people can say that this movie is not the best ever made but I strongly disagree it makes you cry it makes you laugh and in the end you just think wow. Everyone in this movie has amazing performances Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really show there acting chops and it is just great. I don't think anyone could watch this and say it was bad everyone's first reaction is wow. This movie holds up great and it will be many decades before there is a movie better,9
"I LOVE the Shawshank Redemption. It gives the story of a prison inmate in his many years at an institution. This movie is so great, I cried in the middle of it! When Brooks dies has got to be the saddest moment in movie history. I cried for a good 10 minutes. He let his bird go, and he took his life. Very sad stuff. It's great how they start up a library helping the illiterate inmates. It shows some of the atrocites that inmates go through even if they are innocent. A VERY GREAT movie and probably the best of all time. I give it an A++++++.",10
Must watch movie..this movie give you a great message.. nd the acting was super of the Morgan Freeman..,10
"This is my 1st review on IMDb , i don't like writing reviews for a movie after all it's just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon, well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like Morgan free-man you'll love of him after this one.... GREAT MOVIE... used to wonder why is it so highly rated.... well after seeing it.... i don't want to let the rating fall so i added mine and given it what it deserves...and i hope it remains at the top... i would like to thank the film maker and the production as a fan for a wonderful experience i got after seeing this movie :)",10
"The message of this film is hope. This film is made on hope. And that's why it will never die, it will live on forever. Based on a short story by horror master Stephen king, it was directed like no film before. At the time no one cared for it, pulp fiction and Forrest Gump had just come out and no one cared about this film. But then it became what it is today. A masterpiece, most people say the godfather is the best film ever. No! The godfather isn't half the film shawshank is.",8
An amazing movie to watch if you have some time. 10/10.,10
"This movie is excellent. That is the best word to describe this movie. Tim Robbins was in top form as Andy who claims innocence to the criminal charge of murder and Morgan Freeman was very believable as Andy's friend, Red. I found this film to be very real yet at the same time it had a layer of magic to it. The characters were all very interesting to watch, some warm and brotherly, others frightening and souless. Even though I am female, I felt a kinship to Andy and found myself in his corner routing for him the whole time. He did not fail those of us that were watching. A definate in my personal top ten.",10
"This is wonderful filmmaking filled with gut-wrenching emotion and drama. I do not agree that this is the 2nd greatest movie of all time. Perhaps it belongs in the top 50. This film as well as Director Frank Darabont's follow-up The Green Mile are based on Stephen King short stories and I honestly cannot say that one is better than the other. Masterful direction, acting, and storytelling. I am very, very particular about the films that I give a perfect score. I go for more thought-provoking plots rather than well-told melodramas like Titanic. This is certainly an excellent film with its triumph of the human spirit theme and I believe that it is worthy of a 9. Excellent film experience. ****1/2 / *****",10
One of the greatest films of not just the the 90's. But since film it's self everything about this movie is great. The story is phenomenal the characters are incredibly well written and the actors put their souls into them.,10
"a movie that gives you a different view of inmates in prison.

it gives you a feel of satisfaction, and of true justice, and friendship.

i've watched this movie at least 8 times, and enjoyed it every time i did.

its a movie that makes you cry- only so you'll appreciate the moments where it makes you smile.

i don't want to ruin this wonderful movie for the rest of you guys, but ill just say, its one of those movies, that you just love and remember forever.",10
"Not even the best within the prison genre itself. After all the positive comments I heard, I was waiting for some fantastic ending or deep philosophic message to come through. Neither did. The ending turns out to be as clichéd and predictable as most other movies in the genre. For those who like prison movies, just go and watch some A&E's investigative reports on American penal system. They are way more realistic and gut wrenching than this film and they are free.

On the other hand, let us not be too cynical either. It's obvious that a lot of good work have been put into this film. Morgan Freeman's work alone is worth the money of the movie. The other highlight is Mozart's music over the intercom, which completely captivate the inmates. The scene is deeply philosophical and the music therapeutic. But still, it is somewhat unbelievable, as how many prison inmates really dig Mozart? If they did, they probably wouldn't have ended up behind bars in the first place. But hey this is Hollywood.

It's not a must see movie unless you have never seen a prison film before. But it is an entertaining one to kill some time for a Friday night when you have run out of things to do. So for my money, it is worth 7/10.",10
"There a few films that I have ever felt honoured to watch, and the Shawshank Redemption is one of them. Freeman and Robbins give career-defining performances. Really, I can only say - go out and rent it now. This is a truly inspirational film",9
"The Shawshank Redemption was story about how perseverance, hope and innocence will change a man's destiny. Tim Robbins was eloquent and portrayed a character with acting prowess of razor sharp perfection. Wrongly accused of murdering his wife, he ends up in Shawshank Maximum Security Prison, for life. Here here he befriends Red, played by Morgan Freeman ( a role he definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar ), your typical Jack of all traits in the prison. Their story was one of trust, hope and friendship which was ultimately the forte of this movie. Robbins acting was methodical, straight-foward and deservingly captures our sympathy. A great supporting cast also gives added strength to an already perfect movie. The background music score haunts me even until today as it successfully depicts the sad, helpless and claustrophobic mood of a maximum security prison. Rich, crisp and vibrant cinematography together with Director Frank Darabont's vivid imagination and direction style brought to life one of the greatest motion picture ever told! 10/10",9
""" The Shawshank Redemption"" is a witching and emotionally charged film that leaves a profound impact on its observers. Set within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the story weaves together themes of stopgap, fellowship, and the power of the mortal spirit.

The film follows the trip of Andy Dufresne, played brilliantly by Tim Robbins, a putatively ordinary banker who's wrongfully condemned of a crime he didn't commit. As Andy adjusts to life behind bars, he forms an doubtful fellowship with Red, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, a fellow capture known for his capability to smuggle contraband into the captivity. Their bond serves as the heart and soul of the film, showcasing the transformative power of connection and fellowship in the most doubtful of places.

What sets"" The Shawshank Redemption"" piecemeal is its capability to touch the deepest recesses of the mortal soul. It delves into the depths of despair, exposing the harsh realities of captivity life, while contemporaneously painting a pictorial portrayal of the adaptability of the mortal spirit. Through Andy's unvarying determination and insuperable spirit, the film teaches us the significance of holding onto stopgap, indeed in the darkest of circumstances.

The performances in this film are nothing short of remarkable. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced depiction of Andy, landing both his vulnerability and unwavering resoluteness. Morgan Freeman, in one of his most iconic places, brings a quiet strength and wisdom to the character of Red. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable, elevating the film to new heights.

Director Frank Darabont consummately brings Stephen King's original story to life, immersing the followership in the gritty and rough world of Shawshank. The pacing of the film is consummately executed, seamlessly blending moments of heart- wrenching drama with subtle humor and genuine humanity.

"" The Shawshank Redemption"" is a rare gem that transcends its captivity setting, touching upon universal themes that reverberate with cult from all walks of life. It's a film that leaves an unforgettable mark on the bystander, reminding us of the power of stopgap, the value of fellowship, and the triumph of the mortal spirit in the face of adversity.

In summary,"" The Shawshank Redemption"" is an extraordinary cinematic experience that deserves all the praise it has garnered over the times. It's a dateless masterpiece that reminds us of the adaptability of the mortal spirit and the transformative power of stopgap. A must- watch for all suckers of cinema.",9
"I have seen this movie twice and even the second time it was still a very special movie although you know what is going to happen...Big compliment for writer Stephen King! (I am wondering if it really happend, although it is too good to be true). Wonderfull acting, great story...with emotional moments but not overdone in any way. My favorite scene is when Andy receives the old books and records (big black CD's from the old days:-) and plays a part from a opera through the prison intercom! If you do have the chance: watch it!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the top 10 American movies ever made. It is written by American's greatest and best selling author Steven King. The acting, directing, etc., in the movie is perfect. Tim Robbins plays the perfect character in the movie and Morgan Freeman gives another stunning performance.",10
"First things first... This is my favorite movie of all time. Therefore, I was disturbed to see a few reviews claiming that this movie isn't all that great. Having only a few college credits remaining until I obtain a degree in Critical Film Analysis, I have studied this film numerous times and can tell you just why it is so great. First off, I read from another review that it was horrible because it was a first-time director. That just happens to be one reason why the film is so great to begin with. The director is passionate about the project since it is his first, and Darabont's passion is displayed magnificently in this film. The same goes for Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves) and Sam Mendes (American Beauty). Both were first time directors and as a matter of fact both won Oscars for their Best Picture winning ""first timers.""

The other unlogical argument against this film that I read was about how ""plain"" it was. Heaven forbid that there is no computer enhanced bullets flying by a body being covered by dozens upon dozens of cameras (The Matrix) or some cheesy George Lucas characters that have no bearing on a story. The Shawshank Redemption is far from a plain movie though. The camera work IS amazing, just look at the scene where Andy is about to be pushed off of the roof that the inmates are tarring. That was pulled off WITHOUT a computer at all. Another argument that I heard: The story is too plain. Well I'm sorry that there is no Hans Solo pressing the *fill in the blank* button that will lift the *fill in the blank* to stop the *fill in the blank* from attacking the planet of *fill in the blank* that is inhabited by the *fill in the blank* race. The Shawshank Redemption is as real as it gets. Why introduce twenty million characters just for the shear joy of it? Darabont shows more emotion with Red and Andy than any other director that I have seen (possibly Sam Mendes may be better by a short bit). Without getting too much further into the film I'll just stop by saying that if you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption there is a reason why it is #2 on the IMDB top 250 list. A good movie is enjoyable to watch, but a great movie will get you lost within the film and open a entire new world that you might never experience. You will lose yourself in the Shawshank Redemption. **I also recommend another Stephen King/Frank Darabont film: The Green Mile.",10
"This is as close to a perfect film as I believe I have ever seen. Everything about it just WORKS. Stephen King famously sells his stories to filmmakers for one dollar, well this has got to be the best dollar he has ever spent. Shawshank arrived with no fanfare, no big premiere, it just opened. When I first read the Stephen King story, I thought it would be one of the best King stories to be made into a film I could imagine, and Frank Darabont did not let me down.

Casting Morgan Freeman was probably the biggest coup for this film, he is the absolute soul of dignity in everything he appears in, Tim Robbins, relatively unknown at the time of filming, is a revelation. It is, in fact, almost impossible to imagine any other actors in a single role in this film it is so perfectly cast. Then there is the music, so wonderfully incidental and appropriate. I could go on and on about specifics, photography, lighting, but it is probably best to say that anyone with a heart and a keen eye for good film-making should not miss this film. Every time I watch it I have a lump in my throat for nearly the entire running time, maybe because I have such a soft spot for it, but also because, when you know the story and it unfolds for you, every time you watch it different emotions come to the fore. There have been criticisms that Shawshank is nothing more than the most manipulative form of emotional heart-string tugging, but those criticisms are wrong, whenever Darabont was at risk of overdoing it with the manipulation, he pulled back. There is a moment near the end when it would have been perfectly appropriate for Freeman's character to burst into tears (the character does in the story), but he does not. It is an immensely effective moment, the expression on his face is so convincing that you cannot help but be reduced to tears yourself. Whether it was the actors decision or the directors is as irrelevant as the many detractors of this beautifully realised masterpiece.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a compelling, moving, and beautiful story which is darkly funny at times. This movie's #2 spot on IMDB is debatable, since it is essentially a formulaic Hollywood story with Hollywood characters... i.e. evil institution (guards) and noble rebels (""some"" prisoners) within a microcosm (prison). Andy Dufresne is so incredibly friggin' smart (for a banker) that is almost super-hero like. Though this is definitely a worthy film, in terms of sheer greatness, Shawshank missed Cool Hand Luke by *this much*... If you want a really top-of-the-line awesome prison movie, Cool Hand Luke is the one to see.",8
"And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight.

While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater.

I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.",9
"Oh Dear..If there would any criteria of rating this movie beyond 10/10 i could have gone further.such a wonderful movie that one could see it in any year , any century. the movie starts with a story of infidelity where husband,an investment banker by profession,Andy (Tim Robbins) having intentions to kill his wife along with her boyfriend(though it wasn't shown in the movie wheather he killed them or not)..and after that the murder suit follow upon him where the Banker sentenced for two life imprisonment.

Andy sent to the notorious shawshank, where he encountered some of the very insane guards and wardons, his fellow red (Morgan freeman) is one of the guy he bonded the most and story goes on like that but by the virtue of his professional skills, Andy got entry into the offices of the jail. but the end is so beautiful and unexpected that one could hardly imagine in his wildest thoughts..u got to see the movie for that. acting wise Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman tops the list..such a calm,superlative and memorable performances.. i love the most is the punchline of the movie ""Hope sets you free""",10
"The Shawshank Redemption in my opinion is the best movie out there. No other movie will show you such a thought provoking, well made, extraordinary acted, brilliant script than this film!

A story of hope and redemption seems cliché and maybe even boring but this tale will never bore you. You'll fall in love with the characters. Morgan Freeman is again at his best, and Tim Robbins gives one of his best performances next to his in Mystic River. You can watch this movie over and over again and you'll still love it and it will feel like your first time seeing it. The movie is filled with passion that it will make you cry (coming from someone who never cries), it's soulful and emotional yet still gives you action. It's a rare gem that you'll fall in love with, I definitely did!",10
"One of my favorite movies of all time. Powerful,thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. Thanks to quietly dignified performances and Darabont's own inventive direction, The Shawshank Redemption remains a first class example of how to approach potentially weighty issues with conviction, style, lightness and wit. Shawshank is one of those rare movies that defines the whole reason I love films. It tells a fantastic story, masterfully written, acted, and directed. You can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and story, and because of that, the film leaves you emotionally drained by the film's end, but still with a sense of hope.",10
"Has to undoubtedly be one of the best movies of all time. Casting, acting, plot, cinematography, musical score. Everyone should see this movie to know what a good movie is. The plot twist at the very end was in itself a work of art. 10/10.",10
"Based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" tells the story of Andy Dusfresne (Tim Robbins), a gentle banker wrongly convicted for the double murders of his wife and her lover. The story goes on to send a powerful message of friendship and hope through even the darkest times imaginable.

""Andy Dusfresne – who crawled through a river of s*t, and came out clean on the other side"", remarks Red, narrator and man-who-knows-how- to-get-things, effortlessly played by the iconic father of narration Morgan Freeman. When we meet Red, he's 20 years into a life sentence with a jaded view of the world and initially thinks little of Dusfresne. However as the months turn into years we watch them form a beautiful friendship and observe two people who truly care for each other, a rarity in many modern movies and arguably life today.

This is testament to the wonderful acting from Robbins and Freeman, and indeed across the board. The supporting cast is excellent, from the corrupt Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his viciously sadistic Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), to the kind, institutionalized librarian Brooks (James Whitmore), every character in Shawshank is well rounded and brilliantly acted. And as if all that wasn't enough, the soundtrack, composed by Thomas Newman, is hauntingly beautiful and perfectly complements the film throughout its 2.5 hours.

The Shawshank Redemption is an emotional roller-coaster in that it truly offers everything, from devastating and disturbing lows to heart-warming highs, and even elements of comedy where appropriate. This movie has such depth and whilst not being preachy in any way, it has many lessons to offer through Andy's character. Andy, for me, embodies the perfect human, caught up in a hurricane of bad luck; he only once complains about his fate, the rest of the time he seems to find goodness in most situations and spends his sentence improving the lives of those around him.

This is epitomized by Red's story who, despite our protagonist being Andy, is our eyes and ears, our story teller and ultimately the one redeemed. Red, the self-proclaimed ""only guilty man in Shawshank"" is all but institutionalized after 30 years in those walls, but it's Andy who gradually shows him the power of hope, of integrity and of not forgetting who you are. He enables him to free himself after being freed from Shawshank.

It comes down to a simple choice really. Get busy living, or get busy dying.",7
"A wonderfully made movie. The best thing about movie is it never looses its pace. Neither it gets fast nor it gets slow... Rightly placed at #2 on IMDb.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman makes a great pair in the movie. Villain, Bob Gluton, the Jailer performs his role very well. ""Hope is good thing, probably one of the best thing, and no good thing ever dies"" is the central theme of the movie according to me.

Calm, Placid banker Andrew Dufresene lives his life with hope without loosing his temper. and that's the movie is all about. Frank Darabont did an amazing job adapting from Stephen King's short story, and he deserves as much praise for it as possible. Nobody, not even my favourite writers such as the Coen brothers of Quentin Tarantino (partly for the fact that the first only writes comedies and the latter only fares in blood spatter) could have achieved this amazing script, which completely uplifts and spellbinds the viewer.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of the 90's era, it's a must see in my book. Movie Goers of every generation will love to see Andy sail off into the sunset.",10
This movie is one of the best and I think it deserves to be ranked first on the site.,10
"This is not just a film. This is not just a work of art that transcends the black and white of human outlook to caste, justice and freedom and paints the human soul in all its true colors. This is not just life set in motion that takes us through it all - jealousy, hopelessness, irony, tragedy, monotony, inspiration, perseverance, success, and the unending miracle that is life itself. This is all of these and more.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is as much about the story it tells as about the way it tells it. We have to really immerse ourselves to understand and share the protagonist's exuberance of redemption that is the principal focal point of the entire film. And the slow and steady unfolding of events in an apparent idyllic manner makes it very easy for us viewers to get engrossed into this wonderfully threaded, emotionally rich story.

All the actors in the film were in perfect tune with one another. Never for once did any of them give an impression that this is a work of fiction and not a true incident captured on camera in real time. Tim Robbins is easily the finest of the cast, portraying the initially deranged, subsequently fearful and tentative, and ultimately the emancipated Andy Dufresne with total compulsion. Morgan Freeman is equally captivating as the wise and ever-supportive ""Red"" Redding, with his wry indifference to the sufferings of life, which finally gives way plain and raw happiness at his own emancipation.

This is a film that makes us appreciate the beauty and subtlety of life, soothes our soul, gives us hope and inspires us to keep trying till we reach our own ""redemption"" - our own freedom from the failures that bind us to the success that we always crave. This is film of life, for life, and a film to live by.",9
"This movie is the most overrated movie of all time. The beginning of the movie is disgusting. Then it passes slowly , slowly , slowly ! .. There are no events !!! only a bunch of people in prison talking to each other.. that's it !! The movie was boring and long.. I mean very boring .. If it was not rated as 9.3 I would just stop watching the movie. But because of the high rating and all the fuss about it I just continued watching it. The ending was absolutely hilarious ! Common !!! a very funny twist that was predictable. But the way they presented that twist to us was hilarious ! Believe me , don't watch this movie, it is literally overrated. If there was zero rating, then this movie deserves it !",10
"This film is number one on the IMDb top 250. This is not the greatest film of all time but this is a film so impossible to hate. It is, as one reviewer wrote, the best film for the worst parts of your life. No film is even comparable to Shawshank when going strictly off of inspirational powers, Rocky is the only other answer that is stupid but its still wrong. I am mocked by my friends for my taste for the dark (taxi driver, once upon a time in America, in the bedroom and the war zone just to name a few favorites) but this film is the only film I have ever seen (again, maybe Rocky) that has ever made me proud to be human. This is truly the role that has defined Morgan Freeman's career (has he really played a different character since?) and the subtleties of Andy Dufresne are endless. He is a stoic character but one of the most likable, most believable and most beloved in film. It is a film built on the little things for much of its two and a half hours, and there are so many beautiful little scenes. We learn to love these characters, when the are dragged through the mud so are we, and when they triumph we are every bit as elated. The world is a nasty and ugly place that will beat you down if you let it, so don't let it. Andy never lost hope. 'Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.' That is what makes the human race so exceptional, for better or worse, we have a hard time giving up. Slaves rarely killed themselves, Holocaust Jews rarely killed themselves, in the darkest of times we somehow find a reason to believe they will end. To give up on faith and hope is to give up on your humanity. Get busy livn' or get busy dying'. That's' goddamn right.",10
"Direction,writing,cinematography everything about this movie is extraordinary....and what can we say about the actors...both tim robbin and morgan freeman delivered the best performances of their career...",10
"There is a good reason why this movie is the highest rated film on IMDb. While watching this, I felt for the characters' pain and suffering, their happiness and cheers. The music and storytelling are amazing. Props to the director for turning this Stephen King story into a masterpiece.",10
"Whis is quite simply one of the finest motion pictures ever made. The most surprising thing is that it comes from one of the most unlikely of sources, Stephen King. I have never been a fan of his horror work and doubt I ever will be but his serious side has proved to be quite excellent. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were robbed by the Academy when this movie came out. They both deserved to win awards for these performances. Morgan Freeman that comes as no shock as he can elevate most anything from trash to gold so when you give him a good role it becomes practically transcendent.

Tim Robins was more of a surprise to me. I have seen him in a few movies but he never really left much of an impression on me. In this film though he provided one of the 90's best performances. The rest of the cast also filled out quite well. James Whitemore was heartbreaking in his role as the elderly librarian. This movie deserves its spot on at #2 on the IMDb top list and I would actually argue that it should bump The Godfather out as I think that movie is highly over-rated but then that's just me.

If you haven't seen this movie than I suggest that you go out and rent it now. Better yet just buy it as I doubt you will be disappointed. Cheers!",10
"Great great movie! I wasnt expecting to be so good despite the reviews. It is so obvious prison break copied many ideas from this movie. But Forrest Gump for me is probably the best movie, no wonder it won oscar for best picture in 1994. Im quite sure this movie could had won one oscar for best picture if it was released in another year.",10
"This beautiful movie speaks about hope, about doing your best even when luck turns against you, about humanity, with his lights and shadows, it's about friendship, about cowardice, about the miseries and corruption of the evil... In essence, it's a movie about virtue and vices, staged on a prison. It's this kind of movies that despite being long, they keep interest and seem short. A piece of art.",10
"The chief, Frank Darabont, paints the jail in dreary grays and shadows so that when key occasions do happen, they appear to have a unique kind of energy.

Andy, as played by Robbins, remains quiet about his viewpoints. Red, as Freeman plays him, is hence a significant component in the story: His nearby perception of this man, as the years progressed, gives the manner in which we screen changes and track the proportion of his impact on everyone around him. And all the time there is something different occurring, covered up and secret, which is uncovered exclusively toward the end.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is definitely not a discouraging story, in spite of the fact that I might have made it sound that way. There is a great deal of life and humor in it, and warmth in the kinship that develops between Andy and Red. There is even fervor and tension, albeit not when we anticipate it. Yet, for the most part, the film is a moral story about clutching a feeling of individual worth, notwithstanding everything. In the event that the film is maybe a little delayed in its center entries, perhaps that is important for the thought, as well, to provide us with a feeling of the heavy entry of time, before the greatness of the last recovery.",10
"Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.",10
A timeless script and acting. The masterpiece that thrives the cinema into a new era.,9
"Exciting story, cool story, my family loves it all. We watched it several times. Really this is a highlight, the excitement in the movie passes us. Differential that marked the film, and brought a unique characteristic. Its direction, its actors, its actresses, really marks generations, and will pass through generation to generation.",10
"I was a teenager when I rented that movie after a friend insisted in me watching that ""you're gonna love it, I guarantee that"" he said to me.

I have always seen Stephen King's job contemptuosly, I think his books are cheap, so I took it home just because he insisted.

Oh my God... it is a masterpiece. I won't say anything new, everybody has already said everything about how amazing this movie is. I own it on VHS in Spanish and English and I have it on DVD now. I think I bought pretty much a dozen of copies to give to my friends.

This movie absolutely changed a part of me in a very good way.

BTW, it just so happens that Stephen King's books result in very good movies... go figure!",8
"So this was quite a film, quite an experience I'll say; this movie told me to do my absolute best and I guess that's all there is to it. (I don't really know why other people like it but I like it)",10
"If you want to make a great film, follow the example of Frank Darabont. Every element is beautiful here. No More Any Words! Make sure of this yourself, and you will see all the amazing work done by the entire crew!

9.4 out of 10",10
One of the best jail/prison movies ever created. This movie changed my life.,8
"Got me right in the feels. Was speechless after watching, so breathtaking in every way",10
Its a must watch move in a life time... my friend recommend me this movie and when i saw... i m speechless. Must watch..! every one have to see this once in your life time,10
Absolutely incredible. It truly is sad that this movie did not win best picture because it is one of the finest ever made. Morgan Freeman at his best and Tim Robbins is perfect. This movie sucks you in and never lets you go. A movie you can watch over and over.,10
Ur Mind Goona Sucks You Can't Believe What happened to You,10
I first saw it in 2016 and since then this movie has become an important part of my life. It teaches multiple theories of how to be a strong figure doesn't matter how worst our life has become. I highly recommend you this movie.this movie will always stay closer to my heart..,10
Too overrated. The only thing going on is: he tried to escape prison. And then what?,10
"The first time I saw Shawshank, I loved it and didn't want it to end. I remember that desire being surprisingly powerful, despite understanding that I had enjoyed it as much as I did while watching it. Its power surprised me because I didn't understand fully how or why I felt the way I did. On subsequent viewings, I prepared myself for the ending, for THAT feeling, which I began to examine.

I would describe it as something on par with the end of a relationship, if not perfectly in scale, then certainly in context. A good relationship. One that ends too early, but does so because it must, because that is just how it is sometimes. I am always struck with a deep yearning to see more, to know and feel more, but also a comfort. That even though I didn't get everything I wanted, what I got is a damn sight good enough, and I should be grateful for that. But it aches, too. And then you realize that it's over, and you're going to wake up tomorrow, and start living your life again. But now you'll live having gone through this, with this perspective, this story in your memory.

It's small, not actually the same experience, but it's close. The same shape and color. No other film, no story, gives me this feeling. And just like in relationships, sometimes I end up watching nothing but disappointing titles, I have a moment when I ask myself why I do it. That maybe I'm wasting my time. And then I remember. And then I hope.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the greatest film that had ever been made I have viewed it multiple times over the years and it never gets old. It is the story of a man imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, and then he must try with all he can to escape from there. It is a story we've seen or heard a thousand times. It is nothing new. And that is the beauty of it. We think we're here to see the same old story yet again, however, it will shock and surprise you as it unfolds. It is a story of brotherhood behind bars, of an unlikely friendship that last a lifetime, and, of redemption.",9
"The best movie I've ever seen. I've seen her more than twenty times and it's always perfect. On the 10th year anniversary DVD edition Frank Darabont claims that the movie has helped people through divorces and losing love ones and so on, just see the movie and you'll understand why.

The scene were Andy Dufresne finally gets out of Shawshank and he's standing in the rain and raising his hands is one of the better scenes in the movie history. I've got that poster up on my wall. It's amazing how you feel brightened when you see that particular scene.

Try seeing the movie a couple of times, and then reading the book which is written by Steven King, and then seeing the movie again. It pushes the movie up to another level and you'll like it more thereafter.",10
"Such a gripping story -- innocent people do get locked up, 'ya know -- and it's so very sad... I loved the end of the movie. Very realistic, I'm afraid -- I pray it makes criminals think twice before thinking that prison is tolerable - and I wish our criminal justice system would wake up and make some corrections. People need rehabilitation, not torture.",10
"This was a good prison movie, although I have never really seen that many, besides Cool Hand Luke. I guess I like this movie better than Cool Hand Luke, because this is made around the time I was in high school.

Anyways, I rented this movie last weekend when I went home. I saw it earlier on TNT, but like always it was edited. I like the story about a man sentenced to 2 life sentences and the friends he makes in prison, especially Morgan Freeman who is a wonderful actor! It starts in the year 1947, until Robbins busts out of prison. Coincidentally, Freeman gets out just after Robbins breaks out. Not that this really matters, but wouldn't all of these guys look much older after twenty years? I mean I look older than I did when I was in early high school, and that was only 5 years ago! These guys didn't show any external signs of aging from the beginning of the movie until the end, which was a period of 20 years. Also, wouldn't the guard, you know the real S.O.B. Hadley have been forced to retire? He looked to be in his 30's when Robbins arrived at Shawshank in 1947, but you think that when the show arrived into the 1950's he would have been forced to retire. But, I enjoyed all of the characters.

I don't know if I would say this was the best #1 movie of all time. You have to consider Jaws, Psycho, Star Wars, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, etc. But this movie could be considered a classic, but it's hard to say which movie is more of a classic than another one was. I would definitely rate this movie as a classic.

But, if you want a good prison movie to watch, I would recommend this if it isn't checked out. If this classic prison movie is checked out, then I would get Cool Hand Luke.",8
"I'm afraid that I must join the chorus of those that question the placement of this movie at the top of the rankings. Although I enjoy the movie a great deal, it is mainly because of the superb job done by the actors, especially the leads. Without that, I don't think the movie would have amounted to much, because the plot is relatively thin; wide swaths could have been cut from the film and no one would have noticed. Take the library Andy built. It did not advance the basic plot at all, as with other scenes. You could argue that it was precisely these small events that made the film good, and I would agree. But that's my point:there wasn't really anything tying the movie together other than our sympathy for the characters. While well developed characters are a central part of any good movie, there should still be something driving the action other than our sympathy for them; i.e. some sort of chain of events that drives the action independently of the characters. To everyone who thinks this is the best movie ever, I invite you to watch a couple films from the top 5 of the AFI list. You can argue about the AFI's placement all day, but all of the top 5 are better rounded films than Shawshank. If you still feel Shawshank is better than the rest, more power to you.",10
"...movie and like another of my favorites, ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" one that I could see over and over again and still find something new to appreciate. This is a jewel of a movie and one that I'm sorry didn't receive the recognition it so richly deserved. James Whitmore should at least have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor; that he didn't is a disgrace. Morgan Freeman gives his usual awesome performance. Rent this movie! Then a few months later, rent it again. This movie is so poignant and says so much about friendship and hope that I defy anyone not to be moved by it.",10
Truly deserves the top rated movie. Definitely Must watch,10
"I'm kind of lost for words for this movie. I saw it last night on my DVD-player and what I saw was brilliance. The story is about a banker Andy (Tim Robbins) who get prisoned for murdering his wife and her secret lover. In prison he says he's innocent, which makes the other inmates break out in laughter. No one is innocent in prison they say. `They've all been f***ed by lawyers.' What follows is a fight for justice. A inmate (George Freeman) who calls himself Red (the other inmates call him that because he's `irish') finds something special in Andy. They connect soon and becomes good friends. What strikes me about the main characters is that hope and belief is something that they always have. Even though they go through some very tough times in prison, they always have that good confidence in themselves. Go see this movie, if you love the concept of feeling free. There's no let downs or grief ending this movie. You have to see it for yourself.",8
"Tim forehead robbins does a classic job as a hot shot banker who was wrongfully accused. in this crusade robbins and ""Red"" morg freeman become good buds and with william sadlers upraving comedic factor the movie simply goes down as one of the greatest philms of all time. frank darabonts finest film and bub gunton plays a great role as the warden.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that many people can relate to, especially if you had to overcome an unexpected experience that left you institutionalized and scarred. People are not institutionalized only in prisons and hospitals, but in schools, colleges, broken families, society, and other organizations. Trying to liberate ourselves from our conservative past or beliefs is not an easy process.

The Shawshank Redemption is one movie that can help start that process. It's a movie that can be watched repeatedly and after each time, even the most savvy critic may be enlightened by the depth and development of the characters, the smooth yet scintillating story line, the reoccuring symbolic themes, the uninhibited realism, the scenes and music ranging from the cold gothic prison architecture to the oak tree from a Robert Frost poem, and many uninvited personal insights we hold dearly and secretly to ourselves. Watching the movie over and over again is similar to a religious baptism where your past sins and crimes are washed away by the never-ending hope that you'll be free to achieve your highest dreams. I'm not going to reiterate the plot, dialogue, and other highlights of the film. The movie speaks for itself.

The plethora of movies in this time makes it difficult to dig and find the very few movies that exuberate the same effect as the Shawshank Redemption. The purpose of these reviews (also under Leonardo (24601-6) and Leonardo) is to express my tastes and to invite anyone with similar opinions to recommend movies on the same caliber.

It is my all-time personal favorite movie--the only one I would give a 10/10.",10
"This is by far and away the best movie I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it, do so. (If you don't know the movies outcome, definately see it!).

Everything about this movie is outstanding. What most people notice first about great movies is the fine acting. Not only is this film's acting superb, but the script, the costumes, the scenery, the directing...everything...just outstanding. Rent it for the first time...rent it again...I recently sat through TNT's double presentation, and it still had me totally absorbed, even the second time around.",10
"As stated in the tagline, this is a film of hope. The difficult question is however, is whom does it refer to? The two lead characters (Andy Dufresne and 'Red' Redding, played superbly by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman respectively) are both inmates at Shawshank penitentiary, one innocent and the other guilty. This however, does not mar your opinion of either character - you are able to sympathise with both of them, as you are with many of the prisoners. You root for these criminals every inch of the way, despite their wayward past and current situations. This is perhaps the ultimate feelgood movie, with the greatest twist since Kevin Spacey walked away in The Usual Suspects. Unlike other films of this genre however, there is no need for constant assurance that this will make you feel good - bar one or two moments in the middle, there is no hint that anything positive will happen to either hero, right up until that moment.

The greatest factor in this movie must be the characterisation. Prison guards turn from monsters, to friends to cowards; prisoners range from the horrific, to cruel, to pitiful and finally to likable. Above all, unlike too many recent films, each and every character is human and believable.

Is there an answer to that question? Which character has the lead - the narrating Red or the centrepiece Andy? Who has the hope? The answer to that lies in the interpretation of a film that can mean anything.",10
"In one word: Magnificent! This movie is a masterpiece! It soaks you up and it leaves you behind feeling hopeful for ways which at first didn't seem to be there.. a really fantastic movie you definitely should see! Morgan Freeman, once again, showing how much of a big actor he is! *thumbsup to the cast & crew*",7
"There are some very special movies out there. There are those which are highly thought-provoking and leave you questioning things. There are those which are a mindless blast and great fun to boot. And then there are those which are simply sublime. They might keep it simple, but they execute in such a way that they drag you in deep and have you caring about the characters. The Shawshank Redemption is one such film. This is a absolutely outstanding story which is as simple as it is eloquent.

It's about a man wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and sentenced to life at Shawshank. There he slowly finds friends and the drama of their lives is the focus of the story. He promises many times that he *will* break out within 20 years, and no one, of course, believes him. It's this hope which drives the whole movie. Men in prison have nothing but hope. Take that away and they have nothing. And that's what Andy (The main character) wants to avoid.

The ending to this is simply breathtaking in its simplicity, but incredibly heartwarming and will have you punching the air in delight.

Nominated for 4 oscars, this won none of them. Utter travesty.

A magnificent story.",9
"Some movies really need more than 2 hours to develop their story. I think ""The Shawshank Redemption"" would have been more successful if it was not so long. The story is truly excellent...moving, intense, and joyous at the same time. I think it could have been improved by editing out a few scenes which were redundant to the purpose of the mood they were establishing.",10
"Every so often, I feel cinematic achievement reaches a new zenith...a point where I feel (albeit erroneously) that the bar of accomplishment can rise no more. Yet, as said, I am eventually mistaken, mainly due to remarkable stories of profound creative intensity. These are the creations that highlight vital essences of life and society.

The Shawshank Redemption is truly an element of such a category.

The Stephen King novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is a relatively brief tale, a section of a larger book called 4 Seasons. Still, it is brilliantly adapted as a feature-length motion picture, with no flaws or injustices therein.

If you are wondering why it is such a good movie, then you only need to think about one word: freedom. Think about what it means, and how easy may be to take for granted in today's liberated world. Set in the hardened American past, The Shawshank Redemption teaches us a valuable lesson about the fickle nature of sovereignty, and the inevitable boundaries that restrict us along the path of life. Still, despite the misery of indeterminate and forceful detainment, a love of life is found.

As such, this film presents a quest like no other. The characters seek to transcend their enslavement in a vile microcosm of dubious honesty and ill will, cherishing the subtle scents of freedom that waft through the senses on a very limited basis. After seeing this film, you'll never look at a bottle of beer or an opera record the same way: when you have nothing else, such frivolities are your only ties to freedom. Still, the intelligent social analysis does not end at this basic level. Rather, it continues by showing the affects of being reintroduced to reality, and the ensuing overdose of true liberty...

Nevertheless, as clear-cut as the overall theme may seem, a mark of cunning snakes through it...fervent...unexpected...

The result will knock you out of your seat. See for yourself. 10/10",10
"I suppose I can't call it the single best film ever, but I really like it. I must admit I don't understand the people who call it too sappy. I'm usually pretty observant about sap, but I find this film truly touching. Well-written, well-filmed, well-acted, it is very moving from beginning to end. Some necessary changes were made from the original novella, such as making it one warden instead of several, changing over time.

The warden, in my opinion, is one of the rare well-made bad guys. You don't like him at all, but he still has human motivations, not super-evil, over-the-top unbelievable qualities. Of course, Red and Andy are both well-crafted characters.

It's a fine, understated film. I think it's one of the best films of the past several years. Good music, too.

One more thing: I saw somewhere the complaint that no one seems to age, though the movie spans several years. While the aging process isn't given the full focus of the film, it's clearly there. I don't think that's a valid complaint. My two cents are now used up.",10
"I've read a lot of the comments here. I've never voted for this movie once, but now I'm going to give it what it deserves. And I am going to try to describe why a lot of Shawshank fans are voting this the best movie ever.

The reasons that this movie is great are: it has incredible acting, incredible story-telling, incredible pace, incredible writing and dialogue, incredible imagery, and an incredible twist and ending.

The Godfather also has these qualities.

But the reason Shawshank is better is because it literally is potentially life-changing. People watch Shawshank and someone truly may believe in HOPE. They may truly believe their lives will get better. They may truly believe others' lives can be made better. Its message is not only told, but it is FELT and oft times ABSORBED. For men, for women, for old, for young, for everyone. It is a masterpiece. What other movie affects people in this way? You don't get that with The Godfather. GF is a great film, but you just come out of it saying, ""Wow, that was one of the best films I've ever seen."" With Shawshank, you say more than that. You feel more than that.

You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this movie, by a novice director, will frustrate experienced and future directors forever.",10
"I actually watched last year's 'The Green Mile' before I got round to seeing this. And in many respects I'm glad. This film is better constructed, has a far more powerful script, and, most tellingly, a far more belivable story (the Green Mile dabbles in the supernatural and improbable). What makes this movie so good is that it really deals with the psyche and emotions of humanity, and isn't scared to go into detail with these emotions, even if it means that the plot is sidetracked for a few minutes. The male bonding throughout the film is touching, and (although sentimental) completely believable. The twist, although not quite as surprising as the 'Usual Suspects', adds a little bit extra to a plot that before was pretty much at the mercy of Morgan Freeman's narrative, which, while well delivered, all gets a bit similar after a while. I think the biggest achievement here is, apart from the bread and butter stuff like 'solid acting', 'sensitive direction', and 'breathtaking photography', is just how well the movie shows its time scale. The story is based over 20 years, charting the 'prison career' of an innocent man, and apart from the greying of Freeman's hair, it also features a lot of nostalgic conversations. Two tragedies among the group of friends that we watch also give a sense of perspective. At the centre though, are Freeman's brief meetings with the prison board, asking for a release every ten years. As he delivers the most moving part of the film- his third speech to this board, I guarantee you will be weeping buckets. The first movie I ever watched that meant so well as to be 'beyond criticism' was 'Schindler's List'. This is the second.",10
"This is without a doubt one of my 5 favorite movies. Even now, a month after I first saw it I still think about it and repeat its maxim ""Hope is a good thing."" What can I say but that this is the beautiful made movie I have ever seen. This movie is the most uplifting movie I have ever seen and also one of the smartest in its ending. I had before seen the posters for the movie and thought that this was going to be another dumb movie but then TNT did me a favor and aired it on its ""New Classics"" program. Plus, IMBD and several articles exposed me to the newly found popularity of the movie and I was hooked. As I watched the movie, I knew that this would be one my new personal classics. Its moral, that hope is a good thing and its saying ""get busy living or get busy dying, stil intrigue me. The movie is amazing in its beauty. No one could have played Andy better than Robbins and Morgan Freeman was superb in his portrayel of a great character. What can I say but that by the end of the movie you feel good inside. You feel hope, just what the character feels. The movie makes you feel what the character feels and that is one of its best qualities.

See the movie and be changed. It is definitely one of the best.",10
"One of the best movies that i have ever seen.It truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportions.People just don't make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is About Andy Dufrane,a banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prison.the movie shows the various hardships faced by Andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free. the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghast.it is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box office.BUT NOW ALMOST EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THIS MOVIE FOR WHAT IT TRULY IS - A MASTERPIECE OF STORYTELLING.",10
The movie has a beautiful evolution starting from how it all began to how it all ended. It shows the struggle of prisoners and how people can grow and change if there is a will. I would recommend this excellent movie to everyone.,10
"It's fun to watch this movie a second time and pick up some things you never noticed the first time. So many things simply went unnoticed (Andy writing into the wall, his little geology tool, the ""sex symbols throughout the decades"" posters) and suddenly wind together to grab our attention and make this a wonderful movie. The film was fascinating in the fact that it showed us how ""lifers"" could only witness the change of culture in the outside world by observing the prisoners that come and go over the years, and this being the only glimpse on how the world is changing, they become institutionalized, and actually fear their freedom. I actually found myself feeling sorry for murderers, and I debated with myself on whether or not they should be released if they truly become rehabilitated. The determination and hope transpired by Andy brought our hopes up: Most movies bring our hopes up only to bring them down, but when we see him running through the pond and standing in the rain with his arms raised and the great music accompanying the scene, our hopes our fulfilled. This is one of only about three or four films that had great smarts and left me completely satisfied. 10/10.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the type of film which has divided its audience into two categories: those who loved it, and those who don't care for it. There is rarely anything between. Flawless acting, passionate direction, and a memorable score have made the film a powerful cinematic experience, and at times, it can be thought provoking. It never lacks in pace, there is always a steady rhythm to the film. The Shawshank Redemption is a modern masterpiece.

Rating: 10",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest film ever made. It is one of those few films where I wouldn't touch a frame, given the chance. It is absolutely flawless, as well as the most inspiring film ever made.

Steven King's novel is great, but what really gave life to this film is Frank Darabont's incredible direction. It becomes more hypnotic every time I see it. There is a point to every shot and angle, as well as everything that is said and done in the story. Everything is necessary to entertain or to inspire.

Citizen Kane may also be perfection, but it can't inspire the viewer and help them to connect with the characters. Citizen Kane is a great film, a top ten film, but it's nowhere close to this.

I recommend several viewings to anyone who has never seen The Shawshank Redemption. You will walk away a better person every time.",10
"I won't go into all the good things about the movie, since pretty much all of the other posts do, I'll just say I agree. There was only one thing wrong with it. Are we supposed to believe that in a prison in 1948, a black guy was best buds with a bunch of white guys? Oh well, this was made when it wasn't politically correct to have a movie with an all white cast. If you can get past that one flaw, this movie is a 10. If you can't, the movie is still an 8 or 9.

If you're depressed, this is an excellent movie to watch. It focuses on when life has really beaten you down. No matter what happens to him, he tries to get the best of the situation.",10
"Years ago I was browsing IMDb and looked at this film called Shawshank Redemption as the highest ranked film. I had to watch it. Everyone I asked around praised the film so I decided to finally sit down and watch. Every single aspect of this film shines, but here are some highlights.

Andy's character arc is amazing. He is truly a troubled man, hanging on a single shred of hope to get by a horrible life in prison. Red is a man destined to be in prison, befriending Andy and haunting us in Morgan Freemans impeccable narration. Shawshank Prison is a haunting place, the film just absorbs us into it. We feel it, it feels terrible, eternal even. All this is joined by Thomas Newman's fantastic score (my favorite of his) and one of the most memorable main themes ever made.

I had to re-watch this film to fully appreciate every detail. This film wastes no scene, no character. Everything works. And best of all, it's one of the most fulfilling and hopeful films you can watch. It has truly become my favorite film. It came to me in a time when I had lost a lot of hope, so you can consider this to be a personal film as well. Haven't seen it, yet? What are you waiting for??",9
"I'll watch this any time I see that it's on TV. Doesn't matter if it's 5 minutes in or halfway through. As soon as I've watched one scene I'm sucked in and will watch it right to the end.

There's something mesmerising about it. The visuals, the soundtrack and voiceover combined with a great story and characters make it.

I still remember the first time I saw it on an old VHS of my parents and was blown away.

A must see film for everyone.",10
An Inspiring story that teaches us all the lessons of life on all levels of everyday living. You think about JC everytime you watch this and the different lessons from the bible which this film instills in all of us. To reach such a level as all of these character is truly what all of mankind tries to attain. An amazing film!!,1

"Decided to check out IMDb topper as a time pass and was i glad i did.One watch and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been added to my all time top movies...The golden year of '94 which gave the world some of the best films of all time didn't disappoint with this one...The cast was superb...Tim Robbins is amazing and Morgan freeman again shows why he is at the top.The bond between the main characters is well developed and the climax is mind blowing.The movie gives genuine inspiration and is more than suitable for repeated viewing when one feels down.I give it full 10/10 as it gives u more than a regular film does.It shows the importance of hope in life and why one should never loose it.The Tagline tells it all - ""FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER,HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE""...",10
"When I saw Shawshank's redemption, I realized all of this. There is absolutely no fun in life in prison. It is even more hopeless, and it is more difficult to find hope in despair. People always say not to fight against fate, but when Andy defeats fate, we can also say that this victory is just part of fate.",10
I have see its movie many times. so addicted A wonderful movie!,10
This is the best film I have ever seen. Always it will be in my heart.,10
This the movie with full climax and i loved the movie after my O level it means you need an anticipation power to judge the movie. The wonderful movie of the era,10
"There are very few movies which have the power to change a person's life. A two and a half hour movie which has the power to turn your long darkest hours into the most delightful moments if you are really willing to feel every bit of the movie. This movie gave me a hope and reminded me of a quote that ""tough times never last but tough people do"".There are a lot more things to learn from this movie. Don't miss them because you may never come across them in your life so beautifully. This movie goes into my favorite movies list which only had 2 movies so far(in 22 years) excluding this one. This is my first review which I strongly felt to be posted.""DON'T MISS IT...................

Watched this movie twice yesterday. OMG!!!!! Avoided watching it all these years because I knew there would be a lot of unimaginable brutality. Finally gave in yesterday. The depth of each character portrayed so fully how their role affected the rest. The magnificence of Andy's not just surviving 19 years in that mess, knowing his innocence. He thrived and did so much good that the corrupt ""Christian"" warden was so desperate to keep him there that he committed murder. I loved the way that everything was tied together and released by the end.",10
This is one of those movies I just have to watch when it's on. The story and script is awesome. This is how all movies should be made.,10
"I see like 1400 people rated this movie a 1 out of 10. Please, if you are one of these people, email me so we can talk, and so i can ultimately rip your soul apart and see what it is like to be non-human. As far as the movie goes, im sure not many people have seen it, if you havent, please do so, you wont be sorry.",10
The storyline was simply marvelous. The creation and sequencing of the scenes were also great. The acting of Morgan Freeman was really awesome and close to reality. Besides it changed the view of the world about how to see life without breaking down in any cruel situation.,8
"Please all, watch this fantastic piece of moving picture.",10
"Is it Michael Jordan of cinematography? We'll probably not but everyone has an opinion for the greatest. This movie is Deep on a soul level. This movie can be watched and rewatched, it ties together so many strings of plot line. It's a mosaic masterpiece in my opinion but hey I'm a young adult male from the boondocks of Mississippi, what do I know?. It's one of my favorites and merits the #1 spot on IMDB. I personally have it in my top 5 All time. Braveheart being my Goat. Maybe I'm biased since Mississippi is graced with Morgan Freeman but this movie in no way deserves the 1 stars from the few trolls. Then agin if you are one of the 100 haters of the 2,000,000 good reviews then I say scoreboard speaks for itself. Also I'll agree I don't agree with half of the ""top IMDb movies"".",10
"One of the greats. Loved every second of it, so many emotions packed into one film. Can definitely see the reason as to why it's the highest rated film on this app!",10
"Ever since I was a kid, I have enjoyed this movie. I hope it never goes away!",10
This movie is very good. When i heard about the story from one of my friend i thought that it will be not nice movie to watch for me . But i watched . I have no complaints about this movie. I hope you will also not have any complaints if you watch..,10
"This movie is one of the best dramas that I have ever seen. The movie follows the life of a hot shot banker who is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. He proclaims throughout the movie that he is innocent however. As the movie progresses we see things inside this prison that we hope never really happens. There are incidents of brutality, graft, and even murder. The guards of the prison use the main character, Andy Dufresne, talent as a banker to do their tax returns and the warden uses him to make a fortune. Andy said it best when he said, ""The funny thing is - on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook."" Everything was different inside the prison. This movie shows that no matter what the conditions are they can never completely break someone's spirit which is shown by this movie's happy ending.",8
"Wow, this film touches a very deep and unmarked part of my soul that I never knew existed.

I feel my soul just flipping inside out and puckering throughout the struggles of the multitude of characters.

If art is supposed to reach out and touch you, then this by far is the pinnacle of the motion pictures.",10
"Best movie ever.

Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red , experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.",10
"I enjoy this movie and have seen it multiple times. My only issue with the movie is that the character, Red (Morgan Freeman) is not accurate for the time period of the movie. I seriously doubt that Red because of his race would be such a leader of all inmates in the 1940's. And, the ""go to"" inmate for buying items? I doubt it. Some strong willed white inmate would have corned that market. He might have been a leader of the African Americans in the prison, but not the whites. Now before that starts some race debate about the topic, I only am pointing out how the times were in the 1940's, 50's, etc.

My issue with that topic is that I think we should accurately portray society as it was no matter how ugly it was, not as we wish it had been.",10
"This is... brilliant. I'm no film expert, and I don't pretend to be, but... this movie is just brilliant. It humanizes prisoners. It tells an interesting story while having plenty of artistic value. And I can appreciate that.",10
"The only movie that should be allowed an 11/10 rating. Exceptional casting, script, historic accuracy, insight into the justice and prison system, focusing on the rehabilitation side as well. Absolutely outstanding.",10
"Shawshank is simply perfection. Hardly a flaw in its technical execution, and virtually every onscreen performance is brilliant. One of the greatest films ever made & what moviemaking is all about.",10
"Let me just say that I liked the movie. I love Freeman, I respect Robbins. Reading King. But the review is red. I explain:

In the IMDB list (as well as on Kinopoisk), films often float, sometimes climbing to second place in the list, and then dropping to one hundred and ninety-third, etc. The picture changes. But one thing remains the same: The Shawshank Redemption comes first.

The site has almost the entire filmography of mankind, but this story remains the best. Yes, the story is good, as is the setting of the film. But is this the best thing that the world has created in more than a century of work? Is this what worries people? The most pressing? Deeper than Forrest Gump? More classic than the ""Titanic,"" a tacitly declared must see?

TV ignores ""Escape"". The last time I saw it was last or the year before last on TNT. So the masses don't like him that much?

I do not understand. It is not clear how this film stood out from the crowd. It does not want to be reviewed, there is no brilliant soundtrack, video sequence, exciting plot. Just a good movie. One time viewing.

If someone can explain to me why he is the best, write in a message. I will be grateful.",8
"what a narration..???,One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair.",9
"film which would touch your heart would inspire you and lead your vision to the world where every problem can be solved and you will get what you deserve if u had little faith and patience . this will make u realize that how patience can be sometime more effective than nuclear bomb

story revolves around a guy(Tim Robbins) who is in prison for committing murder of his wife trying to survive prison and as time pass by he is actually running all the funds of the prison ,morgan freeman is one of his mates in the movie and has done full justice to his character with some turns and twist in end story is ended beautifully and with utmost perfection .

in brief i would say

If u want to see the movie with perfect storyline with perfect execution,with perfect characters for each role, with the perfect dialogs this is the perfect movie u should watch if u haven't seen yet this is the PERFECT time",10
"oh,this is really a very good one i've ever seen.Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.remember?from the movie,u can get that.if u never see it,go ahead now,or u will regret,i am sure.but to my disappoint,it doesn't get any awards. and when the old man left the prison,he found he was not able to touch the world,really hard for him to do that,and in the end he rather die.it truely shows many prisoner's feelings.i was deeply moved. and this is the one shows the humanity,u should watch it!",10
"This is a film that is heavy on character and dialogue and delivers on both. The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are outstanding, as are each of the supporting actors. This film was adapted from a short story, 'Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption,' written by Stephen King. Perhaps it is because it's adapted from a short story as to why this works so well as there are only minor changes and nothing essential is left out, leaving the film makers with the ability to strengthen and stretch out the main focus, which is the bond created by the two main characters. In my personal opinion I would say this film is one of the most successful book to script adaptations in film history. The direction is brilliant in the way it is almost not noticeable as it relies on the actors and their interactions with each other to keep the audience interested. Cinematography is worth a mention also as each shot is captured beautifully. In summary, Shawshank is a must see and a well deserved film classic.",10
See it over and over again! Another one I watch every time it's on.,10
"Frank Darabont did an execellent adaption, beutiful story showing the real live.",10
"I was one of the many movie-goers who saw The Shawshank Redemption without being aware it was a Stephen King story, and so had the pleasure of seeing the movie without prior expectations.

The Shawshank Redemption is, without doubt, the finest conversion from book to film of a Stephen King story. Perhaps because 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' (which can be found in the Different Seasons book) is short, and thus has less for the film makers to put on the screen.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver faultless performances as a hardened criminal (Freeman) and a man pleading innocence (Robbins), and the supporting cast of criminals and guards does a brilliant job of creating a world full of repentent criminals, cruel wardens, and (without spoiling anything) 'less than friendly' cons.

What makes The Shawshank Redemption such a memorable movie is that it manages to create characters that the viewer loves, in a scenario and location where you'd never expect to find them. These characters, despite their faults, have you hoping for the best but fearing for the worst for the entirety of the movie. Fans of King will no doubt be familiar with the way he can create such characters, but the feat is rarely carried over onto the screen.

I like a movie that can stimulate emotion in me, and The Shawshank Redemption did that. There are things to laugh at, scenes to flinch away from (although nothing like American History X), and most importantly for the film, things that make you want to cry in a mixture of disbelief and shock.

A brilliant movie, and worthy of the Oscar nomination it got and probably should have won.

See if you liked: American History X, The Green Mile, Life is Beautiful. Strengths: Brilliant cast, excellent story-telling, King's usual attention to realism. Weaknesses: None. My Rating: 9.5 out of 10",10
"It is very hard to think of something bad about this film.The direction is incredible, bringing about highly memorable performances, and a beautifully shot film.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are sensational, carrying this film on their shoulders as if it were the easiest job in the world - a tribute to them as this film must have been an incredibly demanding shoot - it is a long and emotional film.

The development of their friendship is wonderful to watch, as is Andy's gradual assimilation into the prison society - however sad it may well be.

Frank Darabont it seems was the ideal man to take the helm of this movie. Many films in this sort of genre can feel like they are missing something, as if there were sections left on the editing room floor - not this film, everything fits perfectly in to place. This leads to a very long film, (which could perhaps be its only criticism - be warned it is long - though the longer the better for me) but one which sucks you right into the prison world, and keeps you right there until the utterly stunning last shot of the film!

Viewers should be warned that some scenes are of a disturbing nature, dealing with issues that may offend some people. However, this should not put you off seeing this film. It deals with the realities of prison, and in no way glorifies the goings on.

What we must realise however, is that this film is not necessarily about the brutality of prison and the way prison society operates, it is about human connection and interaction, and the indomitable nature of the human spirit. By the last scene we should feel uplifted at what has been achieved - not only by the characters in the story however, but by the film makers!

This film is deservedly number 3 on the top 250 list! Congratulations to all involved in making it! A must see for anyone! Sensational 10/10",10
"I've been meaning to see this movie for several years now, having heard all the hype and comments rating this as one of the best films of all time. It certainly wasn't disappointing- despite the relatively slow pace compared to most brainless blockbusters of today and tendency towards sentimentality that crept up from time to time. It certainly wasn't one of the greatest of all films, in my opinion, either; simply an intriguing story, with something to teach us, perhaps, very well told and very well acted. It's probably a movie I'd watch again, though not straight away, as it is quite slow paced, and, just towards the end, I felt it was getting a little too drawn out. But it's very good to look at, there are some great performances, a nice musical score from Thomas Newman, and a great plot, with a wonderful twist at the end. So, overall this is a very good movie and one I would recommend.

8/10",8
"A true transcendence of common ground between prisoner and inmate can be found within this movie. What makes a good person, does it really depend on which side of the bars you live that makes you a good person or bad person. This movie answers that inevitable question.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest movies of all time. The originality of the plot, well developed characters and engrossing story keeps you glued to your seat. Watching it for the first time, the initial slow pace of the movie may baffle you but it quickly transforms into a thrilling story that makes you wonder about how life can suddenly change. It was a new experience to learn about the North American prison system and the life within the walls of a correctional facility. While watching it for a second time I was engrossed by the subtle hints at every stage of the movie that built up to a spectacular ending. This is a story of injustice, friendship, bonding, struggle, patience, sorrow, happiness and ingenuity – a true emotional roller coaster that covers you with a generous splattering of brutal truth. It teaches us to never give up on life and the importance of a meticulous long term plan for success. The movie is set in a different time but even a new generation of film viewers can certainly relate to the universal concepts that have been so beautifully featured in this film.",9
"Honestly, I have never heard of a movie that was so captivating and powerful to watch. The Shawshank Redemption stars Tim Robbins as a baker who is accused in murdering his wife but denies it. Morgan Freeman plays a man who has been in the Shawshank prison for many years and has given up on hope and is fighting to get out of prison by the parole hearings in the movie. Lastly, you have Bob Gunton from Ace Ventura When Nature Calls playing a warren that you would think to trust but is actually the opposite. I wont go further into describing the movie because it is very difficult to explain the whole premise and the characters. What I can say is that the plot is brilliantly paced and full of twists and turns and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I really appreciated the tone of this film having a grim, dark bleak side of Shawshank prison and the light uplifting colors outside of the prison. But, enough of the cinematography how was the acting? Without a doubt, the acting in this film was absolutely wonderful! Morgan Freeman does his voice-overs with a very poetic edge and makes the narration very entertaining. I really love Morgan Freeman's voice-overs since it shows his fantastic acting. Tim Robbins is very likable as a guy feeling that he has been framed and is dying to escape the prison. But, whats different from The Great Escape ,which is another prison escape movie, is that you don't know how he is going to escape. The way he does is absolute sheer genius! All the characters are very likable including the best supporting character in this movie that everyone can feel sympathy for. Brookes is an very complex character that I felt attached to when he left prison on parole. But, I wont spoil the rest of the movie because you must go see it for yourself! You will not be disappointed! This is one of Frank Durabont's masterpieces that would have never happened without the genius writer STEPHEN KING!!!

P.S. This movie has one of the if not the best ending I have ever seen since it touches your heart!",10
"When I first discovered IMDb I was curious on knowing the number 1 in the top 250. I saw Shawshank at 1, and I was very mad that it wasn't The Godfather. So then I downloaded it on my Mac. Me, my mother and sister saw it together.

After we watched it. I felt something inside me changed. My vision of the world changed from negative, to positive. I felt hope.

The acting was great, It had great dialogs, smart representation of the Warden and Andy's relationship, carefully explained story, and an awesome ending. I don't see any reason why you should hate it!

So then I decided to watch it again, and I could honestly say that the more you watch it, the more you'll like it! It makes you wanna go out on a rainy day and spread your arms out wide as if you yourself escaped from prison!

I really want everyone to see this movie. So that when we look at a criminal... We could see them as a person who can change the world for the better.",10
"This is the one movie i watch, to get up if i'm sad or depressed. It's certainly the best movie i've ever watched.

I think every good words that can be said about this movie already is said in the reviews here.

Highly recommend everyone to watch this.",10
"There is a reason this is rated so high, watch it for yourself!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption(1994) is an American drama movie set in 1947 and spanning 20 years of two prisoners at Shawshank who survive the place with no hope of ever coming out, but one still thrives on the 'dangerous' but 'good thing'. Based on a novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King, the movie hooks you from its very first scene. An innocent person, Andy Dufresne is convicted for two life sentences, and in the prison, he meets Red, a man who have spent almost twenty years there, and one, who has been here as long as he can remember (50 years). With a life different from anything in the outside world, the movie takes you on a tour of life of these people where corruption, hypocrisy of religion and authority, friendship and enmity are hard to miss.

Morgan Freeman as Red with a very natural acting, and Tim Robins as Andy Dufresne playing a young, bright and observant banker, the movie, written and directed by Frank Darabont has soothing background music and great cinematography.

A must, must watch.",10
"Parents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex (their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character hangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape attempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and guards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions.

In THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover, and sent to prison. It's 1949, and Andy doesn't have the stuff for prison life. Andy befriends ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and uses his past as a banker to get a job in the prison library. But things unravel. In doing the books for the warden, he learns that the prison boss is taking bribes, and Andy is to launder them. A lovable former inmate hangs himself when he gets to the outside after decades behind bars and can't adjust. The inmate whom Andy helps get his GED is shot by the guards to keep him quiet about information that might prove Andy is innocent of the murders and set him free. Andy spends two months in solitary. After he gets out, he seems depressed and Red worries he'll kill himself. The next day, Andy isn't dead, but he isn't there, either. He's escaped. The rest is a perfect Stephen King happy ending, complete with come-uppance for the corrupt warden.

Families can talk about the ways oppressed people have kept their spirit historically -- for example, through spirituals created by slaves. How do Andy and Red handle prison differently? How would you handle such a bleak future? Why did Brooks feel more comfortable in prison than out of prison? Why did Andy get Red a harmonica? What did that represent? Why did Red and Andy disagree on whether they should have hope for a better life? Did their class and race affect their approach?",10
"It's a good movie when you watch it, you enjoy it and I would watch it again. But when you think about it, it all sorts of crumbles. Why didn't Andy have a lawyer to contact? Why were none of the characters developed? And, finally: WHY IS IT CALLED A REDEMPTION IF ANDY IS INNOCENT? It redeems no one! Andy doesn't need redemption, Red doesn't either (he already is remorseful for his crime.) Why were they afraid to make Andy guilty? It would have been more believable, MUCH more plausible, and then it actually would have been a redemption! If you want a true story of redemption, read ""Les Miserables."" And, guess what, Hugo had enough talent to not need a fundamentalist Christian warden with a freaking southern accent.

Also, the ending should have cut off much earlier than it did. Maybe ""I want to see my friend again."" That would have left us wondering, did he make it? I hope he did! Instead, we actually see the stupid scene. Ugh.

The most beautiful scene of this is the Sull'aria scene... but let's face it, what director could make a scene with Mozart playing in it ugly? Except for Joel Schumacher, I suppose.",10
"One of those very rare movies, that even though you may have it on DVD or tape, you'll still stop and watch the WHOLE movie to the very end if you find it playing while 'channel surfing'. I, like everyone else I know, found out about this movie from someone else; I did not see this at the movies. So, I rented it and was (like everyone else apparently) blown away by this true cinematic masterpiece. Over the past ten years my wife and I have probably seen the movie a couple of dozen times each. If someone out there needs a 'pick-me-up' movie' (we ALL do sometimes!), then this is YOUR movie. It's always guaranteed to always remind one that ""Hope is a Good Thing....""",10
"Well, first I must admit i am no fan of drama movie cause they tend to be slow and uninteresting, but the ones i do love are just great movies that makes me either smile or break a tear. This movie is definitely the latter.

Tim Robbins and Freeman makes some powerful acting which is top notch, but what makes this movie so special except the incredible story, is that everyone perform at their best. Really hard to point out an actor who only had an average performance. Not many movies that gives so many colorful performances from all involved.

The story is really a masterpiece but to put it out so well in a movie is even harder. And the twists are surprising but makes it even better. Shows how harsh prison life was in the 40's and 50's but even though you are given a glimpse of the though conditions there is always that sense of upbeat aura in the characters and u can't help but smile on a few occasions even though there might not be much to smile about. There is so much u can say about this movie but I just say this, this is as good as drama gets.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne who was sent to Shawshank Prison for the double homicide of his cheating wife and her secret lover. But instead of feeling sorry for himself he lived the best he could and bettered the lives of fellow inmates through shear determination. In the process, he made many friends (Ellis 'Red' Redding being most notable of all) and even gained the respect of prison guards. Despite of serving back to back life sentences, Andy never gave up his ultimate dream of one day living by the ocean. That dream was further jeopardized because of what he knew, and there was someone who will go to great lengths to keep him locked up forever. Will Andy finally crack and lose hope, or will his perseverance prevail?

The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie that I've ever seen. I even like it better than any of the Godfather movies (which have a completely different theme up to the last episode). Perhaps I like this movie so much because it suits my taste. But I think most viewers of all kinds will appreciate Shawshank for the superb acting of the main characters, the insightful dialogs throughout, the powerful message it conveys, and the realness of the lives of convicts both inside the prison and outside once they're paroled.

It's a shame that Shawshank didn't win many awards since '94 was a tremendous year with the release of other great films like Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. But the acting and directing of this film was still outstanding. I can't ever imagine serving a life sentence, and prison life was much different in the mid 1900's from today. Still I was able to relate to what the main characters were feeling, and I was moved by their words and actions numerous times (especially those of Brooks).

The underlying theme of Shawshank was simple; it celebrated hope and perseverance just like Lord of the Rings. Hope and perseverance are indeed powerful elements in arts, and both films have done a marvelous job portraying these two aspects. However, Shawshank seemed more real because frankly it was set in our world and not a fantasy one. This is no knock against LOTR, but I find myself more involved in this film because I could relate to it more and it made a deeper impact on me.

******POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW******

Of course no film is perfect. There are minor details here and there than didn't make sense to me. For example, how could the wall fall apart so easily? How could Andy cut/break such a big hole through that steel pipe with a rock? How can Shawshank Prison ignore the smuggling of things (they definitely knew since there were posters on the prison walls and men were smoking smuggled cigarettes)? But these are minor things, and don't jeopardize the integrity of Shawshank.

I don't want to over-analyze Shawshank and give it away, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for a serious film. My final rating: 10/10.",10
"This movie has everything the story lines are just so unique and unpredictable yet so easy to follow, i have seen this movie many times and no matter where i start it from i know exactly what has happened and what is happening it is just so simple. the casting couldn't be any more perfect and freeman's character RED is the best, but the truth is all the cast have don't a great job at bringing the characters to life and the production and directing of this movie is second to non if i had to recommend any movie to anyone this would be it the whole thing just oozes perfection. there is little wonder why it has made its way despite its age to the top of the IMDb top movies list and there is no mistaking its brilliance the writers have done a amazing job there is little words to describe the movie except perfection. this movie gets 10 out of ten from me every time and i mean every time i see it it amazes me on how brilliant the movie is.",10
"I made my mind to watch this movie in 2012 as most of users recommended on IMDb. I always wonder what could be one thing that makes Shawshank legend of Hollywood movies. I found my favorite actor of lifetime after watching it: Morgan Freeman. Every single thing in the movie is 10/10. Story of Stephen King, screenplay, dialog, drama, suspense, crime and action. The baritone of Freeman moves whenever you hear him. I never gets tired watching it again and again, it is that kind of picture. I still sit back in ave and can't help myself from watching it again and again. Thanks to strong direction and support staff, this makes to top my list all-time.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption (based on the short story ""Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King) is quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever to grace the big screen.

Set in the mid-1900's, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is tale of Andy Dufrasne (played by Tim Robbins), a man recently convicted of a double homicide and sentenced to life in Shawshank Prison. Once there, he meets ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), a fellow inmate at the facility who is serving his own sentence, and who tells Dufrasne's story as narrator through his own eyes. The two eventually form a close friendship as they serve out their terms, and yet deal with their circumstances in different ways.

As the story goes on, the audience is treated to a culture and lifestyle that few have ever experienced, or probably even thought about. The movie goes into detail the dark side of the prison world, including corrupt guards, violence between the inmates, and even worse issues, but also shows some of the bright spots which seem to make the dreary existence of the prisoners tolerable.

The acting in this film is fantastic. Both Robbins and Freeman do magnificent jobs in their respected roles, and the inclusion of Freeman narration of the story adds a touch of credibility, as though this tale may actually be true. The movie engages the audience from beginning to end with the perfect blend of humor, sorrow, and even suspense. One moment a viewer will find themselves chuckling at a joke between the inmates, and the next cringing at the unsettling events unfolding before their eyes.

Overall, a magnificent cinematic masterpiece, and a must see for any serious movie buff.",10
"Great watch!

I've watched this countless amount of times and I never get bored of it, written greatly amongst great screenplay and monologue. Will always be one of my all time favourite films to grace us!

Characters start to develop within you and the desire to follow them into depths of acting subdue us in their thought processes and characteristics. Deserving of every award t's won and the timeless greatness its achieved on screen and in the future.

One of the bests of all time and I encourage everyone to go and watch this if they haven't already and make notes of a timeless classic!

BRAVO!",10
"I've seen The Shawshank Redemption many times, including being one of the few people who saw it in theaters when it came out. I'm a big fan of Stephen King and was well aware of the story, one of four novellas in King's ""Different Seasons"" collection. I consider it to be one of King's best works. I watched the movie again today for I don't know, maybe the tenth time. It's firmly lodged in my all-time top 20 and it seems to me to be an almost perfect film. Terrific screenplay adaptation of the story, stupendous performances from respected Academy Award-winning actors (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were never better), and brilliant direction from Frank Darabont make this classic one of the most respected films of the last thirty years. Tough to watch at times, but worth every second. I can't recommend this film strongly enough. It should not be missed by anyone who loves cinema.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most deep, incredible, inspiring, and beautiful films ever made, I cannot watch this movie without a pure smile on my face from the greatness and genius of this film. After being convicted of murdering his wife, something he denies, smart and banker Andy Duffrain (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison, which is run by a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton). He makes friends with some of the inmates but his closest relationship is with Red (Morgan Freeman) a wise lifer who is a you want it, he can get sort of guy. After many years there, and after the last straw from the warden, Andy does something that will be remembered throughout the history of Shawshank prison. The lot of this film is equally incredible with story and characters, we love whats going on the entire film because every moment is important to the ending of the film, and the characters of the movie are just perfection, Andy and Red as best friends is probably the greatest friendship I have ever seen a film and that makes it impossible to dislike them and how colorful and fun the supporting characters are, what an incredible and beautiful movie that shows the horrors of prison. The cast is just incredible, Tim Robbins plays his most memorable and best performance of his career if you ask me, and Morgan Freeman has also his greatest role to date and truly deserved his Oscar as much as everyone else that year, they were just incredible. The score of the film is not just amazing, that is not saying enough to how beautiful and masterful the music was, every minute this music was playing gave the movie its feel that made it feel like a real drama I think. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most intense and incredible dramas you will ever see, I am not resenting when I say this is my favorite drama film of all time and always will be, Frank Darabont has made many Stephen King adaptions but this is his best and his masterpiece, if you need a very inspirational and incredible film, I need you to see this film.",10
"Frank Darabont has created a masterpiece with this film.

The entire film is based upon the principle of institutionalisation, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman playing two prisoners who over many years become good friends.

From start to finish the film is gripping, moving and inspiring.

I am 24 and I usually love loud action movies etc. However you can't beat films like this and I have to admit (cue cliché) they just don't make films like this anymore.

This is my favourite film and I would recommend this to anyone who has not seen it yet to put it top of their watchlist.",10
"This movie is perfect in construction, with just the right amount of feel-goodiness added but not so much as to make one wretch. A portrait of the strength of the human spirit, and the awesome power of hope. I love the feeling of hope that this movie inspires in the viewer. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love it (still awaiting the DVD's return as I lent it to a friend about 4 months ago!) The only negative comment I've ever heard about it is the ending. Some die-hards think the movie should end with Red in the coach on his way to find Andy, but not show their meeting on the beach as its too corny. I disagree. I think that after the whole battle to escape, and wondering if they will etc, people needed the closure that seeing them meet offered. If they'd hugged and cried that would have been too much for me, but it was done perfectly. With Red, casually strolling down the beach towards Andy and starting to laugh. I'm getting goose-bumps just thinking about it now.

My favourite movie.",10
"From a purely emotional standpoint, this is quite simply the best film ever made; epic in scope, travelling as it does over many decades of our hero's lives, it does not disappoint in any area. The two films I return to again and again are this and Blade Runner, and despite their obvious differences, both films share many characteristics: sweeping score, wildly atmospheric, fantastic individual performances and both have aged beautifully. A resounding, joyful, 10 out of 10 to this phenomenal film.",9
"Phenomenal cinematography, great score, fantastic acting, all in the hands of talented filmmaker Frank Darabont, based on one of the greatest novels by revered writer Stephen King.

Completely deserving of a 10/10 rating, and deserves its #1 spot on IMDb.",10
"I don't have words to describe this precious gift given to humanity. This is more than just a movie having some divine touch. Sixth time I saw this in a dream. Every other movie seems vapid. The best a human can create. Every time I watch this movie, I get something new. This is the reason I made my IMDb account. Love you Shawshank Redemption 😘",10
"The idea of this film is to convey the state of solitude that man is, it's like the myth of Sisyphus which the Greeks and then Camus highlighted in his works. I must say that the character Andy Dufresne develops patience achievement, because with patience and look for the right time, the freedom that comes slowly after years in his master plan is won.

Such feelings which we know must bend to make the right decisions and it is there that this film achieves an impeccable staging, making paraphrase of life itself.

Speaks also of how one should live their best under the conditions, and evidently speaks about sacrifice because often we lose our status quo to achieve a goal or purpose.

In conclusion, it is a poetic film a delicacy of philosophical study of easy digestion.",10
Best drama movie with suspense. Started watching English movies because of this movie.,10
"It is hard to describe what makes Shawshank Redemption so good. It is a good movie on a lot of singular areas, but the pieces are put together in a way that makes it even more. A perfect expression of human nature's good and bad, and how fragile life seems to be.",8
The best movie i have ever seen.. touching story...,10
"Having to compete that year with such films as Forrest Gump(Also Excellent), Quiz Show(Brilliant) and Pulp Fiction(Disturbing yet a killer) Many people have shadowed this film that delivers important morals and mixed emotions. The film has a dark side to but the narration calms it side down. The film is feel good because you feel that justice has been served every time Andy has had his way. It is sad because you realize how heartless the staff of the prison is. Morgan Freeman delivers an absolutely impressive performance as a jail bird and so does Tim Robbins who plays a shy ""fish"" who evolves into an important jail man. They pull off the roles brilliantly. I did not even imagine a film like this was possible. If you have not seen this movie yet rent as soon as you can. I have never met a person who has not enjoyed The Shawshank Redemption. The Narration plays a big part in why the movie is liked by myself and many others. Goodfellas, Dances With Wolves, Forrest Gump also carried brilliant narration but Morgan Freeman's warm voice seems to beat all the others. The Shawshank Redemption is the most well written picture I have ever seen because it depicts the prisoners not as groups but as families, not as criminals but as victims and deserved more hype then it received.

It's just brilliant: the film, narration and actors",10
"For those who haven't seen this movie: STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND GO WATCH IT.

One of the must see movies for many reasons. The characters are well written, the relationships between them feels very natural. Even though the film takes place in the jail every character changes and progress throughout the story.

The movie makes you see the human side of a person behind the tag of ""criminal"", the agony, the hope of anyone marginalized from society trying to fight back the injustices of the system and break free from the tyrants who patronize him/her.",10
"Awe-inspirting story, wonderful performances. Simply astonishing. Persistence, patience, hope, tolerance and creativity, if well combined can really set you free.",10
"I liked this film very much...until the end. I thought, ""NO! Please don't give us a fairytale ending!"" For me, the film should have ended after Red found what Andy had left for him, or maybe showing him on his way to be reunited with Andy. The scene on the beach was out of character with the rest of the film, even though Andy had talked about it earlier. And HE IS WORKING ON SOME PIECE OF SH*T BOAT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?! HOW did it get there? I thought, ""WHY such an ending to what up to now had been a great film? So I was very relieved when I discovered that Frank Darabont wanted a different ending, and it was the studio wanted it that way (how many times has THAT happened in the history of Hollywood -- f*cking up a good thing).",10
It touched my heart it fullfilled my heart with all type of emotions you can find sadness anger depressing happiness excitement it is very directed with perfectism with proper editing screenplay and music is what makes this movie special .It brilliantly potrays the idea power of hope this all movie is about hope if you are a prisoner only hope will save you so you damn have hope in you.The dialougesbetween main characters is special seeing their bond grow break again grow by meeting a friend after long time with consent of hope if you watch this movie carefully you will find this movie 's power on your mind. As Andy Dufrene said __ fear can hold you prisoner but hope can set you free..............,10
"In my eyes, a marvelous film, but one of the best, if not the best film ever made? I wouldn't agree. I think there are a number of films with better stories, characters, meanings and film making out there. I think the incredible following behind this film has come became this is a film that can appeal to just about anyone. It is, perhaps ""impossible"" to hate. Where someone may watch 2001 and find it boring or too ambiguous, or may find the likes of Citizen Kane, The Godfather or Lawrence of Arabia to be overly long snooze fests, on average the number of these reactions are greatly reduced by a film like Shawshank because of its happy, neatly tied up ending and it most people may find it more entertaining.

Please do not get me wrong, I do think this is a great film, and when I watch it I cannot find flaws AT ALL. I do not think though that a flawless movie is automatically the best movie, Pulp Fiction I would say is a better film, but still has little flaws here and there, like Butch Coolidge's uninteresting girlfriend getting a little too much screen time.

What I love about this film is how it depicts prisoners, prisoners that have been sentenced to decades of isolation from the outside world. The film never really wants the audience to sympathize with any of the characters except Andy Dufresne, whom we know, or at least assume, is an innocent man. The film shows that prison, for a lot of these men, become their home, and they cannot withstand the outside world. The character Brooks goes into prison early in his adult life, but comes out when he's an elderly man, and cannot handle how much the world has changed, its things like this that I appreciate about this film.

I greatly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, however, I do not believes that this film deserves the #1 spot on the IMDb Top 250, for me it should be around the 70-80 mark, but that's just my opinion.",8
"This movie is great. A complete masterpiece, the players are carefully selected and deserves the first place. Especially when the film-in heads have a normal turn, especially the last half hour. Everyone has to watch before they die.

I can not think of anyone else in this role in Tom Hanks.Morgan Freeman In seems to be a little passive, but the director could not use it effectively. There is little action in the film, but this lack is closed with its own mystery and fluency.",9
"It rarely happens that I remember how a movie made me feel. But I remember the feeling this movie gave even years after. Or rather feelings. It made me angry and calm, sad and happy at the same time. How can a movie make you feel contradicting feelings at all at once?

There might be movies with more action, excitement, better cinematography etc. But no other movie has ever made me feel the way I felt the first time I watched it.

It's a true masterpiece and deserves the number one spot as the best movie of all times.

I simply love this calm, emotional, surprising movie.",10
"This movie gives you insipiration and motivates you, that you're able to accomplish anything in life by putting your mind to it, the story-line in this movie is fantastic, very entertaining and can be watched over and over again, deserves the title 'Greatest movie of all time', and nothing is able to beat it's reviews and ratings yet. 10/10 - Iky",8
"I had nothing to do the other night so I thought - hey, I feel like watching a good (and boy did I mean GOOD) movie. So I browsed the IMDb to see what I could find. 'The Shawshank Redemption' was one of only two movies which had more than 9/10 on average. I decided to watch this 2 hour long piece of work.

The audience is brought in to the movie at once, something which I really appreciate in movies. In 'The Shawshank Redemption' you will follow Andy who was convicted for the murderer of his wife and her lover. It appears that Andy is innocent so in jail (named Shawshank) a struggle to become free again is started.

'The Shawshank Redemption' is deep, funny and very smart. It brings up many messages about hope, friendship and fear. I strongly recommend you devote 2 hours of your life for this movie.

9 out 10.",10
"The flop on the box office that this movie had taught me to pay less attention to the money when judging movies. This story teaches us about the possibility of redemption, the importance of our moral character and, most importantly, hope («always a good thing»). With monstrously perfect acting and narration from Morgan Freeman, this movie crushes a lot of preconceptions and forces the viewer to think about matters we like not to think about: the flaws of the judicial system, the reality of prisional institutions, inmate rehabilitation/humanization and the suffering of inocents who get wrongfully locked up. Out right top 5 best movies all-time",10
This film is filled with all kinds of emotions. No doubt this is simply a masterpiece. The movie has shown what a knowledgeable man can do. Definately made me a better person within.,10
"I don't know what else to say other than ; I loved it. No matter how many times I've seen it, I'll always love it. It's one of my favorite prison movies ever.",10
If you havent seen this movie you honestly need too. I am 20 Years Old and i just got around to seeing this movie last night. Obviously i was born after this movie was released and i am very sceptical about older movies but i decided to give it a watch....needless to say i will probably rewatch this movie tonight at midnight. This was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. Everything from the opening scene to the ending scene was incredible. Just another staple and gem to add to the morgan freeman collection. If i could rate this higher than a 10 i most likely would have. This was a fantastic movie,9
"I'm not exaggerating it when I say this is the most amazing thing I have ever been exposed to. The Shawshank Redemption is a moving, deeply emotional drama faithfully adapted from the equally brilliant novella by Stephen King. It would probably take all my strength to not punch someone in the face for saying anything against this film.",10
"No other film has uplifted me more then the end of this movie, its a movie everyone should see at least once in there lives. The way this film explores its themes: hope, redemption, grief ets, it does so incredibly well. The characters are very memorable, the performances are all great, the music is perfect in the way it's used, it hits all the right emotions where it needs too. If you are feeling down, I'd recommend this, the ending is one of my favourites. Hardly anyone at all dislikes this film, I've yet to meet that person.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. 10/10",10
"I can watch this over and over. The cast, the writing, directing, the story is spot on. I loved the ending. Never gets boring or old, full of emotion. Excellent movie.",9
Took me 20 years to realize he was guilty. And four times to watch. And couple king movies. Duphrenes killed his wife and lover.,10
"Few films capture the triumph of the human spirit the way that The Shawshank Redemption did. Not only was it an original true-to-life story, it added a touch of comedy and a heart-warming story of friendship. At first, I expected little from this movie (granted I was 12), but it has quickly grown into my very favorite movie of all time; and it competes with Schindler's List and GoodFellas for the best movie of the decade. As the 90's come to an end, we see a familiar theme in cinema: destruction and armageddon (literally); it is good to see a reversal in a beautiful film from promising young talent (Darabont).",10
"I really enjoyed this movie. There was obviously a lot of thought put into the script and it delivers brilliantly. The directing is also wonderful, and the actors fit the part perfectly. This is a gruesome account of prison life in the 1950's-60's that is very violent, although this was necessary in the film. A very good movie, and a must-see!",9
"This film is a beautiful story about what faith and hope and passion are about. The struggle between the desire for something more and the resignation about your lot in life. On many levels this film challenges you to both seize the day and overcome fear and limitations about yourself. All without a preach-y tone or a moralistic attitude and with lots of interesting characters and action. This movie also offers insight into the truth that can be found in a real friendship.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone.",10
"This is storytelling done right.

Character development, performances and plot line all supercede any film ever made.

The plot twist at the end will always go down in history as one of the greatest reveals of all time. Hearing that piece fall through the ""Hollow"" - amazing.",10
"I remembered reading Stephen King's original short story many moons before I saw the screen translation, but I'm very thankful that I couldn't remember the twist towards the end. The discovery as to what Andy's posters were REALLY used for totally changes the feel of the film, and I defy anyone to be unmoved.

This is easily the best King screen adaption, and is hardly likely to be bettered. It really is excellent, and it's hard to know what to praise it for most, but it's perhaps the only film I've ever seen that made my heart soar at the fate of it's main characters as if they were real people.

As I write this, The Shawshank Redemption has been voted the #1 film on IMDB, which is a very pleasing surprise as it really is deserved.",10
"Apologies to all proud Anglophiles, but I have never heard the English language sound so beautiful as during Freeman's narration in the last 20 minutes. Our language has to compete with beautiful languages like Italian, Spanish and French and Darabont's writing really ""stepped up to the plate"" here.

No clichéd romantic tragedy of unrequited love had to unfold (there was only ONE female speaking role!!!). Only a story of friendship, hope and inner strength was needed to bring tears to the eyes during the final narration.

Unlike many movies of the nineties, this movie gets its strength from fantastic characterisation, great pen-to-paper skills and Deakin's cinematography; words and pictures, not 200 gigabtyes of cyber-FX!

Despite my admiration of James Cameron, this movie beats ""Titanic"" as well as classics like ""Casablanca,"" ""African Queen,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Gone with the Wind,"" and Hitchcock's ""North by Northwest.""",10
"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.",10
"I happened to see this film on TV not too long ago. My husband was watching so I thought I would sit down and watch. I was absolutely blown away by this film Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were super!! It was well acted well edited. This is one of the most outstanding movies I have seen in recent years.

I purchased the video and have watched numerous times. The conclusion of this film had me on the edge of my seat. JUST OUTSTANDING!",10
"This is, without a doubt, one of the most gripping movies that I've ever seen. The script is well written and proves once again that Stephen King is a masterful story teller. I've definitely seen a few King movies that have left a bit to be desired, but this is not it. King is at his best on this one.

Let's not forget the stunning performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. There couldn't be a better pairing then these to gentlemen. This was a defining role for Robbins as he broke out of his typical `funny movie' role and proved without a doubt that he is an actor in every sense of the word. I gained new respect for this man after seeing this movie and gladly see anything he does.

Morgan Freeman succeeded in further cementing himself in my mind as one of the great actors of today. He makes you believe that the saying is true; `They sentence you to life and that's exactly what they get.'

Don't take my word for it, see it for yourself. Don't just rent it, though, buy it because you'll have to own it once you've seen it and there's no sense in throwing away your money on the rental.",10
"It is tough to summarize the true power of this truly great film. It was moving, thought-provoking, and powerful. It was truly robbed of the 1994 Best picture, just because Forrest Gump was more succesful in theatres. Shawshank was much deeper, and i was a great injustice. Shawshank chronicled the relationship between two jailed inmate through the 40's, 50's and 60's. It was a film about how no matter how hard a man is broken, beaten down, and crushed emoionally he still can keep hope. I truly loved this film and it grows better with each viewing. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave great performances in this film. Frank Darabot had great direction over this film, and Stephen King's short story was great. This is a must see for anyone. Like I said before this is in my opinion the greatest fim ever made.",10
"This film was honestly able to make me laugh, and cry. It moved me from start to finish. I have seen several films in my lifetime, and I have given this film the distinct honor of my favorite, and the best film of all time. It shows the character development and friendship between inmates of several years. Everyone should see this film, because It is incredible. The scene where they are drinking beers never fails to make me cry or at least get teary-eyed.",1
"I have for a long time that Shawshank Redemption is the best movie based on IMDb scores, but I always stopped myself to watch it.

Finally, tonight I watched it I think it is one of the only movies which are deserved to get score above 8.

""Remember. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""",10
"Let me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time favorites and as such I may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. On the other hand, there's a reason it's a personal favorite.

The movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbins) for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's life in prison, relationships with other inmates (particularly with ""Red"" played perfectly by Morgan Freeman) and passion for life and freedom.

I recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. He claimed it was ""too plain"" to be considered so great; my view was (and is) that it maybe be plain, but it's superb. The movie touched me when I saw it, Brooks' long life in prison (amazing acting by James Whitmore), Red's pragmatic persona and Andy's unyielding will and hope, all combines to an amazing movie.

In my opinion this isn't some regular ""feel good movie"", it's much more. It may be plain as my friend said, low on visual effects or outstanding camera work – but it's plainly superb. The texts send shivers down your spine, Frank Darabont's screenplay adaption to Stephan King's short story are brilliantly executed by the amazing cast and in the end that's what really matters.

I was moved when the movie ended, viewed it and prison differently, I expect it'll remain as a cult favorite despite the ""no impressive effects and mediocre camera work"" as my friend put it.

Go watch it if you haven't already, it's in my opinion one of the best movies of all time.",10
"This is the most inspiration and motivational movies in the world in my opinion. there are a lot lesson learn revealed in this movie.

In all movies where as always Morgan Freeman the STAR would be the brilliant and shinning star.""Morgan freeman just like a must spice in every food""

Appointed from Stephen King's best-selling novel. Shawshank redemption is an inspiring film which will make you understand what is meant by a true friend. Not many people know that the Shawshank redemption movie is the highest rating film, which is 93, on IMDB. IMDB is a site that provides the value of a film's performance. It is not surprising if this film is the best film of all time. The horrifying background of the prison really makes the audience bewitched by the intelligence of the film directed by Frank Darabont.

A banker who spent nearly twenty years at Shawshank State Prison over the murder of his wife and affair even though he claimed not to do so. For those of you who have watched it, you will surely be amazed by this one movie. Broadly speaking, this film tells the experience of a well-known banker Andi Dufresne who had to stay in jail for his wife's murder case. His meeting with a prisoner named Ellis 'red' redding made his life in prison better. I can't even remember how many time i had watched this movies.",10
"When this movie first cam eout, I didn't know much about it, my mother, who had seen it, had mentioned something about it being ""very good"" amd a ""prison movie."" I managed to catch it abotu a year later on the Movie Channel, I have to tell you, I sat in awed silence for the next two hours.

Shawshank Redemption isn't just a movie about a bunch of guys in a prison, it's a movie about hope, friendship, and ""coming through clean in the end."" The film is slightly over two hours long, and involving an amazing cast of well acted characters, amazing aerial shots, a wonderful score of music, and inspiration, and the ability to find strength in yourself, that maybe you didnt' know was there. It was a shame this film came out the same year as Forrest Gump, this deserved every award it was nominated for, I highly recommend to anyone to see this film, because it is among one of the best i've ever seen.",10
"After reading reviews countlessly recommending the reader to watch this film if they hadn't already I decided to dedicate some time and money to get the film on blu-ray and sit down with some food and drink and prepare to admire a so called ""masterpiece"". I wasn't disappointed....a lot.

The film grips you from the beginning, the story line promising, good actors being introduced right left and center, however the film has its moments where some sub plots make you lose interest, I found myself drifting off into a day dream a couple of times throughout the film. However then it got back on track sensing a great finale which it delivered.

I still thoroughly enjoyed the film and believe 8/10 is justified, it is by no means perfect and by no means the best, but it is up there and I do recommend it.",7
I can't tell you how everything about this movie is just perfect.Best movie of all time,10
"The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.

By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.

While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.

With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org",8

"am i one of the few who watched this at a cinema? Watched at the now closed Odeon, Haymarket on a Wednesday when I had nothing better to do and know very little about the film apart from a Geordie mate kept raving about it. With limited expectations, I came out totally enthralled by a magnificent cinematic experience - one that you all too rarely enjoy. To me you have to take inspiration from Defrene; no matter how tough your situation is, you need to focus on what you want to achieve and retain the belief that your dreams can come true. The scene on top of the roof, drinking beer is tops. Only wish I knew where my son has posted the DVD! We have to watch it on video now!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.",1
"It is so good. Andy, Red, Heywood, Brooks, Jake, Warden. Nuff Said",10
"This is honestly one of the worst movies that I have ever seen in my life! Everything about it is a step down from the book! I much prefer the Stephen King's genius novel because it has nuance, charm, and is told in an actually engaging way.

The film, on the other hand, is a complete mess and has no idea what it wants to be. The story follows to many characters, but not in a way that makes it seem interesting or smart. It can't decide which character it wants to tell the story from. In the novel, the story had many intriguing surprises because it was told through Red's point of view. In the film, the story shows too much of Andy Dufresne and ends up detracting from the story and his development as a character.

Even the music is cliche, uninspiring, and thinks it's much more important than it actually is. In one specific scene, the music ends up draining the scene of all possible emotional weight or significance because it draws attention to itself in a way that it feels more annoying and loud than heartfelt and sincere.

The color palette is also dull, drab, and lifeless. It only makes viewers want to watch this film less and takes any enjoyment or humor/happiness from the characters away. The acting is also poor and unsubtle. Morgan Freeman has the only few scenes where the acting isn't God-awful. If only the screenplay didn't take out all of the nice, smart, and engaging parts of the novel and replace them with cliche, dull, useless things in the film, this could have been a mildly entertaining/enjoyable watch.

Please do not watch this film if you haven't already or if you value your time and great cinema.

"If you have not seen this film yet, you are really missing something in your life. It is almost like never tasting Coca Cola.

This film is that good. The great Morgan Freeman not only puts in the greatest acting performance of his life, but quite possibly the greatest performance of all time.

The script is so excellent that every word spoken sticks in your mind and later on in the movie you remember every word before it is recollected.

This film makes you angry, upset, romantic, sick and elated. It touches all of the senses and you cannot take your eyes off the screen for one minute.

The cinematography is excellent and so is the research and hard work that has gone into ensuring that all of the costumes and props are of the era.",9

why? because the whole movie is entertaining there is no part that makes you bored is the best film and is one of the best story told on film. and the way its narrating is great Morgan freeman's voice is like flowers,and his performance too and trim Robbins is great too the way that you see his face,the face of having a secret and you don't even know whats gonna happen even the supporting cast like James withmore and i don't wanna spoil so I'm just gonna tell he gives really dramatic performance,i really cant believe it didn't won anything at the Oscars it was one of the most silent unfamous films of the Oscars. and besides you love the character and u cant deny it.

"jake1st@yahoo.com asked: ""Finally, can someone please tell me how he got that poster of Racquel Welch back on the wall after he climbed frontways into that tunnel?""

For someone who was apparently closely observing this film, you should have noticed how it was attached to the wall. It was hanging from above. Thus Andy Dufresne would only have to lift it up (like a flap) and it would flap back down behind him.

Watch it again if you don't believe me. I believe this is shown twice, if not more.",10
"This is definitely one of the greatest films of all time.

I watched it again for the second time last night, and was thrilled to see some scenes which I'd completely forgotten about.

The story is gripping, and it's superb how it unfolds. The acting can't be faulted, and the music really gives it a monumental feel. Brooks is a great character, as are all of the characters really, but if I had to pick one out, Brooks is the man.

Not only is it entertaining, the subplots are great and there are some classic lines. Like the warden at the start: ""There are two things I believe in; discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.""

A classic.",7

However, this movie has one of the best scenes in cinema, and i really loved it. but, is that it!! this is what the movie got!! just one scene!! it's really overrated, no kidding.",9
"Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is found guilty of murdering his wife, and sentenced to Shawshank for life. He's innocent, but unable to clear his name. So off he goes, to one of the most horrible prisons in the country. At first the other inmates don't show him any respect, as they think he's just a snob. But he manages to get one friend, Red (Morgan Freeman), who he become very close to. During his time in prison he finds different ways of spending his time, such as building a library, helping the guards with their tax reports and putting up posters of pretty girls on his cell wall...

Tim Robbins preformance in this movie was the best I've ever seen. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 13, and at the time I had no clue of who he was or when this movie was made, but after seeing it I decided to become an actress. Later I found out he was Tim Robbins and that the movie weren't made in the 60's (as I thought...). I guess that was when my admiration for Tim Robbins began. Today I have seen alot more of his work and still believe he's my hero as much as I did that day when I first saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

All the other actors were also really great, and the script is amazing. The scenes are amazing. Everything about this movie is amazing. You can see it over and over again, and still be amazed everytime. This is one of those movies you have to see at least once a year. Just to experience how truly amazing it is.",10
"This film is a true work of art, everything here is very well worked that makes this story remain engraved in your memory and you will never forget it.

The great work of the actors is something to admire and acclaim, they are really people who love acting so much and are good at their work and this movie is a clear example of it.

For me, it is the best adaptation of one of Stephen King's stories, the book is also brilliant and this movie lives up to the book.

The best movie in history for me and I don't think there is one that surpasses it.",6

However having watched it on recommendation from a friend, I was staggered at how good this movie is. I don't know what it was, but something grabbed hold of me and made me appreciate this movie. Tim Robbins is excellent as Andy Dufresne and he never won an Academy Award is beyond me.

After all the cliched buddy-buddy movies made in the 80's, it's nice to be able to sit down and watch a tale of genuine and lasting friendship.",10
"Just watched this film for the second time so that I could answer the technical questions I had the first time about why certain characters did something and why. Pay attention. It is fascinating.

Aside from that, I easily give this film a #1 ranking on my personal list of favorites. I noticed that ""The Godfather"" is #1 on this web site. I strongly disagree because that film simply glorifies organized crime violence, while ""Shawshank"" is very, very moving, philosophical, challenging, and has MANY messages to get across to the viewer. This second time round, here are the messages which I gained from this film (from most obvious to highest level order):

1) State prison is horrible. 2) If you can't do the time, then don't do the crime (or even be associated by circumstantial evidence to the crime). 3) If you ever find yourself in prison, better to make friends than to make enemies - your life my depend on it. 4) Sometimes violence is absolutely unnecessary and wrong. 5) Every human being needs friends and acceptance. 6) What comes around, goes around. 7) Police officers and prison guards who themselves become convicted criminals have little chance of survival in prison - suicide for them is the more attractive option. 8) Hope can help anyone rise above any bad situation. 9) Every life is precious and irreplaceable. 10) Society can treat you like a piece of sh@t, can tell you that you are a piece of sh@t, and can even drag you through half a mile of sh@t, but you are NEVER a piece of sh@t until you THINK that you are a piece of sh@t.",10
This movie is amazing! This movie even with its rating is still underrated. Spectacular movie. 20/10 if I could.,10
"It's an escape film without action, thrills or suspense, even though we're aware that he's digging off screen. It's more of a collective story than memorable moments. The characters are good and the performances solid, though not demanding as a lot of it's in the narration. Only the Brooks part's really evoking and perhaps the bit playing the record, as the tone's that of a harsh setting. The inner worry and satisfaction Andy must feel as the warden and guard are in his cell next to the poster, gives more weight to the record scene as all that work could've been for nothing if they took away everything. Though knowing they didn't find out perhaps kept his sanity while in isolation.",10
"While ""the Godfather"" is the current number 1, I have to say that, although I love the Godfather, it never gives me the same feeling as ""The Shawshank Redemption"". It gives me goosebumps everytime I see it. You actually pitty the inmates, even when you know what they did. But the best part of the experience is the way the story let's you be Red and look at the terribly strange new inmate and watch him give everyone a better life.",10
"I have had this movie on my watch list for a long while now and only just got round to it, an epic movie with a cast that just immerses you into their lives, sorrows, fears and hopes. The movie has so many little messages in it but for me the overwhelming message it gives is that no matter how high the walls, how deep the fear you always have hope. You feel all the emotions the inmates go through the harsh reality and at the same time the security blanket routine and a regime gives you. The characters all had so much depth I just wish I had watched this sooner! A movie that will stay with you and you and you can revisit time and time again.",10
This movie shows the power of hope in humans. Human can make anything possible if he believe in himself. It also depicts with resiliency and strong will power you can achieve your goal. Very inspiring movie.,9
"The movies doesn't feel anywhere near 2hr 30m, the movie is never boring, and there's not one second where you don't feel what Andy, Red, or even characters that are considered ""minor"" like Brooks. That's what makes the ending so satisfying for these two beloved characters. Yesterday was my second viewing of the film in my life time and nothing in the movie makes it less entertaining than the first viewing. This movie is able to make you feel every emotion there is and that's what makes it one of my favorite movies of all time, 10/10.",10
"I love reading and watching movies based on Stephen King books.

What an interesting film! The cast is incredible! The film has a parallel with life itself - someone chooses to go with the flow, and someone will achieve some goals and not give up. Such people inspire and make you reach for them. The film ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is certainly about such a person.",10
"This movie is an ode about perseverance and hope.

I recommend this movie for every people",10
"Whenever I see a prison or even think about it, the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. Maybe it's because I have watched this masterpiece so many times that it's actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film is made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact that it is based upon ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by them. I still can't believe that it never got any major accolade and didn't even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which can't be missed.",2
People need to know that this hopeful prison story is a great and disturbing movie. The language in this film is not horrible but its definitely not great the way the language is used can be in many different ways it's some times used in a sexual way sometimes used in a violent or angry way and sometimes just used in dialogue. The violence in this film can range from rape to beatings to shootings and to disturbing hangings and suicides that should not be taken lightly. When it comes to the sexual content there's nothing really except some lewd jokes and the rape scenes but that goes under violence there's also a bit of sexual dialogue during the rape scenes. There's also not that many drugs except lots of cigarettes because one of the character runs a cigarette trade through the prison. Overall this film is disturbing sad great happy and violent all at the same time and is a great film with great actors and a great story line.,10
"I saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. I just happened to see it by chance on cable because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. After watching the movie I was immensely impressed and positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""!

The movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson to take home. Wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the blood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays.

Thanks for reading this review.",10
"Haven't seen this for a couple years, guess I should give it a try again. It was enjoyable and clever at turns, but a little formulaic. I was also very bothered by the lack of racism portrayed in the film. Racism is a very bad thing, but it was also so very pervasive in the 1930's that portraying it as basically nonexistent is tantamount to historical revisionism. That left a bad taste in my mouth.",10
"After I watched this masterpiece I asked myself this question and so my answer is :

I don't know

Everything felt so organic and wrong at the same time .

It didn't felt like Endgame ,I didn't expect to feel like this ,but the vibe was ... kind of weird .Everything was so slow ,but I never got bored .

Honestly I could never tell if this is the best movie I have ever seen or it's total garbage .

When you haven't seen it I tell you : Watch it or watch it later.",10
"Love this movie so much, I would die to watch this movie for the first time again. Acting and directing a 10/10. The ending is spectacular and the overall movie want me craving a sequel. Favourite movie of all time, even ahead of morbius! Nah I'm kidding. But seriously though, this movie is fantastic.",9
"Shawshank Redemption is quite possibly the best movie ever made. This includes all time frames and genres. There are no flaws in this story; only brilliance. It's simply a remarkable story. It's a timepiece feature with an amazing cast. Character development is top-notch. The story line and delivery are extraordinary. I wish I could re- watch this movie over again as if I had never seen it before, so do yourself a favor... if you're watching this movie or plan to watch this movie for the first time... turn off your phone, dim the lights and be prepared to be amazed. It's an enriching story with adult content that is suitable for older kids. You will laugh. You will cry. You will get angry. And... you will feel love, hope and redemption unlike any movie you have ever seen before. Shawshank Redemption is unforgettable.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film that has stood the test of time. With a complex and engaging plot, it tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sent to the Shawshank prison.

The film is anchored by strong performances from Robbins and Morgan Freeman, who play Andy and his friend and fellow prisoner, Ellis Boyce. The chemistry between the two actors is electric, and their bond is one of the most memorable aspects of the film.

One of the standout elements of The Shawshank Redemption is its unique and thought-provoking exploration of the prison system. It tackles themes of hope, friendship, and the power of the human spirit, and it does so with a deft touch that avoids heavy-handed moralizing.

The only downside to the film, at least for a younger viewer like myself, is that I had already seen many references to the iconic scene of Andy digging through the wall with a spoon. Despite this, the film remains a powerful and moving work that is well worth watching. Overall, I would give it a rating of 8 out of 10.",10
"Best movie I've ever watched in my life! I know it is such a high compliment but this film truly deserves it. For people who think that Stephen King only writes horror stories, you are terribly wrong... Even though this movie is less complicated than other supernatural fiction or fantasy movies of him, the positive message it delivers is far beyond the others. Andy Dufresne is the strongest character in the movie industry, not physically but mentally. He always full of hope and never lose faith when facing every obstacle. This movie is undoubtedly brilliant, not only with great storytelling, but also how it changed people mind after watching it. I always love movies with satisfying endings, and its ending is really mind blowing. Every time when I'm facing difficulties and decided to give up, I always recall of this movie. What Andy has done to improve the environment of Shawshank prison and also the life of those prisoners indicates a wonderful philosophy of life. I agreed that people might afraid of uncertainty and changes when they've been staying in their comfort zone for a long period of time. Nevertheless, no one should be 'institutionalised'. There is full of opportunities in the outside world waiting for you to explore. I hope everyone is able to love this movie like I do. I hope everyone never lose hope in every situation because no good thing ever dies. I hope.",10
"This movie is absolutely the best movie I've ever seen. I can't help but sit down through this whole movie and not get up once even though I've seen it over and over again. Every part of the movie I'm saying to myself ""I can't get up now, this is my favorite part"". Although, my two favorite parts are the beer scene and the end of the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go out and buy it. Don't rent it, you won't take it back!",9

The actors are brilliant , Director und Screenplay A+.The suspense is how should always be in such movies.I personally like the end at most.Morgan Freeman play very good his role and Tim Robbins he should make more acting i almost forgot him as a actor and he is so talented,at age but look at Freeman.I recommend this movie to all.It's one of those movies you shouldn't miss.",10
"This is my favorite movie of all time and I have viewed it many times. It is the only movie that produced quotes which I use in my life. This movie flows from beginning to end, the characters are perfectly cast, and the story line is impeccable. Can you imagine anyone other than Morgan Freeman doing the narration for this movie? Anyone else as Andy Dufresne? Get busy living or get busy dying..Damm Right! This movie has one of the best final scenes ever filmed.",10
"Shawshank redemption trys to be so many thing and its so boring, those jokes dont land and it is easily one of the most cringey movies ever with its corny messages and bad visuals. On the other hand ferris buelers big day off is a cinematic movie that has good jokes that land, and it is much less cringey with better visuals and great charecter development that will make sure you feel intwined with the movie at all time and make sure you feel that it is one with you, ferris buelers big day off is a truly cinematic masterpeice that is one of the greatest movies of all time that is why i belive it much better than shawshank redemption!",10
"What is so special about this movie? Thats what I asked myself when I saw it as one of the few IMDB top-rated movies I didn't know yet. Now I know why it deserves to be there. It is the best prison movie ever made. Most prison movies try to accuse the prison system by showing an increasing level of violence and spectacular escapes. Shawshank Redemption is somewhat different. The main actor is portrayed from the view of a second person and most of the time we see what this person sees. Shawshank prison is not a monastery, and while there are some violent scenes, most of the violence we only learn by the narrative of the second person. The time saved from depicting violence is spent showing the feelings of the inmates. Beyond the perfect technical work in producing this movie, the plot slowly builds up to incredible moments of courage and purity. I guess this is what essentially makes the movie so great, without being pathetic the movie makes us wonder about our own motives and decisions. Very thought provoking.",10
"This movie not only had a very good story line, but also the way story was told to the audience was commendable. i have not seen many movies which you want to watch again, but this sure was.

After you watch the movie and know what Andy actually was upto, you would want to actually watch it again to see how good actors (especially Andy) acted in those scenes.

Movie revolves around Andy who is a hot shot banker, convicted for his wife's murder and subsequently sent for two life sentences back to back in Shawshank Prison. Andy who by his level of education and IQ gets gifted with both friends and enemies inside the walls, gels up well with Red, who gets a lot of things done for Andy. Warden also is impressed with Andy and starts a scam with his help to launder money into his pocket.

In between, the brawl with ""gang of sisters"" the homosexuals who try to assault Andy and Reds group, with who Andy starts to get along with pretty well, play a very important part in the story.

After twenty years, a young boy who somehow knows and could testify Andy's innocence comes to Shawshank Prison for committing some felony. Warden gets him killed and covers up the crime with 'that boy trying to break free' story.

By this time Andy gets ready for his revenge with Warden and his final step.

Story unfolds.

I would like everybody who watches this to watch this movie twice, so that they can understand the true essence of storytelling. Must tell you that, I was more thrilled when I watched it for second time, as I could understand things which were puzzling me for the first time.

Brilliantly told, Meticulously Acted and Highly Recommended.",10

"Well, I don't really give 10/10 for every film. Yes, there are few who I would give 10/10 for like Back to The future, The Green Mile, 12 angry men and Forrest Gump but this movie is something else. it really tops them all. I have no idea how this didn't win Best Picture in 1994. I mean, pulp fiction and Forrest Gump are great but this one is simply magnificent. It is the definition of hope and redemption. no matter how things go south on you in life you got to keep that little piece of hope to go on. The performances of Freeman and Tim Robbins are really beautiful. Frank Darabont one of my favorite directors put on one of the greatest performances to date though he hasn't directed many movies in his lifetime but it is really about the quality and not the quantity.

So, if you would like to see a real film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, gives you hope and enjoy a real film experience you got to watch the greatest movie in my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption.",10
"I won't say it's the best film ever, but The Shawshank Redemption is certainly the best film *I've* ever seen. There are no big stunts, no state-of-the-art special effects, no naked women.... In fact there are none of the things that are normally ""required"" to make a film commercial. (Perhaps this accounts for its modest showing at the box office.) What it *has* got is humanity, subtlety and a great story with a brilliant payoff! One of the first DVDs I ever bought and by far the most played.",10
"Well. I don't have anything to say but, the movie was 100% great. Morgan Freeman is the man. Superb acting & great story with everyone in the family can watch this movie together. Anyone haven't watched this classic movie, please watch it. It's worth it buying the original DVD from Amazon or CD Universe. The script is greatly done. Movies like this are more offently released. I watched it twice & I have the original DVD with me. Talking about ""Stephen King"" great writer & I loved his films such as ""Secret Window"", ""Red Rose"", ""The Mist"", ""Pet Semetary"" are some of the movies I really preferred watching. The good thing is that this movie are released by all the good production companies like Castelock Entertainment, Warner Brothers & 20th Century Fox.

That's all. Again great movie. Watch it!!!",10
"This movie is excellent. It really makes you feel good. It's about hope, the fight for life and most of all, poetical justice. Excellent performances by the cast, visually stunning and has a great deal of realism in it. I totally recommend it. A+",10
"This is probably my favorite film and deserves all credit is gets on this site and more. It gets no mentioning from AFI or other official lists, but I would easily put it in the top 10. It is probably the most riveting story in a movie ive seen, from the beginning you are on Tim Robbins side and how can you deny that both he and Morgan Freeman give the best performances of their lives.",10
"Such a great film. Great acting, great cinematography, the list goes on and on. Undoubtedly a great film, not necessarily good enough for #2 of all time, but great. Don't miss this one. I give it 10 out of 10.",9
"This movie for me was a really great drama. Although some people would act as though this freaking movie was genius, which in my opinion is a little bit over rated. Tim Robbins does do a great job in seeming as though hes just a good guy, and morgan freeman, well hes just morgan freeman in another role. The movie is a tad bit long and the action is none. But the acting is great and the ending is to pretty great. I liked this movie a lot but I did not finish this movie thinking that it was one of the best films of all time, like I was led to believe. All in all it was a great film that I give an 8 or just below that, like a 7.9. So as long as you got the bong out and some munchies and your not a punk kid with A.D.D. which by the way I have myself. You should definitely like this one. Two Blunts up.",9
"As a lover of film, I find it hard to remember my feelings regarding most of the films I ever seen. Not so with this film. This is your classic, 'what's this mum you've got from the video shop, never heard of it, can't be arsed to watch it.' Ring any bells? I first saw this film about six years ago, and I remember as it neared the final scene on the beach, the tears in my eyes. It is simply the most moving film I have ever seen, I think because this is the end we all wanted, but never thought possible. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are brilliant, I think Freeman has the best voice-over tone around. How this film did not win any Oscars is beyond me, it will always be one of my all-time favourite films, just brilliant. The line, 'Get busy living, or get busy dying,' sums up the whole film, and it is a message for all; never give up hope for a redemption, and friendship will conquer all troubles.

Anybody who hasn't seen this film, just go and see it for God's sake. Anybody who doesn't like it - you don't really like films do you? A tad long is THE only minor criticism, but I think the length adds drama. You have to sit down and watch this all the way through not in bits for the full effect.

Quite simply the best film I have ever, and will ever see. 10/10.",10
"With this film, cinema reached its top. The plot, the characters, the directing, the acting, the message that the movie contains, everything is capable to make a person get stuck on it from the beginning to the end. Frank Darabont introduces himself to the world as a genius with this piece of art in the year of 1994. Morgan Freeman proves himself once again as a great actor in movie industry, as well as Tim Robbins. All the people involved made a terrific job. Stephen King couldn't imagine that his tale could be adapted in such a perfect way. The more you see it, the more you may want to see it again. It's a movie to feel. It's a movie to think about, all the times in your life when you think there's no escape. It's a movie to put a smile on your face, despite all the sadness that may exist. It is perfection, and the greatest movie of all time.",10
"I, like most of the people I have known in the past thirty years or so that discuss movies find that some stick out as gems. This is not one. Since this movie came out, no one of dozens of people that are my friends have described it as the best movie ever. In terms of its rank on IMDb, is TSR overrated? YES! I went to about twenty other movie sites before I stopped looking and only found it on only one site within the top twenty. Just try it yourself. You won't even find it in the top fifty on most. Better than ""The Godfather"", no. Better than ""Citizen Kane"", maybe - (another overrated movie). Se7en is a more engaging movie in terms of relationships between people. Shawshank Redemption is like a vanilla R rated Disney movie, but enjoyable nonetheless. I don't dislike the movie. I just do not understand the complex and secret algorithms that IMDb uses. On some pages IMDb claims to explain its vote calculation methods to you and on others it says that it will never disclose its method of calculation completely. Maybe they have a system that works but is not perfect. It certainly does not coincide with the number of people that have seen a particular movie. Maybe the compensation for the fact that far fewer people have seen TSR than The Godfather is a factor.",8
"This movie is still on the top of the 250 . that's the only reason. you should watch it,except it's a great story and a great casting. the line ""REMEMBER HOPE IS GOOD THING"" really a touching line after all.. i just love the concept of it. in case you haven't watched the PRISON BREAK.this movie will make you fall in love with. all of the suspense in the movie was spectacular obviously. it's shows the friendship between the two people were definitely a bond of H2o unable to break. for the new viewer like me i didn't like the printing of the movie or maybe it's was my digital copy effect. but i think in 1994 the camera were not so good like today so. i will say that watching 2 hours were not wasted, it's all good and not boring too.",9
"Of all the movies I have ever seen in my lifetime, this ranks up there with the few and the proud of the most awesome movies you'd gladly watch over and over. It is truly a masterpiece. Pity it didn't beat Forrest Gump as picture of the year in 1994 (a good movie in its own merit) as Shawshank, to me, was much more of an enthralling film and deserving of the title.

One of the best choices in this film was to have Morgan Freeman (Red) as the narrator. Morgan has a voice and a way of telling a story that pulls you right into it. He does the same in the more recent film March Of The Penguins, which is also another good film.

Another good thing about Shawshank is that when you come to the ""stunning"" ending they don't just drop you right there, they still spend a good 15 - 20 minutes developing the end of the story. That's something I so wish wish they would do with more films nowadays.

If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption (based on the short story by Stephen King called Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption), what are you waiting for? ;)",10
"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",10
"A solid script that moves with sufficient pace to maintain engagement yet lingers on details without losing interest. This film uses narration in a way that almost becomes peripheral - you are focused on the drama yet the voice-over adds depth and explanation without distraction. An ultimately feel-good film that takes you though a gut- wrenching narrative. One of the few films that contains unwholesome language and content in a manner that seems 'natural' and not simply for effect (Billy Elliot is a classic example of such a film). No matter your favourite genre, if you haven't seen this then put aside any preconceptions and be prepared for thorough entertainment.",9
"Before watching this movie i was just postponing, its been a year or two after I really made up my mind to watch this movie, starting of this movie is really slow, at first any person who person who is a fan of movies like escape from Alcatraz and TV series like prison break you really gonna start questioning yourself that Andrey really gonna escape or not but keep your hope that its really going to be awesome. This movie is like filling a bucket with water drop by drop, so have some patience to watch this movie.

Moral of the story: ""Hope is a good may be the best thing & good thing never dies""",10
I bet Shawshank is playing on a station somewhere sometime at every hour of the day. That being said I can watch it every time I come across it.,8
"What can you say about Shawshank Redemption? There's a reason it has a 9.2/10 rating here on IMDb I guess. Indeed, this movie ties Forrest Gump on my #1 all-time-favorite list.

What would it feel like, to be thrown in prison for 30 years for something you didn't do? Anyone who thinks it couldn't happen is blind.

Many people might even commit suicide if it happened to them. Andy not only survived, but thrived in a world few could describe as anything but ""hell."" He became friends with a guy who really was actually guilty.

The other thing about this movie that was so awesome, was the great one-liners. ""Get busy livin, or get busy dyin."" The acting is spectacular; you ""feel"" like you're there in the prison, especially the first night he's there and the guy start's crying next to him. Wow, so painful to watch.

I read somewhere that in the book, Freeman's character was a red-headed Irish guy, and they thought it was funny to leave his name as Red in the movie. That's why he answers ""Because I'm Irish"" when Andy asks him why they call him Red.

This movie was simply amazing... and from Steven King no less! Crazy.

-Tracy Milburn",10
Amazing that a movie with this much misery can be about hope. Great performances throughout. Thomas Newman does a fantastic job with the soundtrack here as he does on American Beauty and Road to Perdition. Also he took cousin Randy's role in Finding Nemo.,10
"Can anything be said? surely one of the greatest films of all time, it has tremendous acting and some very sad moments in the film, throughout, the script is solid. The acting immense. WELL DONE TO ALL INVOLVED! Any comments email me- subject title SHAWSHANK.

Cheers.",1
"I'll always remember watching this film when i was younger, it was one of the first films that ever gave me that 'mind-blowing' experience you sometimes get when you've seen a brilliant movie. Tim Robbins gives what is undoubtedly for me his best performance as Andy, who is such an inspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in the early stages of the film. Morgan Freeman gave a stellar performance, arguably his best also, as Red, Andy's cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema.

This is a film i will never tire of, if you haven't watched it for whatever reason, you should do! A solid 10/10 for me! enjoy.",10
"I had heard this film was good and saw it sat at number 2 in the top 250 and appears in many all time great films top five list.You could say my

expectations were a little high.

This sort of thing can spoil a film,you expect a lot and it doesn't deliver,mainly due to the fact you listened to the word on the street and were let down.It Shawshanks case,however,this was NOT the case.

I have been putting off watching this film for years,don't know why, just one of those films I never got round to watching,what i didn't know was a 'classic','epic' was gathering dust on my shelf and i didn't know it.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb and not many films get me choked at the end,didn't quite get me but it was sure close!

This film is a feel good film,an unlikely one maybe and tinged with sadness but all the more reason to watch,i'll be watching it again I can assure you that.",10
One of the greatest stories ever made. I'm not much of a fan of King but this film adaptation is probably my favorite. Inspirational with good life lessons.,10
"When a movie makes you feel passionate and caring about murderers and thieves, you know you are watching a good one. The Shawshank Redemption may very likely be the best movie i have ever seen. Not only because of the mentioned fact, but because it has the every basics a good film needs. No movie making mistakes really are found through my eyes. This movie is rough, sad or even happy at moments. It makes you feel like you were there experiencing what the characters do. Superb acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabont's direction too. The Screenplay is not really by any way too predictable and from the first two minutes you know you are watching something special. I really can't of any movie that beats this one...",10
"Even though this movie is over 10 years old, the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever. The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless. This is also one movie that does not get old, and I have watched ""Shawshank"" many times. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances. They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. The one quote in the film that is a stand-out is, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"". Who would not feel the impact of that quote? This is one movie you have to have in your library, and I am not one that usually buys DVD's. This is a MUST SEE!!!! Don't miss this one, and also keep a box of tissues nearby.",10
"A truly fantastic film, very deserving of its spot at the top of the imdb rankings. A great story which is both incredibly dark and sad but also contains some some great feel good moments too.",10
This is the best movie I have ever seen. One should watch it if he/she is a movie enthusiast.,10
"Maybe the film is too old for my generation but I just found it boring, predictable, overrated and long.",10
"The way portrait of the characters on the screen was very good. even though the carried a little bit melancholy mood but at the ending of the film you 'll get a feeling of watching an excellent movie.I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",10
"Rate: 9.7/10 Rounded to 10

The Shawshank Redemption is easily the greatest movie of all time. Not many movies can compete with the greatness of this film. To start, the movie is based off a great book by a great writer. The Stephen King novel makes the perfect story for a movie. Next, the acting is great, it features two great actors: Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, who together form an amazing team. Finally, Frank Darabont did a great job directing this film. To sum it all up, this is a great movie. If you haven't seen it... WATCH IT! I bet you'll like it.

"Probably the best movie ever made. I've seen the Shawshank redemption maybe 20 times over the years and it still moves me each time. This is a timeless masterpiece where everything just comes together in to perfection -the score, the acting, the editing, the directing, the source material and adaptation. If you by some fluke should have missed this you have to allow yourself this amazing experience. This is a once in a lifetime movie where everything just comes together. With this and the green mile Frank Darabont made two of historys best pictures but this still take the first place in my book. Don't miss out on this one!",10
"This movie will give you everything!!! Every emotion you can possibly derive from a movie is here, and the ending.... brilliant!!",9
"Best there is and there will be.

""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living, or get busy dying.""",9
"It's a moving story, with a profound message that allows us to be aware of the injustices that are experienced in the penitentiary system, but also goes further, encompassing the development of human nature, of the struggle when one has the impression of that there is no hope, of the redemption of life after losing everything. As other comments have already said, it is a film that should be recommended as an antidepressant by therapists, and that everyone should see more than once in their lives.",10
"I don't know why I had selected the film on Hotstar, may be due to the look of Freeman on the thumbnail. But after completing the viewing there was a calm fulfilment of mind. The depth of the storyline, the conservative attitude of direction, the mesmerized background music, the excellence in lighting made the film so matured. Freeman was good as well and Gunton was superb. Thanks to the director.",10
"This is an excellent work. For a movie that doesn't have much drama, but has so realistic details, I was captivated. The performances are epic. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman has done one of the finest work of acting. The plot was not the most unique or unusual, but the work was Homeric, by that I mean it is monumental. This is one of those movies that will put you to think, that how patience can yield you fruits and how impatience and wrath can put you to jail. His anger made him do something (though he didn't do it) but he did act towards killing his wife, which lead him to jail. And later the patience was the only key for success, and he did manage to get away from that jail.by working hard for it. A must watch.",10
"Honestly, whenever you think of a good movie, what's the first thing that comes to mind when you think about it? Is it the story? The characters? The setting? How about the acting? The writing? Or, most importantly in some cases, the directing? Did the movie go in the direction that it needed to go?

Some, if not all people think of at least one of these things. Some think about it all, and judge the movie by how well it held up under all of these matters it had to worry about.

I'm one of the latter. And I think that not only is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" the greatest adaptation of a story ever, it quite possibly might be the greatest film, ever. And if it isn't, it's damn close.

Seriously, seeing that ""Shawshank"" is at #2 on the all time 250 is, at least to me, a testament to how under-rated and under-appreciated it really is. Now, don't get me wrong... being the second greatest film ever is quite an honor, and any film lucky enough to receive it must be pretty damn good anyway. But seeing it in second place just reminds me of the 1995 Academy awards. This movie was nominated for 7 awards, and do you know how many it went home with? 0. In a just world, it would have swept.

But I'm being a little too bias, so let's just get on with the movie, eh?

Anyways, the movie takes place in the late 1940's and is about a man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, in the absolute finest performance of his entire career) who, in the very beginning of the film, is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Of course, we know he isn't guilty, but either way, he's sent to live out two life sentences at Shawshank, one of the toughest prisons in the world. Meanwhile, Red (Morgan Freeman, also in his finest performance) is denied parole again, after serving 20 years of a life sentence.

It should be known to most of you that this movie is entirely based off of a 90 page short story by Stephen King called ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", which was featured in one of his collections. The book is entirely made up of Red's passages, which means that in the movie he's going to become the narrator. Normally, this would become intrusive, but here, it shines. It's also important to point out that there is an entire scene in the movie that was never in the book, where Andy rebels and plays music over the intercom for the entire prison to hear. This not only shows a powerful thing called ""hope"", it shows just how talented Frank Darabont really is. After all, he's responsible for another underrated gem ""The Green Mile"".

But back to the story. Andy arrives at the prison, and after a very crappy first night in which he didn't make a sound, he finally meets Red, and they become very good friends while he's there for 20 years. We see him struggle, get abused by the ""sisters"", build a library, do accounting because his life on the outside was that of an accountant and many other things. One of the most powerful scenes of the film is when he is put in the hole for 2 months because he snooped around too much with the warden (Bob Gunton, in his usual asshole role) about the person who really killed his wife.

Top that off with amazingly good co-star performances by William Atherton and Clancy Brown, and it can't be beat.

Anyways, yeah, I'm not saying anything else except that this is truly deserving of the best film honors here, and I'd like to see it.

An honest to god amazing film.",9
"awful. a dreadful disgrace. the film is the most cliched in cinematic history and is worthy of no respect. even worse is how it is so flawless yet it still is of no quality. i do not know how this film can be revered over others such as psycho, apocalypse now, raging bull, easy rider, the godfather, the killing fields, some like it hot and casablanca amongst others. shockingly horrendous",7
"This is a strategic, well performed movie, it has rhythm and is goodball the way through from start to end. Best movie i've seen for a long time!",8
Amazing movie no antic no vfx no actress but still a masterpiece best movie ever i dont know how many times i watched but every time i feel amazing,9
I watched this movie years ago and i watching now too. I think the most watched film in the world. maybe not the best but everyone has to watch.,10
"Okay, honestly, I don't think there's anything I can say about this movie that hasn't been said already, but I'll try anyway.

'Shawshank Redemption' is the greatest movie in history! The story is excellent and despite it's enormous runtime, the pacing is so good you don't even notice the time go by.

Everyone gives a wonderful performance, which combined with the writing makes each character feel so real.

How this film didn't bring home any Oscars is beyond me.",10
This is without a doubt the most well crafted movie I've ever seen. I wish I could wipe my memory and experience it the way I did on my first time watching.,10
"Great performance by all actors specaily by leading actor and support and excellent script, story and fantastic final scene that completed the story With real beauty. The photography was wonderful, and the smoothness of the scenes was also very wonderful. The amount of hope and feelings that make you cry and sympathize with the main characters of the film. All of them were incredibly welded from beginning to end. I did not find a single error in any scene in the movie. The photography was great and the direction is the greatest. It is considered one of the best films ever made Hollywood my rating 10/10.",9
"Loved this movie! Great story, amazing and remediable characters. The Plot keeps you guessing, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I watch it!

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give performances that will knock your socks off! There on screen friendship makes me weep for something as close and meaningful in everyday life. This is a movie to watch on a rainy day, with a big bucket of pop corn and a cold soda. As time goes on this movie will stand the test of time, it will be considered a classic, up their with greats like Brian's song, or the lethal weapons franchise.",10
I was 10yr old or something one fine night I was not getting the sleep my parents already went to sleep it's like destiny I changed so many tv channels to watch something I accidentally saw this movie running in our native local channel with our language dub. After I completed the believe me It changed my life even today lot of this imaginaries of this film I relate to.. red finding the box andy buried under the tree was something magical for me at that time I never knew this film was all time no1 in imdb I never knew how popular this film is but I don't even properly this films name for yrs..This movie no1 is always the hope I have for humanity.,10
"Absolutely fantastic film from start to finish, watched it to dress of times and still gets better every time i watch it",10
"Putting yourself mentally where no one can get to you mentally. Now that's something to pull off for ourselves in a daily life habit. The pressures in a prison are a great deal more concerning than a day to day grunge and nose to the grind stone. Timothy Robbins does amazing in his role in this Movie and the support of friend made of Morgan Freemans character, solid. It really had me pulled in from beginning to end. getting more review lines in can give me an opportunity to be chatty, sure. But sometimes a movie is just a must see. The less you say. The simplistic thought of conveying there is always something more found the second time around. There's much to catch. If it's on my watchlist I've seen it and will watch it over and over.That's a great way of putting it together in wording for me.",10
"I really don't even want to write this review because words can't describe the beauty that is The Shawshank Redemption. There are simply so many underlying philosophical themes embedded in this movie that do a masterful job of analyzing society, the concept of hope, the will of the human spirit, and the bond that can be created by two human beings. I didn't want this to be my favorite movie simply because it has the highest rating on this website. But, after taking the time to sit down and watch the whole thing I am 100% content with the fact that this has become my favorite movie, as of now... (5/13/17)",8
"The ultimate story of redemption - not as a judicial system defines it, but as a redemption of spirit. Really a beautiful film in every way, and one of the greatest of all time.",10
"Watched this movie for a first time with my father when I was a little kid. Since then I can watch this one every time when I have a chance to do so.

About honour, friendship, determination, rules.

Just love it!",10
Shawshank is one of the best prison movies other than green mile if you haven't seen it where have you been Morgan freeman at his best if you haven't seen it stop what you are doing and watch it...thank me later you wont be disappointed What you still reading this for... Go go go Still here huh,10
"Best movie I ever saw. It's a pinnacle in humankind's endeavor in film making and unbelievably without any special effects or fanfare. It's a story about normal human beings. Direction, screenplay and acting all are mind-boggling. Equally mind-boggling is how can this movie not get an Oscar even after considering that jury at Academy awards makes huge mistakes sometimes(remember ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""). In my mind I've no doubt that even if ""Avatar"", ""Titanic"", ""Return of the King"" and ""Ben Hur"" were all released in same year as this movie, the Oscars for best film, best direction, best actor and best supporting actor should all go to this movie. I've become a huge fan of Tim Robbins (he is brilliant in ""The Mystic River"" too) and Morgan Freeman. Also, let's not classify it as a prison movie since it's in a class of its own. It exhausts all superlatives. If you haven't watched it, watch it now. Who knows the world may end tomorrow :-).",9
Watch it again.. when you feel down or need an uplift. This movie shows how a movie can motivate others life.. it's the ultimate example that proves movie is the best and unperishable medium to perform literatures,9
"This film is perfection. Not because it is artistic, or a masterpiece, or even the most original film you'll ever see. It is perfect because of how it makes you feel. It is a story of hope & a story of friendship.

Other themes of resilience, overcoming & rising above oppression etc are all present as well. This is why it resonates with so many people.

If you view this film looking for editing & how shots are framed, you are entirely missing the point. Instead, listen to the story Morgan Freeman's beautiful voice is telling you. Watch how a man oppressed rises above. Watch how 2 men truly grow together in their friendship & quiet ways. Listen to the message of hope. Then wish you had never seen it, so you can go back & watch it for the first time all over again. It is something truly special.",10
Tied for the best movie I have ever seen...Unwatchable !!,10
One badass film realiy good if u not seen u need too,10
"An amazing plot with beautiful performances by actors of a different class. I strongly feel the music should have been more driven. This movie really deserved an iconic soundtrack. Nevertheless, everything else is exceptionally to-die-for stuff.",10
There is nothing that i can say that has not been said already. What can i say. It's one of the best movies ever made.,5
"You cant really critasis this film, it's a good all rounder and a hard hitting story line",9
"Great acting, magnificent story. Nothing more to be said",10
"This is without a doubt one of kings best movies and to be honest with there isn't much to be said except that you need to watch it to get why it is so good. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like dramas or slower movies, but other than that definitely give it a try. My only hope is that they don't give it a remake like the rest of king's films.",10
"This movie i watch many time, and every time I see it very motivated",10
"Felt like it was real , such a good acting and direction. Hatsoff for good story line script , acting , location and last but not least the direction.",10
Fascinating story of a banker who was wrongful imprisoned for the murder of his wife and befriends a fellow prisoner. Beautifully directed and masterful acting. I highly recommend Shawshank Redemption.,10
A very compelling movie. The acting is impeccable and the suspense is real. The plot was not predictable something that is unusual for a movie. All I have to say is that this is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!,10
I saw this movie and it is incredible. I like it very much.,10
"When ever anyone asks me what movies I've really enjoyed ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is at the top of my list.

Funnily though, it starts of with what almost seems like a 'B' movie murder, at least the way the initial scene and the acting unfolds. The first time I saw it I thought I was in for a disappointment but how wrong I was. It's a sweet ride all the way to the finish...and it's a long way to the finish. But anytime the story hints at dragging a bit (and it does on occasion) the plot shifts and goes off on a new tack.

The acting by all is superb. The story is great with a totally 'didn't see it coming' surprise leading to the conclusion, and you will empathize with Tim Robins in the lead role. Morgan Freeman is excellent as supporting actor and nicely ties it all together as the voice-over narration to gap the time intervals between different chronological scenes. After all, the story does span a period from the late 40s to the 70s. Yeah, it's somewhat of a sprawling epic but in a microcosm.

This is a truly great film, a classic now and for years to come. I can't believe that it lost the Oscar to ""Forrest Gump"".",10
"If I were asked what I should put at the beginning of the films I have watched so far, I would say 'the price of captivity'. However, I will make my grandchildren watch this movie. It would be my shame to ask them to be deprived of a movie like this when they were growing up.",10
This movie is one of those kind of movies that would move you on the power of bond and friendship. This movie tells to us that life with friends there to comfort you would make life worth all the pain and the obstacles. I was completely moved.,10

"too bad it came out in '94 with gump and fiction. deserved to win some awards. compelling flick based on a s. king short story that proves he is not a hack. (Check out Different Seasons which also has The Body (Stand By Me) and Apt Pupil. The movie follows the short story well with a few embellishments. Good casting, though i think tim robbins might have been an alternate choice. star quality deliveries by morgan freeman and bob gunton. in an era when we see much garbage find its way to the screen, swhawshank represents what movies should strive to achieve.",10
"Clever, precise, patience, purpose, friendship, loyalty, stealth, hope, hard work, system, extortion and so many things can be find, seen, heard, read there.",10
Most beautiful movie i have ever seen in my life i love morgan freeman and tim robins acting in this movie.,10
"""Friendship or Prison"" Film

I work in one of the last ""Mom & Pop"" Video stores in southern Florida. Without the restrictions of a Blockbuster-like corporation job expectentcies, I'm able to discuss anything I want with anyone - for however long it takes. A few months ago I had a customer inquire about the film; I knew right off the bat he had ""doubts"" about the quality of the film. I got it for him, and gave him a rundown of the plot when he asked me my ""No BS"" opinion on the film. I just wish this guy knew I don't lie to anybody about this film. We must have sat down for two hours: I just listened, subjectively, while he came up with some question or comment that a friend or relative had brought to his attention - giving him the impression the film was ""sketchy."" In the end, it simply turned out to be a question of whether or not it's a prison film or a friendship film. How do you weigh it? The setting is constant, but the characters are defined so well it's blinding. I only mention the incident with the customer since it made me realize which road the film really fits down best. ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" in the tradition of classic friendship characters such as R.P MacMurphy & Chief, Ratzo Rizzo & Joe Buck, Butch Cassidy & Sundance has its two main characters (Andy Dufrense & 'Red') as two guys tied into a friendship from *circumstance* (meaning prison). As the years pass and they can only see the world from a single point of view (behind the walls of Shawshank), they begin understand each other more and more on a spiritual level. Yes, it does start as a prison film, but eventually turns to a buddy/friendship film. With Andy and Red's friendship growing, the walls of Shawshank disappear - you can even notice there are almost no wide angle exterior shots after the first 45 minutes. The claustraphobia of the cells and the solitary cells are pretty harsh, yeah, but I take that as a metaphor for the restrictions the characters are unable to release; they're own ideas, beliefs and thoughts are also prisoners. I only discuss the conflict question of ""prison film or buddy film"" just to set something straight. The last time I saw the movie, I realized: ""Does anyone watching it remember they were prisoners? Does anyone *see* the walls of Shawshank?"" I think it was too difficult, with the Royal blue of the Gulf and the white powder of the beach, it's almost as if there's no trace of a dark, cold, and unfriendly prison anywhere in the film prior to that moment. Andy sees his friend, knowing exactly the reason for his arrival. After that, they know whatever lies ahead in life that could be challenging or difficult won't be anymore. It's a simple safety in numbers, ""you watch my back, I'll watch yours."" - very close to Joe Buck & Ratso from ""Midnight Cowboy.""

"For the longest time, since first seeing this movie in 1994, I never could place my finger on WHY it has remained one of my all-time favorites. At first, and most obvious, was that it was a Stephen King screenplay, as I love how Mr. King writes, not from the horror aspect but from the suspense aspect. This is a jail movie, and I have never really liked jail movies, they just never interested me. However, this film was much more than a jail movie. My growing interests in the visual and written arts, and continuing study thereof has made me consciously aware of WHY this is one of my all-time favorites.

The Shawshank Redemption, you can even speculate from its title,""Redemption"", that there is a struggle with humanity going on here. This film is largely based on the human condition, and the struggle for this man, Andy, to not lose his humanity in his incarceration.

Through a series of events, too much to elaborate on in this 1000 word limit by IMDB, Andy overcomes the emotional and physical barriers of his imprisonment to find his peace by means of a daring and well calculated in years of preparation, plan which puts the warden and certain guards in the hands of real justice finally. All these characters in this film, are so deep, that each one really deserves his own critical analysis. This is a must see movie, and not one you can watch once. You have to watch it several times to grasp what the writers have put forth. It is truly one of those films that comes along out of nowhere, and has a great impact but is not recognized for what it really is. As is all great art at the time, that illustrates the struggle of humanity and the human condition. Kudos to Stephen King for this gift.",10
"I was so surprised and glad to see this movie as high as it is on this site's list. It is one of my favorite movies and so many people missed out on it because of GUMP, which I personally feel is an inferior movie.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give incredibly moving and restrained performances that moved me to tears more than once. The direction and timing were flawless, and the story itself inspirational. It is so nice to see a Stephen King movie done right for once.

This is simply a wonderful movie, worth watching over and over again.",5
"A great movie in all categories, the best I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman have never played a role like this one. He is outstanding as Red. It is also the best movie Stephen King has ever been a part of. This is a must see.",10
"I run the risk of disappointing new viewers of this film by praising it as one of my all time favorites. One should view this movie with little preconception, and let it do its thing in its own time and way. People critique it for being slow paced, but time plays such an important part of this film--the pacing is hardly accidental. This is one of those films that is hard to fault for technique or failure to convey intent. About the only way you can object is if you don't agree with its outlook on life. I too, am surprised at how many of my friends and family list this as one of their top films--independent/prior to any cajoling on my part! I'm eagerly anticipating the DVD release of this film--I've purposely kept from watching my VHS copy any more so that I can experience the movie and its wonderful score all over again on DVD.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best film from a Stephen King story. The best by far. This film fits together so intricately and the end seems almost impossible. It's what everyone wants, of course, but it just doesn't seem possible. This movie could not be more perfectly cast, and the direction is impeccable. The story draws you in. This movie and ""The Green Mile"" are alike in the sense that they capture your attention for the entire film. These films are powerful and well-made. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" sits on another level. It is a film that will not grow old. It will stay fresh and fulfilling as the years go by. This is a must-see film. To go without seeing this movie is quite a loss. Do yourself a favor and see this quality flick!",10
"Hope. The central message of ""hope"" in this movie is so strong and universal, it's hard for anyone not to appreciate it. One of those movies that when it's on, you have to finish watching it. If you only watch one movie this lifetime, make it this one. :)",10
This film truly captivates the way hope can set anyone free from their obstacles. I truly enjoyed this movie. It is most probably the greatest film there is.,7
"What amazes me about the Shawshank Redemption is that I can watch it over and over again without losing interest. Normally for me, even with movies I enjoy, once is enough. However, when I'm channel surfing and I flip across Shawshank, I almost always leave it on and watch it to the end.",10
"What can I say? It is well worth the viewing. Breathtaking. >Leaves you in awe. You laugh and cry, and feel glad to be alive >after this movie is through with you. One to own and watch over >and over. I highly recommend",10
This film combines great acting and intense plot to form a truly powerful movie. I does not matter what genre you like this film will make you feel for the characters. The best Stephen King movie by far. When watching the film to really get into it watch it without your friends around.,10
"What can you say about a movie that is perfect? I myself have plenty to say. I believe The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made because it towers above other films in all respects, directorial ability, acting ability, the story, everything. Director Frank Darabont captured the essence of the hopelessness (or supposed hopelessness) of a dark and desolate prison.

Morgan Freeman shines in a supporting role, and Tim Robbins sets the standards for everything a lead actor should be. His performance was so good, so heartfelt, that every time I see the film I feel like I'm the one fighting his battle. The entire theme of the film, hope, is so overwhelmingly powerful. Based on Stephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the idea of finding hope in a world where life itself is gone is beyond the realms of emotion, it can't be said with words the impact this film makes. Everyone gets what they deserve in the end, and the glorification of triumph and the conquering of fears go beyond imaginable. As a young lady at 16, I have much trouble sometimes finding something to hold onto since falling into a monotonous routine. This film reminds me of the good things in life and that every day is a new one, and is something to be cherished. Thank God that in a world of shoot-em-up, sex and drug filled, ridiculous films some people still see the true meaning of movie making, to change the lives of those watching. If you have never seen The Shawshank Redemption, please do. It is a film of such epic proportions that it moves your soul.",10
"I can't figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept like that!Its just beneath all the beautiful thing.Thanks to Frank Drabount,Morgan Freeman,Time Robbins.Excellency is sky high in this film.Not a movie,its just a lifetime experience.Sometimes people felt to sad ,they curse themselves,regret for everything they have done in life.They crush for success,run after money.But,here is the thing that changes everything and it is indeed ""The Hope"".No matter how bad you feel,no matter how hard the path of the life is,the show is still goes on if you have just one thing and that is ""The Hope"".Life would certainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully executed movie.Probably It will help many people to start their life for the second time!!Hats off to everyone who worked with the Shawshank Redemption Team..",5
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There is so much to this story and if you blink once you'll miss something. Behind every color and object there lies a message. Watching this movie only once is an injustice. It is a great movie and I highly recommend it.,10
"This must be one of the movies I have enjoyed most at the cinema. I can't find one bad moment in this masterpiece. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman delivered their parts as if they were living them. Morgan Freeman's thought's was interesting listening too. My feeling for this film can't be expressed in words so I let the rest of the audience decide whether they like it or not. But as You already imagine, this is one of my favorites.

10 out of 10

A must see......................",10
"I have just finished watching this movie for about the sixth time and I still feel the inspiration of hope in my heart from the movie's glorious ending. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and yes this is my favourite movie. I'm sure there's others which tie in my taste for best picture I just can't bring them to mind right now. (Actually, come to think of it The Breakfast Club ranks pretty high up there as well.)I just wanted to say that this movie is very well done all the way from the acting, the storyline, to the musical track it wins on all three fronts for me. And I also wanted to say that it may have been robbed at the Oscars or almost passed through unrecognized by the public in its theatrical release, or may have even made not that much money it seems to have been redeemed itself on the IMDB with a well deserved #2 ranking among the favourites IMDB voters voted for. A must see.",10
One of the most beautiful movies I ever seen. Everyone has to see it.,6
"At the risk of gushing... I just have to comment that this film takes my breath away every time I watch it. I can never seem to pass by the channel when it's on TV. I cry every time I see it. It's a good cry though, a ""feeling something"" cry. Sometimes in the rush of daily life you can forget what it's like to simply FEEL your emotions. As other people have said here - each time you watch this film, more layers of story are revealed to you. The whole experience of it -- the music, the atmospheric, this-feels-like-a-real-place setting, the poetic quality of Morgan Freeman's narration (and what a voice he has!), the characters who seem like real people instead of stereotypes, and the theme of the survival of hope even in the most oppressive of circumstances -- is very spiritual. I experience the gamut of emotions during this film but wind up feeling inspired and uplifted. I feel as though I've taken the journey beside Andy and Red. This movie does indeed stay with you; you find yourself pondering its elements and marvelling at its beautiful simplicity. It's a movie that requires you to pay close attention and I certainly agree that more than one viewing is necessary to appreciate everything it wants to offer to the viewer. What a treasure this movie is. May it be preserved well!!!! I hope... I hope...",10
"This film is, with no shadow of a doubt what so ever, the best movie that I have ever had the wonderous pleasure to view. Films like Shawshank are what allow me to love movies and to cherish wonderful stories. I can say that I'm a critical gremlin- I'm constantly attempting to find faults, flaws and plot holes in every movie i see- yes, I'm that guy who always says it was only an ok movie when you loved it- But... this one is so powerful, so beautiful, so absolutely inspiring that I couldn't care if there was a plot hole or a flaw, its just too good of a film to attack. To Hell with Forest Gump for winning over Shawshank, to Hell with Titanic, Shakespeare in garbage, The English Idiot, and Forest Dump- these movies all sucked, sucked, sucked to begin with but compared to the diamond jewel of Shawshank, they look as good as sitcoms made by Fox. So anyway, my favorite movie of all time and only one of three movies worthy of a ten rating.",10
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is an accountant who, accused of murdering his wife, entered Shawshank prison in 1947. Dufresne, just like everybody else, claims he is innocent. Only in his case, it's actually true. Pretty soon his stoic manner gets the attention of narrator Redding (Morgan Freeman). Redding is the local smuggler. He admires Andy's positive attitude. Even the tough regime of Shawshank prison can't break him.

The life in Shawshank prison is presented as metaphor for our real society. Wherein the ""prisoners of life"" accept their fate and stop dreaming to avoid being disappointed. Offcourse there's always one who is determined to break through.

The Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope, friendship and surviving within the walls of a heavily guarded prison. This movie is a shiny jewel. It tastes like the freedom of a silver-blue bird a summer day. Like strolling around the prison yard as if you could just leave for a cocktail party at any moment. Freedom after twenty years of confinement. The Shawshank Redemption colors the darkest mood sky-blue. The color of the sea. The color of Andy's freedom.",8
"Coming into this film you really don't think that you will see a movie of this high caliber. I think I have seen this movie over 30 times in my time on this planet and i look forward to viewing it many more times. This is a drama which follows Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) as he has to serve a lengthy jail sentence for the murder of his wife. Although he claims he is innocent the overwhelming evidence lands him in the Shawshank Prison. At first sight he is seen as ""The tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass"" and is doubted from the start. He keeps to himself for the most part until he meets Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and creates and special friendship with him. This story line creates one of the most moving films of not even the 90's but dare I say of all time. This is my favorite movie and will always be my favorite movie and I think that the performances by the whole cast (mostly Robbins and Freeman) deserve critical acclaim for their portrayal of two people just trying to make it in life. The musical score of this film is also astounding and excellent by Thomas Newman one of the most working film composers out there. The Director (Frank Darabont) directors one of his prison dramas and most likely his best. This film is emotional, intense, uplifting and should be seen by everyone. I give this film a 10/10, 4 stars, thumbs up and everything along those lines, please for the good of humanity see this movie laugh, cry and get busy living.",10
"The Shawshank redemption is one of a very few movies that lives up to the book it is based upon. Many Stephen King books become almost unrecognizable on the screen, but this one, like 'The Green Mile', stays true to the feel and rhythm of the book. Every time I watch it, I appreciate it more. One of the best.",10
This film is destined to become a true classic. This masterpiece of filmmaking is worthy of its place on the Top 250 and should be #1. The film gives time to its characters and time to the story unlike other films. We see the world through the characters and feel as they do. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give outstanding performances well worthy of an Academy Award. The ending is the greatest of any film and is so because of the time given to the characters and story. The score captivates the feeling of the film and gives the feel of Andy and Red's true redemption. This is a must have in any collection and deserves all the allure it has been given.,10
"I'll save everyone from having to read the same list of superlatives that are in 99% of these comments, and just agree that it is literally the best movie ever made.

My comments will be about my theory that Andy Dufresne was intentionally developed as a Christ figure in the movie. I never actually read the short story, so I don't know if that was Stephen King's intention, but I do believe that that is what the film-makers had in mind. Andy Dufrense (initials A.D.) gave many speeches that sounded like sermons. He spoke of never losing faith, no matter how bad it was in prison. He wanted his friends to believe there was a better place waiting for them (Mexico). He performed miracles providing them with beverages on the rooftop. By the end the warden saw Andy as a threat to his power if nothing else through sheer charisma. Andy escaped the prison and contacted his friends still in prison through a letter, giving them all hope. When he escaped, he raised his arms into a definite crucifix-like position (in the rain storm).

Maybe I'm just stating the obvious (I mean ""Redemption"" is in the title!), or maybe I'm completely off base, but I am suprised I haven't seen this movie discussed in a more religious way (other than having such a religious following). I'm not really a church-goer for my own reasons, but I found watching this movie to be a wholly spiritual experience. I don't know what my favorite movie is, but whatever it is, it's no Shawshank...",10
"This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.

Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.

The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.

If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.",10
"Anyone who has seen this film will understand why I cannot justify with words.

Anyone who has not seen it; I feel sorry for you.

10/10",9
"A movie about life, about freedom and about friendship. This movie is just perfect. I've seen it a lot of times and I just can't get enough of it. Each time i see it, i learn something else. This movie gives you a different meaning about freedom. Great performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and perfectly directed too.",10
"Its one of those movies that teaches the appreciation of life. The movie is masterfully crafted with an incredible story line. Every dialogue is deep, hard hitting and intriguing. There is not one forgettable character in this movie and it is a pleasure to watch how their stories develop and intertwine with the protagonist.",8
I give it an 8 but it shouldn't be in the first position! This is Fight Club's spot...,10
"I rented the Shawshank Redemption after reading many of the comments on this very page, and I have to agree: this movie is absolutely brilliant: great acting, great direction, great writing, and one of the most moving story lines ever. I give it a 20 out of 10.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. giving 8/10",10
"If anyone has any doubts about how great this movie is...just look at the number of votes, the average of them, and read all the user comments. It was a crime not to award this movie the Oscar in 1994. I have used the IMDB for two years...at least...and Shawshank is consistently in the top three; the only exceptions being when one of those over-advertised ""hype"" movies is fresh in the box office. To anyone who has not witnessed near perfection in movie-making, just rent this movie and think about how you feel as the credits start to roll at the end. I'd go out on a limb to say that anyone who isn't moved emotionally to a higher level after seeing this movie is probably a robot.

In my opinion, it's not the number one movie of all time (please see Holy Grail) but it is a very close second! And, I believe the AFI should pay attention and make this movie its first amendment to the top 100 of all time.",10
"So yeah this is probably the best movie ive ever seen in my life. Its brilliantly shot(roger deacons of course) magnificently scored, perfectly acted by the entire cast,heart warming,heart breaking and uplifting in equal measure. Its a classic for a damn good reason and I hope it gets a 4k release for its 25th aniversery.",10
I have absolutely no flaws with this movie in any way,10
"What can I say that hasn't already been said before? Probably no much, so i'll repeat what almost everyone else on the planet has said before. This movie is fantastic. If you haven't seen it and you get the chance to, watch it.",9
"Superb adaptation of Stephen King's story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. It is very true to the story, with all its mood, plot twists and the bad guy you love to hate. Characterization is magnificent. I am not normally a Tim Robbins fan, but he does a near perfect job here. Very satisfying. Worth seeing many times. The scene with the music from the Marriage of Figaro is my favorite. The relationship between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's characters grows into one of the most satisfying in fiction. As all great fiction does, this story and the movie of it make you question what is real, what is true, and what is important.",9
"I'm sure in the 6,825 reviews there are currently for The Shawshank Redemption, anything that I was planning on saying would have already been said and more eloquently than I would.

If you haven't seen this film, just watch it and thank everybody later. It has a rating of 9+ for a reason.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best classic movies of all the time. No wonder it got many nominations. I think everything about this movie is pure gold starting with the story because is a movie that makes you feel all the emotions; touches the soul like no other, we go to an experience that lasts 30, 40, 50 years .. men imprisoned, physically, morally and sentimentally deprived of the most basic things, the long is cruel and central, he touches and shocks, talks to the viewer through the most felt privations of detainees, the story is very complex and keeps you interested from beginning to end. This movie is really a jewel and I strongly believe that is a candidate that can't be missed in the list of films you should definitely watch before you die.",9
"Why do I think this movie so good? Because I find myself thinking about it year after year, and I get more out of it each of the three times I've seen it. It works on several different levels. First, the surface level, the plot and it's surprising twists the first time I saw it. On a second level, are the themes of hope for Red and Andy, of how Red finally finds hope, of how Andy secretly creates his own hope and escapes.

On a deeper level, the movie is an allegoric tale for all human lives. We are all imprisoned for crimes we didn't commit, namely the prison of life with it's ultimate death sentence for all of us. We all would love to be redeemed from death, whether we are religious or spiritual, or not. > I can think of no other movie that satisfies on these different levels. I see other comments here at IMDb about how other movies have better cinematography, better directing, better acting, or comparing it to Cool Hand Luke or other prison movies. Those comments miss the mark completely because they are about the task of film making or superficial comparisons of plot devices.

To me, great movies, like great literature, touch people's lives, change our view of the world, make us think about our place in the world. Does the Godfather hit that mark? Star Wars? Cuckoo's Nest? No Way! Even Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, as wonderful as those movies are, don't hit the level of universal truth that Shawshank does, and does again, and again and again.",10
"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.",10
Good one. Lot of things happening in the story . But simple . Good acting . good ending . I watched in 2020,9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film about the power of hope. Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is one of those rare characters in American cinema that inspires one to live with conviction, tenacity, and poetry. The relationship between he and Red (Morgan Freeman) echoes the deep friendship found in the Biblical story of Jonathan and David. Truly a film to watch again and again. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""",10
"This movie was really well done 100% through. It is one of those films that is a classic because it is a powerful story, but it's also an intelligent film. We don't see that too much, and I hope to see more films like this! It makes me think of the essence of filmmaking and storytelling, and how much that aspect of our industry is really honored. Every Director wants to tell a great story, but few let the story tell itself. This is an intelligent film because it gets so involved with our character driven plot lines that you forget you're watching a movie at all. As a young filmmaker, this film is a fantastic model to build a foundation around. Let's just hope studio thoughts don't pick up and they try to make a sequel/prequel...",8
"Well, Shawshank Redemption is a perfect movie. There is no scene out of place, no piece of music that stands out, the moral is very clear, and it doesn't even need to be spelt out for you. The acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman complete the movie and make it the heart-warmer, the tear jerker, the nail biter, and the perfect movie that it is. After I saw it for the first time, I was instantly touched and a fan for life. I've only seen it three or four more times, but each time I see it, I learn something new, or discover a new angle of the story. I'd say that if you only see one movie for the rest of your life, it would have to be Shawshank Redemption. And if, after watching it, you can tell me that it isn't the best movie in the world, then I'd say that there is something seriously wrong with you.",10
"One of my favorite all time movies!

I've watched it at least 12 times and enjoy it as much each time I see it. One of the best adaptations and truest to the original Stephen King stories that I have seen. The other being ""The Green Mile"".

The combination of musical score with the well written and delivered lines of Morgan Freemans narration still can well the tears up in my eyes. His narration and acting in this film surely should have garnered him an Academy Award! He's an American Icon in my book. Superbly written, superbly directly, superbly filmed, and superbly acted.

You'll never be disappointed to have this DVD in your collection.",9
"This is one of the best movies I've seen. I was never bored, or lost interest, even though it's not an action movie. I'd recommend it for anyone. Proof that Stephen King doesn't just write horror.",9
"It's one of the best movies I've ever seen! if you haven't seen it, you're living for no reason!",9
"Now, I am more than willing to admit this film's good points. Yes, it was well crafted from everything to costumes to writing to cinematography to historical research. Yes, it was an inspiring film and one of the few good screen adaptions of Stephen King's works. And yes, it was well acted and is one of the few movies released this decade that I could watch with my parents without being embarrassed.

But to be considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Really? It was definitely a good movie, but I just can't see it as one of the All Time Greats. If you want to talk about all those good points, then where is ""Stand by Me""? I would be much more likely to vote for it, but it still shouldn't clear the top 10!!

While I can't think of anything that was bad about it, I just don't beleave that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has what it takes to be considered a classic. It didn't really touch on any new ideas or delve deep into any volatile emotions. And while it did give you something to think about at the end of the movie, it is not something stays with me like so many other truly classic movies do.

Despite my misgivings on it's placement in movie history, I would still recommend it to anyone who asked about it. But no one has ever asked, and I never really think of it. It was good, it just wasn't all that memorable.",10
"Thank god I am alive to watch this movie.I really appreciates the director of this movie.

This movie is a true masterpiece.",9
"This film was very inspirational and spiritual and I really enjoyed it. It truly demonstrated how difficult life was back then. It was well written and well produced. The acting that was demonstrated was tremendous. I truly enjoyed watching this film. The film Shawshank Redemption conveys to the audience the image of hope in the worst possible situation. Through the themes and the cinematic decisions applied in these two episodes the director has made these vital to the understanding of the movie. He has given two examples of the extreme situations to which prisoners go depending on their emotions. One of the emotions is yet one of the main themes of the movie, hope, and in my opinion it has been brought up extremely effectively.",8
I have entirely watched this movie twice. The first time was at my age of 19. I stayed up for watching it because the plot is super attractive. The second time is just now. A great movie is worth seeing again and again.,9
Best Drama movie i have ever seen. You must watch this movie before dead,10
"I remember when my younger brother got this out for us too watch, he praised it and encouraged me to watch it too. I remember thinking that it was going to be rubbish but I had a spare afternoon so we did. I was wrong lol. This is literally the perfect movie. I've watched it many times since my first time and still love it. The timeline is fluid and relevant all through Andy and Reds journey. Morgan freeman narrates perfectly as always. The plot and sub plot are truly magnificent. The score is excellent and the ending on the beach is tear jerking and just broils with happiness. This is a story of an unlikely friendship that works beyond the scope of the expected within the walls of a place that would typically make it hard to have a bond with any other person. Perfection!",10
i cannot believe someone would call this movie great i would give it a 3 but the fact it is the highest rating movie ever on this site makes me go crazy how pathetic can this be this is the most overrated movie ever created made with a low budget it seems all that happens is a guy that went to prison gets raped several times escapes and meets his friend from prison back when he was out ending 99% of the movie was made in prison where all that happened was he gets raped and washes some clothes seriously how can you even compare this near to godfather dark knight etc? ...and the bad director just killed himself at the end his wife gets killed he isn't even sad about it 20 years in prison has some money not that much and is happy how nice,10
"One of the best movies I've seen, and one of only a few I am willing to watch more than once. The kids have even watched it more than me. The pacing is slow but constant and the tone it sets pulls you in from the start.",10
"Numerous times I have watched this movie and never found a single fault anywhere. the cinematography is just perfect, music in the different scene just takes you somewhere else. That narration of morgan freeman is just out of the world. Most of all the story is just masterpiece. You can never guess the ending. the story just keeps you attached. I would say this movie has the best music of all time. No other movie matches it in terms of music, also in terms of some other category also. You feel inspired. there is an urge which remains after watching to know what happened next. still you feel satisfied after watching. So many wonderful dialogues you just want to memorize and remember always. you feel like remembering these dialogues can change your life. they actually literally can do it. that is my opinion. It is not like I have just watched a few movie and like this one because I have not watched many good movies. I have watched hundreds of movies. Yet this is in my all time top 5 list.. I wont say This movie is my favourite. Because I have other favourite movies also. But this one has such charm that I watch it again and again. Just try it. then see for yourself. Dont pass on the change to experience something this wonderful",10
"This movie is perfection. One of the best movies ever made, in my opinion.",10
"I love it, i do always love and watch to see movies on 70's to 90;. To me those was the gold time for cultured. I want to see more . Best Film.",9
Brilliant movie! Absolutely amazing. The ending is very emotional.,10
"The story as a whole is incredibly done, everything from the camera work to the choice of words used. I also love how each character is so unique and well developed. So many small adjustments are made throughout the film, to the characters make up for example, which makes this such a well finished film. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. (side note, this is my only 10/10 film)

It is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. I feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made, and i have many good reasons to think this.

-Sean",10
I was deeply impressed by this film. Nothing can stop us from chasing what we want.,10
"I watched it when I was very young,and I did not see much of the significance of the film.I just thought Andy was awesome! Persistence is victory ,this move should have a lot of meaning.I am going to watch it again.",9
"Andy : There are places in the world that aren't made out of stones .There is something inside that they can't get to ,that they can't touch . Spiritual freedom, then nothing can hold you back. Read more books, go out more, knowledge is very important.",10
Why rating this movie a 1/10 or up till 5/10? I don't get it people. Maybe this isn't one of your favorites but why rating it so low?,10
"When I saw this movie on the top 250 movies of all time list (it appeared as #2) I thought I was in for one of the best movies ever made. Yes, it was an interesting story, but it seemed much too unrealistic to be among the top 10. I mean sure, The Sixth Sense, one of my favorite movies, is unrealistic, but we realize that going into the movie. It doesn't play itself off as a real movie about real friendships.

The movie was worth seeing, but the way everything fell into place was really disturbing for me. That's not real life. I give the movie a 7 out of 10, in that, it was a good movie, but it certainly wasn't the best.",10
This movie is love to me after watching this movie i am so satisfied this movie deserved the no 1 movie of imdb.,10
"I'm sorry I don't mean to offend people who like this film but what on earth is all the fuss about over this film it is nothing compared to The Godfather and yet people vote it as second to the number 1!? The Shawshank Redemption has a relatively simple plot ,dull camera work the script is full of soppy language (thanks to the overrated Steven King)that just isn't particularly clever in any way.The atmosphere of 'prison' is totally unrealistic all the characters are wimps.The only good element is Morgan Freeman because he's a good actor.There aren't any clever twists-for instance the 'mystery' of what is in the box at the end of the film is really unoriginal. Please feel free to argue with me over this but come on people step back and look at the film what is it made up of? Then look at The Godfather look at what that is made up of - Brill cast, excellent plot, damn good script, good directing and camera work everything is perfect then look back at the Shawshank redemption its just at a completely different level. Its quite ridiculous really.",10
One of the best movies of all time. A lot can be learnt from Andy. The character of Abdy shows how patience & will power helps to overcome all the odds.,10
"There are hundreds of masterfully crafted films out there but this is my favorite film and I am glad it is still no. 1 on the IMDB ranking. Powerful and moving, deep and true.",9
"Oh Lord I Must confess, as I have sinned!

I have just watched the movie for the first time and must say it's a True MASTERPIECE!

With its open and difficult but still so realistic conversations as well as the masterful performances by the actors, I must say I understand why it's the top rated movie on IMDb.

You feel the exact emotions the movie wants you to feel from the weird feeling of liking of a condemned murderer up until the end where i must say the movie got a tear from me, what is quite unusual for me.

This movie gets you and is already on my list of my all time favorites, as I continue to think about everything happening in the movie over all this time and how those characters developed an amazing synergy that makes you as the viewer constantly hope for them, feel the pain for their dying comrades and be happy when they have a nice moment.

Over all I must say it's a perfect movie, that I would have to watch quit a lot more to find mistakes and only if I were really looking for some, but since I hate looking for something wrong I like to focus on the good things and this movie has an uncountable amount of these.

-> 10/10 Perfektion!!!",9
"There is nothing I would change. Everything was just right and when I finished watching I found it hard to write a review about it.

Honestly, one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, mainly because there is nothing extraordinary about it. It is some sort of a common story and yet it is still pretty well performed and developed.

It is kind of a long movie (2h22min) and everything happens slowly but still gets the attention mostly because you want to know what happens next and how the character will turn out.

The thing is you get really invested on the dialogues and how is the life of a prisioner who is charged a life sentence. I think it really puts things in perspective.

As I said, I wouldn't change a thing. Amazing.",10
One of the best movie I've watched. Best Narration ever! This movie had inspired me so much and loved it.,7
"It's a good story, nice acting and plot, but it deserves a 9/10.",10
"Best film of all time. Not even close. If you haven't seen it (what have you been doing?) go and see it! If you have seen it, go and watch it again! Cinema perfection.",10
"An amazing film that that always surprises you. One of the top movies of all time, awesome acting and a serious and controverted plot.",10
"Oh my, it's fantastic film. Greatest film for all time.",10
"One of my favorite films, I saw it awhile ago, and this film holds special magic that took away the day I watched it any bad feeling or anything I felt about that day. Story about humankind above all, and friendships, and the power of people believing in you, in a yet real way and not too cheesy way, that leaves you with a great taste in the mouth, and charisma of the two characters is excellent. The plot seemed a little far fetched first, but again, character development and power of human behavior is what makes this film so great. THere's something that strikes you to the emotion, and some simplicity in the film as well, that the moral and theme is, enjoy life, and don't forget those that are dear for you.",9
"To most this is jail break movie, to others it's about friendship, yet some swear by how it is about standing up against authority.

See, the thing with great movies is that they're always about simple things. This movie was about life - about the mistakes you make - about the price you might have to pay - about the irony in it - and of course, about redemption. There is not a single moment in the movie when you feel the crew has lost their grip on the script.

What I enjoyed the most was Morgan Freeman's soliloquies. The dialogues a quoteworthy and are etched long after the movie ends.

This is one of those movies you never get tired of watching.",10
I'm not going to spoil anything here but I'll just say that this movie was perfect. I must say it lives up to its acclaim and is one of those good examples of corruption.,10
"One day living an ordinary life, the other defenceless brawl for survival spiced with stirring, touching and personal shots one would mind experiencing first-hand.",10
"Before I saw the movie I knew this was number 1 on imdb. So I knew what to expect. It could be overrated or it could be the best movie I have ever seen. And yes it's maybe the best movie i've ever seen.

The movie tells a great story about life in prison. Frank Darabont created his masterpiece here. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave a fantastic performance. The craftsmanship of the movie is simply brilliant. There are also a lot of great supporting characters here that i could never forget. Since the movie only takes place in one place, you feel completely comfortable in this beautiful atmosphere. The movie is very focused on the well-written characters. I love seeing you get to know each and every character and spend time with them. It's fun to empathize with the characters and watch the bets on who survives the first night or how they play cards, have lunch or play baseball outside and even the scenes where they work or sleep are awesome. The characters are the heart of this amazing movie. It's a lot about what it's like to live in prison and how hard it was back then. What it's like when you've spent your whole life in one place and go through the same process every day. But what the movie really shows behind this dangerous prison is the friendship. The basic message here is friendship. That friends are so important and that they are always there for you.

The movie is also the best of 1994. Better than The Lion King and also better than Pulp Fiction. If you ask me if The Shawshank Redemption is better than The Godfather, i'd say at least as good, but not necessarily better. Maybe better, but The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption are among the best movies of all time.

Also, the movie has such a satisfying ending. And you just don't want it to stop. I would never turn the movie off again. It is a journey into an adventure that everyone should see. Overall a masterpiece by the mastermind Frank Darabont. This is a piece of art. That's what movie is.",9
"Will keep it short, possibly the best movie made. an absolute gem",9
"Although the shawshank redemption was an amazing movie which excelled in almost every category, I cant help but notice it was heavily inspired by other prison movies such as escape from Alcatraz. Regardless of that the plot was pretty predictable as to how Andy was going to escape and there is no factor that makes it one of the best of movies of all time. I love how the movie ended on a high note but overall it's a 7/10.",9
Watched it a couple a months back for the first time. This film truly has great storytelling through its messages and emotions. Freeman puts in one hell of a performance as well.,10
"This is the greatest movie of all time! I'm not joking! The Godfather is good, but this movie is beyond any other movie!Each and every movie ever made has to bow down to this amazing, moving, grasping and beautiful movie! It's story is greater than Forrest Gump, it's actors are greater than Marlon Brando and Al Pacino and Casablanca, it's story is greater than Star Wars(Of course the old ones!)! This is the movie should have one higher number when you vote, because it's greater than a 10, even an 11. It's the most touching story in the story of the movie industry. If you haven't seen this one, you have no idea of what you are missing! This is not a must see picture, this is the most see picture! You'll never regret watching this movie, never!

Movies can hold you prisoner. But only ""The Shawshank Redemption"" can set you free. Only Shawshank Redemption, forever!",10
"I would like to review this film in a Director of Photography's view, so if you are not interested in filmmaking, you better back off here. The camera movements are phenomenal and unexpected. Amazing cinematography here. Let me not touch about the story.",10
"I always knew the film existed but i never got to watch it, so on a rainy thursday night I decided to give it a go. It was one of the best decisions in my life. Through the whole film you see brilliant execution of setup and payoff. Without telling to much the film always shows you minor details or some sort of activity, that will be executed later in some payoff that really gives you a warm-hearted feeling or makes you chuckle. The film also provides brilliant acting throughout the movie and you get emotionally close even to the side characters if you will see. Overall the film and its theme show a really good continuation of your character once you are in prison and how it changes you.

Thanks (btw my first review)",10
"You know what would have made this movie a whole lot better?

It's if at the end, when Red (Morgan Freeman) made his final long,

windy speech to the parole board, he had been rejected once

again, and the movie ended right there? Maybe then I'd consider

the average rating (9.0) and rank (#2) on the IMDb top 250 list to be

well deserved.",10
"First of all you need to be prepared for this 3 hour long movie(though the movie worths it).Morgan freeman's background voice will keep you with the story.Dialogues were well executed.The strongest part was it's narration which makes it the best.I wouldn't have watched this if it wasn't on the top of IMDb list.At some point of time i felt the movie is just dragging on the story.Still at the end you won't mind it.

The movie also carries the message of friendship,hope,will and brilliance of our protagonist.Sometimes i felt pity on him and sometimes i couldn't stop myself praising his brilliance.

I think this movie will keep impressing generations ahead,no matter how much advance human becomes.",1
"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys.

It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",10
"First of all, I think that this movie was awesome. I really enjoyed it and almost every sentence in it could have been a quote of a mastermind. The movie was just so great.",10
This is not one of my favorite movies or something but it is one of the best movies i ever saw. The writing is so good and the actors are superb. 10/10 for sure.,9
"Based on novel by Stephen King, Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongly convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary.

The film explores themes of hope, friendship, and the struggle for redemption. Tim Robbins delivers a captivating performance as Dufresne, a man who retains his dignity and sense of humanity despite the dehumanizing conditions of prison life. Morgan Freeman is also outstanding as Red, a fellow inmate who becomes Dufresne's friend and confidant.

The film is expertly crafted, with great attention paid to the details of prison life and the development of the characters. The script is well-written, with moments of humor, drama, and suspense woven together in a satisfying and emotionally resonant way.

What makes ""The Shawshank Redemption"" truly special is its ability to leave a lasting impact on its audience. The film's message of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity is both uplifting and inspiring, and it resonates with viewers long after the credits have rolled.

Overall, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece that deserves its place among the greatest films of all time. It is a testament to the power of storytelling and a reminder that, even in the darkest of circumstances, there is always hope.",10

It's a film that will make you laugh, cry and will keep you hooked until the end. It's a film that will leave you feeling uplifted and inspired.",10
"This film is the best one-off ever made. From watching the Green Mile and from what I heard about the Majestic, it seems that Frank Darabont will never make a movie as good as this again. It is emotional, ambitious, and breathtaking in equal measure. The last 30 minutes are the best on celluloid.",10
"Too bad about Tim Robbins' politics, because this is one of the best movies ever made. I never get tired of it. Plot is tightly woven and everything fits together. I particularly enjoy Morgan Freeman, but there are no weak players. This movie deserves to be at the top of the list.",10
"This is the one and only film that even though it is over two hours, I wanted to watch it again, the second it finished. No other film has ever bought up such emotions from me. I will stand by this as The Greatest Film of all time proudly.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic movie that tells a powerful story. It's about a man named Andy who ends up in prison for a crime he didn't commit. In this tough place, he befriends a guy named Red. What's special about this movie is that it's not just about prison life; it's about friendship and the enduring spirit of hope.

The acting is brilliant. Tim Robbins, who plays Andy, and Morgan Freeman, who plays Red, give performances that will stay with you. You'll feel like you're right there with them, going through their ups and downs.

The movie shows us that even in the worst circumstances, people can find hope and redemption. It's a reminder that no matter how bad things may seem, there's always a chance for a better future. The story, the characters, and the message make Shawshank Redemption a must-see. So, if you haven't watched it yet, give it a try, and you won't be disappointed.",1
"This is my favorite movie of all time. But it is only for certain kinds of movie watchers. For people who only want to see action and certain female upper body parts this film is not for you. Ask any real movie watcher, they will all say that this is a great movie.",10
I don't like this movie because I don't like this movie,1
"Best Ever Made

The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently.",10
"My family told me this film was a deeply philosophical film which required mature minds to be able to understand. I couldn't disagree more. The Shawshank Redemption is about a man going to prison after being found guilty of murder of his wife, later to be discovered he was wrongly convicted. The story goes from Robbins being a small fish in a big pond in the prison to being a respected figure throughout the film and various events happening along the way. This picture is the only to make me lie awake at night thinking about life and its dreams. I cried during Shawshank and I'm proud of it, I've never felt so passionate about life and its important things. The Shawshank Redemption is about Love For Friends, Hope, Death, Humanity and Loss. Thank You",8
A truly wonderful movie about patience and hard work,10
"One of my all time favorite movies along with The Green Mile. I love the Stephen King stories of both and I thought they did an excellent job of making movies from them. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are excellent as usual. If you haven't seen this movie you should try it. I don't think you will be disappointed. Excellent characters throughout the movie and a most enjoyable watch. Also if you get the chance read the Stephen King story it was adapted from.

You don't have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy this movie so give it a try. Well I am trying to write something without giving a spoiler or putting in junk words but it seems IMDb insists I write at least 10 lines of text when just 3 or 4 lines would do.",10
"The IMDb rating of this pedestrian story which relies on the audience manipulation formula ""prisoners good /prisons bad"" has proven to me that we are neck deep into the decline of all things cultural. When they sell more prints of the Elvis,Bogart, and Marilyn Monroe version of Edward Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" we know we have a problem. When the people who have the Elvis version see the real ""Nighthawks"" and get confused, we have additional problems. When Stephen King's name is bandied about as someone's favorite ""author"" we have Code Red. When Tim Robbins is regarded as some sort of screen presence that can catapult a movie to a # 2 spot we have meltdown.There hasn't been a movie with this much depth since ""The Longest Yard."" I read a comment earlier by a poster who said that this movie will drop off the list when the IMDb reviewers grew up.

Sadly, their bodies already have, and their minds which will never catch up. Pass the Velveeta...",10
"This movie is a heart felt classic. One of the best of all time. And thats because it's one of the best story's of all time, combined with a great plot, great acting, and great script. Quotable, emotional, and all about redeeming one's life.

It contains great tragedy with great camaraderie. The villain, who is the warden at the Prison, may be one of the most well developed villains ever. You see his weakness and his strength. You see the same qualities in yourself in the mistakes you made. And when he collapses at the end, you hate and pity him at the same time. Andy, the lead character, is perhaps the greatest heroin. He doesn't possess special powers to make him great. He possesses the best of human nature. He's tough, enduring, passionate, smart, and pure of heart.

Had to review this movie when I saw the Godfather creeping up on it in the IMDb top 250. Godfather is not the same caliber. Anyone can appreciate this movie. There are plenty of people who would feel 'Out of Touch' with The Godfather, but they arn't reviewing it.",10
"Having seen this movie several years ago, I decided to rent it again since I couldn't totally recall the movie. And yes, it being number 1 on the top 250 list made me want to see it again. I decided to go into the movie as if i hadn't seen it before to completely enjoy every aspect of it. The first thing I noticed was its amazing story, and even better, its gripping tale that hooks you from the very beginning. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) give superb performances. I would go as far as to say that Shawshank is Freeman's best movie (besides Seven). The plot is amazing, with many sub-plots and twists that keep you from doing anything else. And the best part: the ending of the movie. I don't want to give away anything about it, but I'll just say that it rivals the ending of The Usual Suspects in every possible way. All in all, great story, great acting, great plot, awesome ending. What else could you want in a movie?

10/10 and nothing short of the best movie of all time.",10
"By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.

While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.

With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of Randy N. Welsh this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors Randy N. Welsh who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank Randy N. Welsh and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. Randy N. Welsh",10
"There are already excellent 2,296 review for this movie. So Why I need to add one to it? See the question? ""need.."", yes my friends I need to say how excellent this movie is. And how ""sticky"" it to your heart and mind. This Movie surely is one of the few movie that can caught your attention from the very beginning and never let your eyes go from the screen.

Cause from deep in my heart, I think everybody must see this movie. It's cover many aspect in our lives and is packed with beautiful picture and dialog.

Morgan Freeman got a special place in my heart since I saw this movie. HIs performance and narrating was give the ""lethal"" touch to this movie.

Tim Robbins was perfect for the role and so the other cast. Thanks for Mr Darabont for doing great job adapted Stephen King's short story.

Thank You all for this great movie. You guys make life more beautiful",10
"This show was great. In my opinion it is the best show that Tim Robbins is in, Morgan Freeman's best show as well (besides Se7en). But still a great film.

10/10",10
This is the best of all time... There can be no better person for the role of Morgan Freeman and the storyline is just the best...,10
"This was one of the most excellent movie I have ever seen. Such great acting and characters this movie turns out to be more than your expectations. You might see many jail movies but nothing is even near to this movie. The best line is ""Andy Dufresne was my friend."" The way Morgan freeman says it, it's wonderful. Acting of Tim Robbins is remarkable. I really wonder why this movie could not win Oscars. Having Morgan Freeman in film itself is a tag of excellent script. Besides that direction is also very well done. You will not have seen such planned and brilliant movie till now Do watch it. This movie deserves to be on top.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont in 1994 is the masterpiece of all masterpieces.",10

Believe me, if you love cinema, you really need to watch this movie, because, there's something in him, that makes you believe that you can do everything, every problem is your life, you can get it thought!

""Shawshank Redemption"" is the perfect example that, life.....is really a movie!",10
"Despite all of it's flaws, it is a good film. A film I can watch over and over. It sticks, it holds, it is like great mascara and hairspray rolled into one big great mess. Andy is like me. Red is like me. Brooks....

I like a lot about it. It's spellbounding. A picture worth a thousand words breathtaking. Living inside it, not imagining anything else. It is a wonderful amazing piece of rubbish.

I'd like to thank Darabont, the screenwriter and the director, for finding a heart in a story to give to the masses. We love you too.

Give it up for Mr. Andy Dufresne!",10
"In this moving and dramatic portrayl of the imprisonment of an influencial man (Tim Robbins) in Shawshank prison. This man builds up strong relationships and is a benefit to the lives of many in the prison.

Tim Robbins plays his character with superb acting, backed up by an equally amazing supporting cast. The story takes the main character, Dufrain, and his friends on a journey through the rigures of prison life.

Wonderfully directed and produced, this film topped the box office chart and was quite rightly rated extreemly highly among imdb users when it first came out. This fantastic film has new suprises at every corner. Do not miss it!",9

This is a perfect movie. I love the message of hope.,8
"Just great no more words, everyone should watch this.",10
Shawshank Redemption has been in my top ten movies for a long long time. It's a beautiful story of hope. The filmmaking is utterly exquisite.,8
Easily a top 10 movie to add to your list. A must watch.,10
"My review will be short and simple.

This movie deserves to be number one in the IMDb top list. It is very much worth watching. I saw it when it was new and now, years later, it still has the same power. It is a timeless masterpiece.

The writing, the acting, the emotion are all superb. The story and characters draw you in and keep you captivated form the beginning of the movie right up until the end.

I will not discuss the contents of the story as I do not want to post accidental spoilers. I can honestly say, if you haven't seen this movie already you need to go out and watch it right now.",10
"Everything has been said about this movie ...so many reviews,but if you are reading my review then trust me on this..there is no movie been made in any language,country or in this planet which can match this masterpiece ..this is a simple movie ..nothing special about it..2 main characters talking for 2.30 hours ..then why everyone giving it a 10?? just go and watch it to understand that this is beyond a just called movie it's an experience of a lifetime..Every second you spend to watch it will be more then worth..everything you will experience while watching it will stay with you for your lifetime..everything you knew about class movies will be re-written by this ..it might turn out to be a life changing piece of work for you..A MOVIE U MUST SEE BEFORE YOU DIE.",10
"I have to say: Yes, it is a great movie, but it came directly from a short story wrote by Stephen King, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption...so if you read the story after the movie you'll find that basically they use it as a script because there is not modification at all. So the movie was good but did not received any big price due to in this year it was in the same Oscar with Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. The story is very dramatic and started when a very smart bank vice president is sent to prison because was found guilty in court to kill his wife and her lover. In prison he would be facing very strong situations as a smart accountant he is bringing a new face to the prison and to his life.

The director Frank Darabont also was in charge of the Script.",7
HOLY JESUS! A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.,10
The whole Brooks scenes are the best pieces of cinema fulls stop,8
"This is simply marvelous entertainment that breathes life into a genre that I thought had been dead for a decade-the prison picture. But to call ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a prison picture is as accurate as calling ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" a hospital picture. Those are the settings of these similar films, but they really are inspirational dramas of individuals struggling against overbearing authority. Tim Robbins, one of our best, most casual, young actors, plays a banker in the 1940s who is falsely sent to Shawshank Prison for the death of his wife and her lover. In this maximum security penitentiary, Robbins is harassed by the warden, beaten by guards, and sexually abused by inmates. The first and best friend he makes is the elder statesman of the yard, a longtime convict played by the great Morgan Freeman. Over time, Robbins will make other friends, some of whom will be absolutely paralyzed by freedom in the straight world. Even better than ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates the world of overbearing closure that is prison. ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" was set in confinement, too, and like that story, the narrative drive of ""The Shawshank Redemption""- based on a story by the prolific Stephen King-is a journey of freedom, physical and psychological. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes out of nowhere in the sense that it is a first feature film by Frank Darabont, who, with this one work, declares himself a special talent. He adapted King's story for the screen and insisted on directing the story too, much in the same way that Sylvester Stallone could not be pried loose from ""Rocky."" Guts equals glory. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is playing at the Water Tower and Old Orchard Theaters. If you can't get into see ""Quiz Show,"" this should be your next choice.",10
Why everyone need to whatch this movie ? Cause its amazing!,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film worth watching. Well-written, well directed and well shot, this film is entertaining throughout. It's a real tear-jerker with deep meaning, and is a must-watch for anyone remotely interested in movies. The only negative is that the story's a little far-fetched, but it barely affects enjoyment of this film.

The plot summary might make The Shawshank Redemption sound a little boring to the modern-day film fanatic, but it really isn't. It's filled with dramatic tension and is both depressing and uplifting, which is a quite rare characteristic for a film to have. This movie is not to be missed.",10
"I have seen this movie over and over, and I have never been able to find any movie better then this one. Every time I watch this movie I see something new. I would call this perfect. And then 7 Oscar Nominations and the place here at IMDb top 250 speaks for it self I think.

I am gonna give my comment on it anyways.

First of all the movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, one of my favorite writers. Some of his books have become terrible movies, while some of them are classics. Movies like The Green Mile, Stand By Me, The Shining etc, they are all classics, and this one just stand out to be the best of them all.

Secondly the actors. Morgan Freeman who never does a bad job in a movie, and if it wasn't for Forest Gump that came out the same year, I am sure he would have been winning best Actor that year at the Oscars. Same goes for Tim Robbins, another class actor, and here he really is at his best. Actually, I cant find any actor making a bad job in this movie, not even small roles from supporting characters.

The sound track might not be the most exciting, but it for sure really suits the movie, and does not spoil any of the dialogs. The cutting, and the way the movie is filmed is also one of the best I ever seen.

In the beginning there is a court where Andy Duofrense played by Tim Robbins try to claim his innocence after his wife have been murdered. Even if he is innocence all proves against him and he get judged to prison. It all start out with the new prisoners arriving. Andy Duofrense is one of those, and he seem to be one who does not seem to be bothered about being in a prison, cause he walk around like he was a free bird who could leave his cage whenever he wants.

Eventually Andy and Red(Morgan Freeman) becomes friends, and Red is the guy in the prison who can fix everything. So Andy asks Red to fix a poster and a small hammer for him. That is eventually the key to freedom..

There is a lot of lovely scenes in this movie. Like when Andy managed to get his prisoner m8's beer while they are fixing the roof.

I ain't gonna say more about this movie, cause it really is one long lovely story, and you have to see it.

I rate this 10/10, and it is the perfect movie, and the only movie I rated 10!",9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a 1994 drama film directed by Frank Darabont and based on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. The film is a masterpiece of storytelling, with deep themes, memorable characters, and exceptional performances.

The film's themes are powerful and thought-provoking. At its core, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is about the resilience of the human spirit and the power of hope in even the most dire circumstances. It explores complex issues like institutionalization, corruption, and redemption with intelligence and sensitivity. The story is told with an unflinching honesty that draws the audience in and keeps them engaged from beginning to end.

The acting in the film is nothing short of exceptional. Tim Robbins delivers a nuanced and understated performance as Andy, perfectly capturing his quiet strength and determination. Morgan Freeman is equally outstanding as Red, a fellow prisoner who becomes Andy's closest friend. The chemistry between the two actors is palpable and adds an extra layer of depth to their characters.

The supporting cast is also impressive, with each actor bringing a unique flavor to their role. Bob Gunton is especially noteworthy as Warden Norton, the corrupt and authoritarian leader of the prison. His performance is chilling and unforgettable.

Overall, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a true masterpiece of cinema. Its themes are timeless and universal, its characters are unforgettable, and its storytelling is flawless. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, and one that deserves to be watched again and again. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and give it a watch.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is undeniably well made, like a Gourmet Cheeto. But it fails to satisfy because a Cheeto, no matter how you dress it, is just a Cheeto. The problem is that this movie wants to be two contradictory things that end up canceling each other out. On the one hand, with its superb cinematography, excellent score, and 2 hours and 22 minute runtime, The Shawshank Redemption wants to be epic in scale and make a serious statement about the human spirit. On the other hand, it too wants to be super accessible, with characters straight out of the pages of a comic book, watered down philosophical observations, and impossible to believe scenes, like the one in the prison yard, where the inmates are awestruck by the opera coming out from the PA system as if they were hearing the voice of God himself. Clearly The Shawshank Redemption wants to have its cake and eat it. It wants to be very intellectual but very accessible at the same time. In the end, what you get is something that looks like the real deal, but feels hollow inside, like a Cheeto. The thing is, the world is in love with Cheetos, which are overrated. Just like this movie.",10
Andy and Red are 100% in love and I stand by that. No two people would go through the lengths they did at the end to be with each other unless they're in love.,10
If you haven't watched the movie yet you must have been lying under the stone for the last 26 years! This movie really deserves to be on the top! It's the world's greatest movie ever made and ever will be! I've been watching it at least 15 times and it's never getting boring! It's a masterpiece!,8
"We can live tough lives, but the human spirit is stronger, seemingly, than anything. There is redemption, hope, and love. All different forms of heartbreak, but beyond all that there is hope, there is love. There is beauty and bliss.",10
"If you're in the mood for a good movie based on a true story that takes place during a seemingly simpler time and played by really great actors, then this movie is a good choice. A man wrongly accused of murdering his wife is sent to prison where he meets his new life long best friend, Red. It is the type of movie that pulls you in close so that you can't help but to like these ""criminals"". It's not often that any movie good or bad has a good ending. This movie has a very good ending and leaves you with the answers you were looking for. You laugh, cry (or at least feel like you might),get mad and cheer for the good guys and the mild mannered sarcasm. A man who never should have been in prison in the first place ended up making it a much better place, exposed tax scam, educated others, provided tax advice, made life long friends, developed allies and THEN receives his redemption. It's a battle of wits, showing of strength and endurance of pain (emotional & physical) throughout the movie. I have never met anyone who hasn't absolutely loved this movie.",9
There is something about this movie that brings a sense of joy and gravity. Morgan Freeman is a masterclass. If you're seeking a new perception of life then this is a must watch.,10
"This is one of the best movies I've ever watched and it can soothe anyone, relax them to not lose their hope no matter how bad the situation is because it is the best of things. It can move you and can even change you from within bringing to you the thought that not everything in the world needs a reason to be done. Although the main value or 'thing' that this movie promotes is hope, it has lots and lots of other things hidden inside it like humanity, sympathy, addiction and 'institutionalization'. It can be viewed by every other individual in his/her own perspective and be be appreciated in numerous ways. One can always find a new way to cherish it after every view. The acting by everyone is just beyond description. You may forget for a moment that they are actors. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's performance just phenomenal and completely sucked us in like they were our close ones. In the end, I just want to say that this is a masterpiece and I doubt whether another like this will be created in a long time to come. In my opinion, filmmakers should go back to the origin of Art which is for pleasure and relaxation of mind and soul and stop wasting money on high-budget action flicks which are worthless(I am not saying all) and make films like this one which are a delight to watch and a lot to learn from.",10
"Stephen King has been known for writing stories that have both confused and amused the readers. Many great directors have worked with his stories and have given the audience what they want to see. The Shawshank Redemption is another one of them. But there is a reason why it is not just another one of them.

The movie represents courage, faith, anger, sufferance, patience and all the other components of a perfect drama. It teaches so much and is quite a slow movie. Yet it is one of the most exiting movies I have seen in my life. The greatest thing about this movie is that it won't ever bore you. When you sit to watch a 142 minute long movie, it is not unnatural to look at the clock and see how much of it is left. But I have not looked at the clock once in all the many times that I have seen this movie. The time frame where the movie takes place is very large. But for not once have I felt that it was going too fast.

Director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay for the movie did a great job with excellent actors like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. He made this movie into one of the best there is and one of the best there will ever be.",9
I actually do not had the hobbies of watching classical drama thriller ..But this movie made me stunned ...superb Movie ..Loved it ..go for it..,10
"This is such an incredible movie; if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out. I hate what happened to the main character, but the ending makes up for all of it.",10
"This is masterpieces, this movie can not be made..any better nor can they .. Direction,Acting, Story, Dialogue 10 out of all 10....hatts of frank darabont..this movie my inspiration..i love this movie",10

"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman A man who plans his escape for 18 years and the only guilty man (Freeman) watches him all along but never comes to know about his plans. 18 years in confinement and still remaining sane is the true definition of someone who calls himself a life loving person. .. His struggle throughout the prison on dealing with inmates and warden and all the other things is depicted in a very surreal fashion. I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.",10
"I decided to watch this movie when I saw it on the top of IMDb list. and even tho there are many great movies this is kind of movie which would be liked by majority of the world.

This is an amazing story about a man during his long-term imprisonment. Morgan Freeman is undoubtedly a great actor and we find him as a supporting actor has been really trendy culture in the modern cinema.

The movie has a really great plot, full of interesting dialogues you need to pause if you blink your eye. It really sticks to your chair.

I think this is my favorite movie so far as well. I just gave 9 out of 10 because I hardly give 10/10 to anything in my life cuz there is always room for improvement.",9
"One of the best movies I have ever seen. I love Stephen King, and I am always excited to see one of his books turned into a movie. Shawshank Redemption is an classic, a movie that everyone should watch. I loved the chemistry between the two main actors. For people who have not read the book (but also for the book lovers) the movie will be an exciting experience till the last scene.Even now, after more than 20 years, modern movies cannot be compared to this one. Morgan Freeman is as always excellent. U get an mix of emotions watching Shawshank redemption. You feel sad, happy, compassionate, all at the same time for prisoners... Brooks as a character and his story-line broke my heart and i still feel the sadness for this character.",10
"This is something we expect from Morgan Freeman. The simplicity of the story throughout the movie and the sudden change of mood in the climax baffles you to the extent that you re-watch the movie to check if you missed anything. The acting is natural enough to give critics a hard time finding a flaw. The message of remaining patient and not losing hope is mentioned so well that it can motivate you at any day of your life. Loved it. It surely deserves to be at the top for eternity. If you haven't watched it yet then just drop all your work and watch it first. I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch movie online.. Highly recommended.",10
"If there is one word which entails the entire message of this film, it is HOPE. Though I have never been a Stephen King fan, this is one story which makes him deserve accolades over and over again. When I was watching the movie, halfway through it, I admit I was bored. And when Tommy (Gil Bellows) was shot, I was like ""Who the hell recommended me this movie??"". But still I just wanted to get this movie over with, so I watched further. And when that scene comes where the warden throws a pebble at the poster and it tears right through!!! My God!!! My mouth was agape the whole time!!! What a fantastic ending!. The movie indeed has the best finale in cinematic history.(The Usual Suspects comes a close second..). Performances were superb.. (..I still think Tim Robbins deserved a nomination more than Morgan Freeman..). The wardens were damn good as the tormentors. But overall, I believe the story itself deserves a special place in the annals of great cinema!!!",9
"If there ever has been a list of movie that you can watch for unlimited number of times.... and have the same level of enjoyment and thrill, this movie easily will top that list.

The classic story plot revolving around a jail inmate who probably didn't commit the crime and various stages of emotional levels that a person experiences while in jail.

The best thing about this movie is the calm posture of the main lead under all circumstances. He has done proper justice to his character and has delivered an excellent performance. Morgan freeman on the other hand have supported the main lead up to the fullest. His face expressions were so real that as if he is actually there. The other cast has also done justice to their characters.

The music in the entire movie is so smooth that you won't even notice it. But the best thing in the whole package it the script. I wonder which script will surpass the excellence of shawshank redemption.

On the whole, the best movie that you will ever watch (till to date) . I recommend movie viewers to keep a copy of this in their library and whenever you feel low or need motivation, turn this movie on yo squeeze the lemons of life.",10
"Excellent Movie! A must see for everyone! This is one of the best movies you can see even though it's from 1994 (old, but gold)!",9
"This film is an awesome creation but I don't think it deserves to be in the first place. Don't get offended. It's my personal opinion. If you have watched Prison Break Series (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455275/), I don't think you will enjoy this movie. Because, The Shawshank Redemption is a kind of shortcut version of Prison Break Series. But, I enjoyed the movie. Thanks",10
"This movie shows us the power of perseverance. Whenever I felt low , I watched this movie. True masterpiece.",7
"One night when i was browsing through the channels and my dad was doing laundry. The Shawshank Redemption came up and he said it was one of his favorite films. I had no idea why until i watched it. The movies performances, specifically Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, are both incredibly complex and are both Oscar quality. The set of the prison and supporting cast and extras are all masterfully organized. The story is crisp and original, and has deep emotion to it. This movie received 7 Oscar nominations and won none, i believe because Forrest Gump stole all the thunder. But if it were my choice, The Shawshank Redemption would have won Best Picture and is in my mind the best film i have ever seen.",10
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen it is classic of a life time Just stunning I watched this movie over 20 times One thing I Don t understand is the idiots who gave 1 rating for this movie,10
"This is one of those movies that doesn't make sense until you're older.

I grew up with so many references and nods to Shawshank in pop-culture, that I thought I knew what it was all about, and never really bothered to sit down and watch it, until I was older & got into that weird 'watch all the most iconic films ever' phase.

The Library stuff was a shot to the heart, I was a library kid growing up, so it was really engaging as a storyline. The beers on the roof part was such good storytelling as well, it made the viewer feel the satisfaction of small victories, and simple pleasures after hard work....it reminded me of reading a book.

It was a poetic movie... old-school, but unmistakably classic... majestic writing....believable dialogue, heartfelt & eager acting from the people on-screen... the whole thing is just a really great culmination of Art Realized.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" takes a look at life behind bars from a whole, new perspective. Rather than your basic break for freedom plot, this film focuses on the cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the iron bars and barbed wire. The story takes place between the years of 1947 through to 1966 and follows the struggle of one-time successful and promising banker Andy Dufresne. Dufresne was convicted of the murder of his wife and lover when he is sent to Shawshank State Prison and sentenced to life behind bars. It is in Shawshank where he forms a friendship with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, the ""Sears and Roebuck"" of Shawshank and uses his ""hope"" to get through life behind bars. It is he (""Red"") who narrates the film which, rather than interfere upon the story, sustains and facilitates the film to make for an incredibly powerful and moving account of life inside prison. Director, Frank Darabont directs a magnitude of remarkable performances. Most notably from Tim Robbins who gives an exceptional performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman who's performance as 'Red' makes for a fascinating and intriguing film. Fine supporting performances also come from Bob Gunton (Warden Samuel Norton), William Sadler (Heywood), and Clancy Brown (Captain Byron T. Hadley) but remarkably, one of the first-class performances comes from James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen. The scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank make for one of the film's most moving, effective and powerful sequences. ""The Shawshank Redepmtion"" is a truly remarkable film and is utterly unique not just in the prison drama genre but in the history of film its self.

My Rating : An Outstanding 10/10",2
The BEST i like it cast and scenario its amazing i love it,10
"I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies. And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Needless to say an all time great. One of the few movies you can watch over and over. The acting in incredible, the story is captivating and engaging, and every actor comes through in a big way. A truly wonderful movie. If you have not seen it, you will not be disappointed when you do.",10
"This is a must watch movie in every once life,love it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that ""entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie"". this movie give a valuable message ""if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose HOPE""",10
"I don't know what it is about this film but you feel a real connection with Robbin's character, the whole film flows together really nicely plus Morgan Freeman's performance is excellent. The payoff at the end of the film is also really good and I think really makes the film as a whole. A definite must watch if you've got a fair bit of time to set aside - it's a long film - not a very tense film but a quality watch none the less.",10
"The film is based on a novel by Stephen King with the same title. The film talks about human beings being free. The choice of prison was a sign of reality, where prison is a place where freedoms are robbed. The looting of freedom contained in the film does not speak of the individual behavior of the Beshrbel talking about the robbery of the meaning of freedom, where the regime and religion impose their authority on reality. In order to complete the picture, we find in the film harassment, punishment, a group embracing the thought of prison, the change imposed by life on people because of the loss of hope. This is shown in Brooks' character, where he lived in Shawshank 50 years and could not accept freedom and life when he came out. Scene interview interview with the personality of Reed is one of the most important scenes from my point of view, whenever asked by the body for reasons of acceptance to exit, we find that he is eligible to go out because he is a good person! But when Reid talks about the third time that the person who entered the prison is not the same person sitting in front of them they decided to accept him, why? Because he became a man of freedom and will. In the end, the film explains how a person can escape from Shawshank, starting with the desire for freedom until he actually does this. Andy's 17-year-old personality has been carved into the rock until he can open a tunnel to freedom. Andi's quest for freedom has not killed him, but has made him complete his life to the end. , We can easily see this in Andy's own faith to the extent that he began to misappropriate money from the prison director personally. There is a snapshot, a small detail summarizing all this Mozart song, which I have run, I advise you to search for the origin of this song to be impressed. Thank you and I hope you enjoyed my review of the film.",10

"Its a masterpiece. never miss this film. The film make me believe about hope a thing more often people ignore, but it is very much useful in real life and facing real life problems.",10
"Perhaps the only flaw this movie has is that it may be a bit over-the-top sentimental, but that is the charm of it as well. I enjoy that we can see the good in these people who were always good. It gives us hope that we are all redeemable. Stephen King is a better writer with this type of story. Some of his horror falls into stereotypes.",10
This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Its thrilling and moving and just perfection. Its a movie to watch before you die for sure !,9
This movie is perfect in everything that it does and is at this time my favourite movie. I would recommend it to everybody.,9
This movie is a once in a lifetime. Life lesson. It has everything to make you think about your life. I would definitely watch again and with some people even better. I bought this title for blu ray and it is one of my favorites with gladiator.,10
"An emotional story of how nothing can break the human spirit. A truly deeply effective story about the relationship between a new prisoner and a cynical lifer. Morgan Freeman's performance is one of the best in cinema history. And Tim Robbin's portrayal of a wrongly convicted man is played to a tee. This is one of the most perfect casts ever to be set in a movie. Every actor in the movie plays their part perfectly. This movie is undeniably powerful of how prison can take your life, your freedom but there is one one thing they can't get to, that they can't touch, hope. If you only see one movie for the rest of your life make it this one. You will not be disappointed.",6
"How one can go through his/her life without having seen this film baffles me. On a technical level, the film is essentially flawless. but it succeeds even more on such a greater level. Film was not created for the mind, to be over-analysed and critiqued to the point of removing all feeling and stripping a piece of art down to its individual frames. Film was created for the heart, and there's a reason Shawshank is rated #1 of all time, and will never be beaten. The raw emotion and empathy we feel toward Andy throughout the film says much about the successes of humanity, and more importantly the power of hope. Everyone involved in this film caught lighting in a bottle and made quite possibly the greatest piece of art of the 20th century, if not of all time. Beats Forrest Gump any day of the week.",10
"This is undoubtedly the best movie i have ever seen..i will never be tired of watching this movie over and over again. the story, the acting of the actors everything is just toooooooooooooooo good.",8
"Awesome Flick! love how the story line makes perfect sense, Enjoy every scene. motivated me to gain more experience in wanting to be come an Actor and Want to gain more experience in wanting to work with many directors as well.",10
The Best Film in Top 250 is One of the Great Films I've ever Seen in this Masterpiece you can find a way for life crisis The Shawshank redemption is a film for Relaxing especially end of it when red came to Andy I Think this sense even better than red's Escape but why many of world people love the film? I Think everyone can enjoy it length of film is 142 mins maybe more for a film with no action sense but I think no one end of it but a question for me is why darabont can't make masterpieces like it and green mile rhythm of movie is an important thing for addressed in the Shawshank redemption rhythm don't tire you and characters are not superstars with more ability than a human Andy could find a way for escape because he was an innocent man and don't kill his wife and prison is a character in this film like green mile maybe you loved like or hate this movie but I am one of the fans of darabont's masterpiece,10
"This is one of Best and finest Movie ever made in the world. How many times you want to Watch... You will like it. I watched this movie in 2005 and today is 2021. Still love this movie. There are several movies made on Prison.. but it is one Unique. If you want to Watch TV series, pls do watch 'Prison Break'. A lots of Love to this Move. Highly recommended.",10
Such a nice movie it is. Very thought provoking. It taught and gave a lot of HOPE. Shown the beauty of FRIENDSHIP. And most of all proved that THE RESULT OF HARD WORK IS ALWAYS SWEET.,10
"Such a good movie. Everything fell into place. The actors, the ideas, the decor. Everything was awesome. I'll watch it again soon. Seen it two times by now.",9
"I regret that I missed seeing this one on the big screen. Unfortunately, I avoided it because Stephen King wrote it, and I had stereo-typed it as a horror flick. I only decided to see it on VHS (without reading a review) after seeing its incredibly high ranking in the IMDB Top 250.

In fact, this is an amazing story of inner strength and human spirit, more from the side of King that gave us ""Stand By Me"" than the side responsible for ""Cujo"".

Very deserving of the Best Picture nomination.",1
"Not really a lot you can you say about this film that hasn't already been said.

One of my all time favourite films. How Morgan Freeman didn't get a best supporting Oscar for this film, I'll never figure out.

Wonderful, amazingly written film. The cast are superb (Tim Robins always underrated as an actor).

Pulls you through every emotion. If you haven't seen this film then you you don't know what you've been missing. A must have for any movie buff.

It didn't do so well at the box office, but this movies reputation has grown over the years through word of mouth, showings on television and then of course along came the video then DVD rentals.",10
"I just watched Shawshank for the nth time tonight (it was on TNT), and realized why I enjoyed the movie so much: it had one of the most cinematic, enthralling, and satisfying conclusion in movie history. Not that I am dismissing the great story, honest and absorbing characters, and memorable scenes (the scene where an entire field full of inmates seemingly hypnotized by Mozart's opera music comes to mind). The ending where all of the warden's sins were conveniently exposed may sound contrived in other movies, but brilliant writing filled with dry wit carried the scene through marvelously (Red: ""I'd like to think the last thing that went through the warden's head - other than the bullet - was how in hell Andy Dufresne got the best of him""). And the way the last scene was put together, where Red's narration of 'hopes' melts into a scene where his hopes comes true (when he actually crossed the border and reunited with his old friend), was just magical. It makes me glad that my girlfriend pushed me into watching it (""But it's just a stupid prison movie!"" I lamented). How I was wrong!",9
Just saw this for the first time on TV and I will definitely get a DVD copy for watching again and again. A really great movie! I was mesmerized by Freeman and Robbins acting ability. I felt like they were my personal friends by the end of the movie. I could relate to their inner thoughts and deeds.,10
I'm a big King fan and I loved the book. This is the best screenplay of King's work in my opinion. Brilliant cast and acting. Exceptional story from one of the great writers of our time.,9
This movie is a great example of how a person can be wrongly convicted in today's legal justice system. The movie also shows how someone's patience and determination can lead to their success in the future. The movie is a great drama and one of the best movies I have ever seen!,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of my all time favorites. Robbins and Freeman in particular, but everyone else as well delivers an outstanding performance in this one. Few films, if any, captures your mind like Shawshank does. I just hope my DVD copy don't wear out...",9
"This film sortta runs along and while your watching you dont know why your watching but you cant stop and then when it finishes you think WOW and have the funny feelin in the pit of your stomach and all up your spine, the feelin you get when you know you have watched a cinema masterpiece, i only wish i had been able to see this in the movies rather than on vhs, but it will soon become an addition to my dvd collection.

The acting is superb and the storyline just gives you hope",10
"This is the greatest movie of all time yet to be made. If you have not seen this movie, consider yourself deprived. You have not lived your life, until you view this movie. Nuff said.",10
"One of the most loveable, likeable, adorable movies, which has recall value forever. it leaves a positive impact on the viewer. I was moved by this simple movie which depicts hope, friendship and redemption,",10
"The Shawshank Redemption affords us the opportunity to experience the unique magic of hope, ironically, found in a setting not conducive of such hope: a prison.

Simply put, this transcendent film explores the human condition ranging from blinding rage and sinister avarice to hopeful realism and utter disenchantment.

Played by a selection of actors supplying a wealth of talent to the film, the supporting characters, though differing on the surface, share the one trait of disillusionment, either through glib, passive resignation or fiery, active disgust.

But the principal character, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), does not share this disenchantment, at least not totally. He clings to hope and basic transcendental principles while facing adversity after adversity. Though even Andy becomes shaken from time to time as he is pummeled by the events of life, either induced by the nefarious calculation or hopeless despair of others, he continues with the battle.

Andy is the consummate individual, disallowing what others say to him, invalidating what others do to him, and ultimately defying what would appear to be reality itself in what seems to be a simple effort, primarily, to better his life and, secondarily, to shine the light of hope into the lives of those around him. Indeed, though it would seem that the fates occasionally step in and lend Andy a hand, the awe-inspiring potential for hope must have been intrinsic and innate. And the fact remains that those same fates damned him in the first place. But perhaps, it was all part of the journey...

Well, enough of my thoughts! See for yourself--I easily rate this film as a ten. :-)",6
"I have no doubt in saying that this is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a tale of suffering and despair, but also one of hope and redemption - as the title suggests. The truth of life lies within each one of us - just as it lay within Andy Dufresne - all we have to do is find it. Once you know the truth, it will set you free. The message of this film is that there is always hope, there is always truth, and together these two bring redemption - even in Shawshank!",9
"I am a huge fan of Stephen King, so I had read the story. When I saw it was being made into a movie, I was skeptical at first, as many movies do not live up to the stories or novels they are derived from. Well this one was far better than the story.",9
"Its this kind of movie that lets you know the beauty of the world. Although its kind of ironic that almost all of the movie takes place in a prison, the one place in the world where you'd think you'd be restricted from it. Just seeing it once lets you walk away from it with the biggest feeling of joy, no matter how upset you are about anything else, at that time, that one time, nothing in the world matters. Once its seen more than once, you soon begin to realize all the other side stories and ideas in the movie. It seems that every line in the film has some hidden meaning that you love to try and find. You'll find yourself returning home every night, and staying up, no matter how tired you are, to watch it again. The acting is great, and has made Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman my two favorite actors alongside Kevin Spacey. The movie gives you the feeling that all the men in the jail were imprisoned wrongly and that they are all innocent, but its only because they are actually people and you grow to like and understand them. The ending is very surprising, and rates among the best endings ever with ""The Usual Suspects"", ""The Game"", and ""The Sixth Sense."" The movie is incredible. It is an absloute masterpiece in every way possible. The acting, the directing, the writing, everything. The narrating by Morgan Freeman, who plays Red, is incredible and a story in its own. The only movie i know of that can honorably sit alongside this .. is ""American Beauty"". This film is the greatest movie ever, don't listen to anyone else. When you see it you will believe it, you will understand. "" So after first meeting him, i guess you could say that I liked Andy from the start."" - Red.

No rating could justify this movie. Perfect.",10
"I loved this movie and have watched it over 50 times in a 2 year period; I believe it should have won an academy award, but its my guess that the ""bull queer"" scenes removed any chance of that. The dialog between Andy and Red was spellbinding at times and the interplay between them and the other guys in their clique made it seem like being in prison could be enjoyable. My wife hated the movie because of the scenes containing violence and I have to admit that some of them could have been left out, the movie really didn't need them to be successful or appear real. I originally thought I would hate this movie and didn't see it till it was on HBO TV. The other movies that come close to being most watched are Titanic and a comedy called Midnight run.",10
"Highly reccommended. Best if you watch by yourself. I cried at the end, and I never cry.

Love the friendship between Andy and Red, great performances by both. The plot moves along perfectly, I felt what the characters felt. Rivals ""Seven"" for one of the best endings I have ever seen.",8
"Being the cynic that I am, it's my inclination to look for the weaknesses of films that ultimately detract from their overall quality. How refreshing it is that, on occasion, a film is so masterfully crafted that I can simply take in all that it has to offer. Such is the case with _The Shawshank Redemption_.

And with _The Shawshank Redemption_, it isn't an issue of the excellence of the different components of the film; instead, it's an issue of the way that all of the elements of this movie-- the writing, directing, and acting-- are so vastly superior to those of most every other film.

It's difficult to imagine two things more cliched than ""Prison Dramas"" and films about ""The Triumph of the Human Spirit."" Though _The Shawshank Redemption_ certainly qualifies as both of those cinematic cliches, there's nothing about the film that seems even the least bit tired. The unique characters of Red and Andy Dufrense bring an unexpected liveliness to a film that could have easily been both obvious and trite-- such as _The Green Mile_.

Because of the intelligently-written screenplay, with its engaging plot twists and historically appropriate dialogue, coupled with truly remarkable performances by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman that convey all of the depth and honesty of their challenging characters, _Shawshank_ improves upon the repeated viewings that are necessary to take in all that it has to offer. The unparalleled depth of this movie allow the viewer to gain something new-- and something ultimately positive-- from each additional viewing.

Perhaps the greatest achievement of _The Shawshank Redemption_ is the restraint that director Frank Darabont uses in unfolding this multifaceted story. When approaching a film with even a fraction of the thematic load of this one, most directors simply succumb to the too-easy temptation to tack a didactic, heavy-handed morality statement onto the last sequence. Darabont attains a rare closure; he _doesn't_ moralize. He allows the viewer to make his/her own judgments about each of the characters and the fate that he ultimately meets over the course of the film.

RATING: 10 out of 10. In a decade, _The Shawshank Redemption_ will be grouped into the cinematic canon alongside such triumphs as _Citizen Kane_ and _Dr. Strangelove_. It's not an unmerited distinction. An example of truly flawless filmmaking.",9
"I was stunned when I saw The Shawshank redemption for the first time. Now, more than almost 20 times later, I still can't believe the Academy awards jury, how could they not think this the best movie of all times. So moving, so genial, so breathtaking, just great! The first time I saw the movie I 'didn't really intend to watch it, but as it came out, I couldn't stop watching. You really feel for Andy, you really get involved. And than the ending. Who could have thought.....",8
"This is a story with drama, injustice, pain and real friendship. Both performances ( Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins ) were wonderful, they have made the movie even more interesting!!! No doubt, one of my favourites so far...really it is just to watching it too many times with no possibility of getting bored!!!",7
"All my friends had the same reaction to this movie as I did when first viewing it .. how come I never heard more about it? It was great! The acting was fantastic. The storyline flowed perfectly. The writing and editing couldn't have been better. Clearly, if not pitted against ""Forrest Gump"", ""Little Women"", ""Nell"", ""Quiz Show"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" (wow, what a line-up), I'm sure this movie would have won more awards. Morgan Freeman was great, and Tim Robbins was nothing short of amazing. If you like acting, this movie is a must!",9
"Please somebody tell me, what genre is this film? When i first saw this i was told it was the average prison drama; i came from watching it thinking, yeah right!

This film is without a doubt, the greatest film of all time. The aspect that the film tries to get across to the prison genre is marvelous.

Plot Summary: Andy Deufrasne (Tim Robbins) has been falsely convicted of murdering his beloved wife. Despite his efforts to outwit the courtroom, he is sentenced to two life-sentences in a large maximum security prison called Shawshank. The first few days for Andy are dark to say the least, awaking the drama sense of the whole film. Andy becomes aware of a fellow prisoner known as Red (Morgan Freeman) - 'The man who can get things'. And when Andy asks Red for a small rock hammer (A tiny hammer used for shaping and cleaning small rocks), Red gets the impression that Andy isn't your everyday inmate. Time goes on and Red becomes more and more aware of Andy's excentricity.

Favourite Quote: 'Andy gave us the two things we all loathed, time and patience; because that's all it takes really, time and patience' - Freeman.

Rating: 10/10",10
"This is the best movie ever made. If you haven't seen it yet, stop doing whatever it is that you are doing, go to your local video store, shell out the three or four dollars to rent the videotape or DVD, go home, put some popcorn in the microwave, put the movie in, turn on your home entertainment center, sit on the couch, and WATCH THIS MOVIE. If you have friends who haven't seen it yet, tell them to come over and watch it with you. You will not be disappointed. They will not be disappointed. This is the best movie ever made.",9
"There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very powerful and important motion picture. But, due to the R rating, there are certain situations that are somewhat shocking in nature. A few cuts might have helped move the story along, too. Otherwise, an ok film.",10
Someone please tell me why this film is number two when it has a 9.0 user rating. Perhaps the mafia has an insider here to keep the Godfather number 1. Anyway this film deserves to be number 1 for so many reasons. Just see it and you will know why.,7
"It is a movie that focuses on principals and fundamental values of humans beings, such as freedom. It is a movie about dreams, and how to achieve them. About how someone can be a free man while prisoned. About how someone can be a prisoner, while living in open space. Indicating that you must first change yourself internally to what you want to become and then gradually achieve it. Difficulties are to come but nothing hurts unless you get your eyes off your dream.

Institutionalization, is something that many people have been infected with, but they seem not to be able to understand it. You don't have to be in a prison to get institutionalised. Look around you and you will see a race of slaves fighting every day to defend their slavery.

Watch the ""MATRIX"" and don't focus on the fighting scenes, but on the meanings spoken out by Morpheas during the first part of the movie. You will then notice the similarities between the two movies, both concentrating on freedom from a slightly different view angle.

All the above are wooven around a firm and perfect cinematographic structure of excellent performances, brilliant shooting and atmosphere.

If art is to cultivate people, meaning the focusing of people on principles and fundamental values, then ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is sure one of the best tools to fulfill this task.

To me it is one of the few movies that justify the existance of film making. Without such movies cinema would have been a mean of erosion of human personalities.

I have seen this movie 7 times and i keep watching it to remind me of things that everyday routine makes you forget. Things that give happiness to your soul, not your mind. Things that set worthwhile goals for someone. I believe that everyone needs such tools to help him go after his godgiven rights which are neglected everyday due to the soul devastating slavery, our minds put us through. I can honestly say that this movie is the tool for me.

Sure nobody is perfect and someone may point out weaknesses of this film. But he is just missing the forest focusing on the first bush he comes across. What a waste of an opportunity.

I hope that other people like this film and may get something good out of it. I am sure this film won't fit with everyone because everyone is different. But it will always be one of the best film i have ever seen.",10
"one that will stay at the top of my list for a very very long time. i've watched this movie ever and over again and i still am amazed by how good the movie is. it's a very enlightening movie that will make you think about many things about your life and what have you done in live. i guess every one of you have watched this excellent peace of art, so i guess you have the same feeling as i have right now. too bad this awesome movie do not enter my country in indonesia, so not many people can appreciate the sheer quality of shawshank redemption.

a very touching movie indeed.",7
"The Shawshank Redemption made me spend a good evening when I watched it. Though quiet common, the plot has a good rythm. The beginning of the movie is even very common, with the scene of a murder and the following trial. The story in the prison goes rather slowly. The actors are good, especially Morgan Freeman. It is a good entertainment, but nothing more.",8
"This film is an absolute beauty, but no-one seems to have picked up on the music. It's a fantastically atmospheric and sparsely written piano/strings score by Thomas Newman, and does exactly what a good film score should do: enhances the atmosphere 110 percent without ever intruding on, or detracting from, the visuals. Quality stuff!",8
"Shawshank Redemption is one of those few movies which can only be made when all things come together. Narrative, Scenario pacing, cinematography, performance and directing are only some of the main elements that make for a great movie when all are in balance to serve the main purpose which is the storytelling. But sometimes GOD says let there be that moment when every other aspect, of the greatest art form in cinema history, swells the other up to make magic happen on and behind the white screen!

There is no need to elaborate on Shawshank Redemption because those whom have witnessed it knows it's power and grandeur in appearance.

For those whom haven't crossed paths with Shawshank Redemption yet should by all means necesary make it a lifes effort to rent and buy this Movie. Before you leave this place you once knew as Mother Earth you need to have experienced one of the greater feelings in cinema history!

I hope I myself as a Filmmaker will come across a breathtaking story like this to film, there is simply no greater reward to a filmmaker than to have directed a Movie like this.

In closing I will add, for those running off to the store looking for Shawshank Redemption, look up these next films for they will change your life for they have changed mine and made me become a filmmaker.

It's a wonderful life (Frank Capra), Ben Hur (William Wyler), Ran (Akira Kurosawa) and M (Fritz Lang).

There are many other great movies but for starters just start with these cause you'll be watching these a many a times.",9
"When I first read the reviews of this movie I was stunned but later I thought why not to atleast give it a try and I think it was a great decision . I never thought that Andy which felt like a cry baby would do things but he did it .

Acting Acting is the best Complete masterpiece really

Filmography I think can't describe it in words .

Conclusion It brings tears of happiness and also give all of us a hope

Just don't waste your time reading reviews just see it . It will be one of your best decisions of your life .",10
"Really shocked by the true feelings of this film, it is worthy of a long-lasting good film, other feelings, I believe that you will experience the natural experience.",10
"No words describe this movie, the best there is, the best there ever will be.",10
Listen man I really liked this movie but the cheese grater scene was just weird. Other than that I really liked this movie. It is unforgettable and yeah,9
Best movie... I cried at the end... Watching in 2019 still AWSOME... Masterpiece,10
"I loved every moment and line from this this movie right from the opening scene to the end credits.the movie is about andy dufresne a man convicted of murder who is put in shawshank state prison.He strikes up a friendship with the prison fixer red.After having a rough time in the prison he manages to make it in prison becoming very successful with the library and with the guards and the warden.There is the an arrival of a new inmate which turns the plot right around,leading up to the greatest ending ever seen in a movie.i highly recommend seing this movie,in fact go see it right now!. I promise you will love it(im not lying!).thankyou, now go watch it!.",10
"Every once in a while you come across a movie which touches your heart in a way you cannot describe. It moves you and affects your take on life. This is one such movie. It will fill you with an undefinable happiness and you'll never be able to get enough of it.

The Acting: Splendid acting by Tim Robbins. He carries the role of an educated lawyer partial to music with enviable charm and subtlety. Morgan Freeman of course is as good as ever. His narrations are always a cherry on the cake.

The Soundtrack: An elegantly restrained balance between the grim tones of the Shawshank Prison and the more melodic influences of hope. Perfectly in conjunction with the acting.

I hope anyone who hasn't seen this movie, sees it. ""I Hope...""",10
I feel like this movie is overrated. Everything was on point except for the story.,4
"The movie is really but the 1st half is too slow, the movie is not meant for those who like adventurous movie.",10
"It's was good , have a very good message of never loose hope even in bad times.

It is well ahead of time when it was made.. seeing it after 40 year still worth it ..",9
Quite good but nowhere near as good as scooby doo 2 monsters unleashed,10
"One of the greatest movies of all time, definitely recommend if you haven't seen it. It's definitely something special.",10
Totally flawless original movie worth watching its one of those movies that just leaves you feeling good and satisfied,10
"This movie is by far the best movie i've seen in my life, i'm only 18 mind, but still, excellent, i would recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it watch it. The actors really play convincing parts, even the minor roles are played out well. I really can't say a bad thing about this movie. I wouldn't want to spoil the movie for someone who hasn't seen it. All i can say is watch it!! this movie should not in anyway be turned down because ""it is just a prison movie"" this movie is much more than this...

It is really cheep as well, if you want to buy it in HMV i bought it from there for £1.99 which i thought was an absolute bargain!! go buy it for yourself now if you haven't got it!!",10
"Nothing else to say, just well done. Amazing cast of actors",10
"""The Shawshenk Redemption"" is not a regular experience. It's a compeling story about two prisoners who's holding to the only thing shawshenk is trying to break for them - hope. Darabont delievered one of the cinema's finest production works, and personally for me the greatest movie ever made. He knows at which points to touch, at our most universal and deep points. And I think its length is just a plus because in its first views you feel like all its heaviness falling apart towards the end has been recharged for almost two hours. I've seen a lot of movies in my life, no one touched me at all points like him.",10
This movie was very better than i expected:) i love morgan friman and i want to see se7en tonight. join me please:),10
"Nevers gets old great family classic rigth there ,,,great movies keep it going",10
"TL;DR Classic. A Must Watch. 9/10.

While Mr. King is no stranger to writing in other genres, and has built a fine reputation with that on its own, he's definitely proven that he's the King of Modern Horror (see what I did there ;) ) and I think this adaption pushes perfectly the idea of Mr. King being possibly even the King Of Modern Literature.

Though personally visually or aesthetically, I did not find it very appeal it (which I do value), for this film it works perfectly.

A story grounded in reality. Our Reality. Its message can be applied to us all, despite its simpleness. It's explored in an endearing and emotional way that is shown through its beautifully portrayed and written cast of characters.

Will you cry? Maybe if you're that kind of person. Will you enjoy, remember, and connect with the story? A big fat yes.",10
"This beautiful film from Frank Darabont is an absolute joy to behold. a wonderful blend of drama, warmth, sadness and joy. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have never been better, giving performances that should have won the relevant oscars hands down, but they and Frank Darabont(director) were absolutley robbed on Oscar night. This is a film that deserves to be watched again and again.

Let's not forget Thomas Newman's moving score that captures the film's mood perfectly, where you can close your eyes and feel the emotions running through your whole body. This film is also a rarity in that this is probably the best film adaption of a Stephen King story since The Dead Zone.

The Perfect Film? I think perhaps it is.",9
"Overall this film hits every mark: Great acting, an engaging story arc, and wonderful character development and portrayal.",9
"""The true masterpiece"" This movie has a quite way defining the life, struggles, deep happiness and sadness. The director has completely understood the movie and so all his efforts we can see here.

Nothing less than a Divine Gift to the World. Once anyone sees definitely he is going to repeat it a lot often.

Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman) both have best performances. The best ending scene of this movie I have ever scene showing kind of Deja-Vu and Divine feeling to me.

It is the movie about friendship and slow-redemption. You might not blink for a second to see what next it would lead to. Each character is fitted to their roles perfectly and they have given a flawless justification to that. A prison life is depicted in this movie which is looks vivid.

I would say that this movie is aptly rated. This movie has a way to touch your heart by means of showing a true Hope.",9
I saw this movie 1 year before but movies like this never get out of your mind and same happened here i have not forgot anything and will never forget this one.this is a rare masterpiece not to be missed by all.Everyone should watch this movie at least once in their life because this has a much big impact.i love this and is truly one of the greatest artwork in history of cinema. Do watch it with your family.,8
"I have always wanted to see this movie, partially because of Being the top movie in IMDb and for the cast in the movie. Form the starting of the movie, I was at the edge of my seat going through an emotional and motivational ride throughout. This movie teaches us the value of love, friendship, betrayal, disappointment and how to be hopeful always. It was one of the finest adopt from the book (by Stephen King) to a movie. Was a enthralling ride throughout. Frank Darabont did an excellent Direction, along with the cinematography of Roger Deakins. The acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were excellent. One of the must watches!",10
"The concept is often used interchangeably with that of film reviews. A implies a recommendation aimed at consumers,",10
"Good movies can always be read in various ways after being watched. For example, ""Redemption of Shawshank"" contains freedom and hope, friendship and persistence, dreams and pursuits, God helpers, etc. There are so many meanings, the wide range of interpretations, and the far-reaching impact, well deserved. In addition, on Rhett's evaluation of prison life: At first we hated it, then we liked it, and in the end we found that it was inseparable from it, and it had the understanding and meaning of institutionalization and social identity in sociology. In short, no matter how to interpret, the pessimist can always find strength in this film, let the optimist go more calmly, and make the pessimist full of power. This is perhaps the deepest meaning in the film ""Redemption of Shawshank"".",10
"When I had finished watching the movie,I was excited and wanted to watch it again.I like Andy ,for his talent and his wisedom . And the most important thing that I like is his spirit-never giving up.",9
"""It's a must-see movie for men. ""Everybody says that. But by distinguishing only from gender, the film will be narrow. ""Shawshank's Redemption"" breaks through the confines of a man's film, with an almost incredibly warm tone, and the film's greatest theme is ""Hope."" Classic movies are called classic, because they're all doing the same thing - let you appreciate the beauty of hope from a different perspective.",8
I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.,10
"At that year's Academy Awards ceremony, it was covered up by the soaring ""Forrest Gump"", and with the passage of time, the position of the film in more and more people's hearts has surpassed ""Forrest Gump"". Whenever the reality makes me feel so tired that I feel powerless, I can turn over this disc and regain strength. There is no doubt that this film ranks in the top three movies that men must watch! Looking back on that classic line: ""some people's wings are so brilliant that even the darkest prison in the world can't besiege them for a long time!""",10
"Great storyline. Great casting, a great movie overall (pièce de résistance).",10
"The best interpretation of hope People in the wall always cry for freedom, but we really get the wall? The oscars were overshadowed by forrest gump in its heyday, and as time went on, the film surpassed forrest gump in the hearts of more and more people. Whenever reality makes me feel powerless, I flip out this disc and regain my strength. Without a doubt, this movie is among the top three must-see movies for men! Recall that a classic line: ""some people's wings are so bright, even the world's darkest prison, also can not long besieged him!""",9
"All time fav. Movie i feel like i lived their life, could not be better than this.",10
"I am very disapointed to see that this very average american hollywood film is rated as high as #2 on the top 250.

Seeing as the many dozens of reviewers has written before me I will only state why this film qualifies as one of the most overrated films of history.

The ONLY thing this movie has is the story and the cutting filmnarratology and even this does not stand out from the rest very much. Based on a mediocre book, this film is a good display of craftsmanship, not art. The way the film tells its story is not creative or new in any way, instead it follows existing hollywood tradition by the book.",10
"i watched this movie a 10 times...still not a bit bored..this is the most Beuiful and greatest movie...the screenplay is perfect and the actors are performing just like the prisoners in the jail.The casting of the movie is just perfectly great,i can't think anyone other than the those actors in respective roles.Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman is just great to watch.If you didn't watched this movie you have just lost something...hope...the greatest of things...the movie starts with Tim Robbins sent into the jail for murdering his wife and lover..and imprisoned for two life sentence.he has seen worried in the beginning but he retains hope to survive.When i watched the climax when Andy escapes from the prison i can't believe the moment and i rewind it for another ten times..just incredible movie",8
Powerful message well acted and conveyed. Relevant. One of my top films!,5
"This might be my most brief review ever.

I've seen this move a couple of times and each time I always find something good to say about it.

From the amazing cast to the directing , cinematography and general storytelling, this movie ticks all the boxes and sets a prescient for how a good movie should be made.

If you are reading this and you haven't seen it yet, I won't give you any spoilers. All I will say is , this is one of those movies you don't just put on while you're doing something else. It's one of those where you need to invest time so you can appreciate all the subject matters discussed.",9

Can watch again is my classification of a good movie and you can watch this one again,9
"A movie that I think is very good, but unfortunately I am too young. I didn't see it at the beginning, but now I don't think it is against it. It is really a classic and never out of date",10
Tears were almost coming.Wanted to cry but couldn't.What a film.My rating 10/10,10
"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen no matter who you are you should love this movie and if you havn't seen it, see it! Tim Robbins gives a performance that is probly one of the most unforgetable also Morgan Freeman gives just as good of a performance. This movie has no flaws and it is SO good",10
"Best movie ever made. Finest of all, the engagement with the characters in the film is just simply amazing. Too good!",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption,"" directed by Frank Darabont, is an absolute masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of traditional cinema. This film, based on a Stephen King novella, weaves a captivating narrative of hope, redemption, and the indomitable human spirit.

One of the film's most outstanding aspects is its exceptional character development. The protagonist, Andy Dufresne, portrayed by Tim Robbins, undergoes a profound transformation during his time in Shawshank Prison.

Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Ellis ""Red"" Redding is equally brilliant, providing a poignant voice-over narration that immerses the audience in the story.

It is a film that moves, inspires, and lingers in the hearts of those who have the privilege of watching it.

"Honestly, I don't think I could ever say there's a greatest movie of all time but a collection of movies worth considering. This is definitely belongs there. I've seen this movie over 100 times, and it always moves me. It's powerful & beautiful movie about the power of hope, friendship, revenge, and of course redemption. It's timeless and relatable and full of life quotes.",10
Excellent movie 🍿 I suggest to watch it alone this is not the movie that you enjoy with your friends but seeing it alone will make you to connect more to the story . Your brain will analyse the every detail which you might miss with your friends,10
"BEAUTIFUL STORY.Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography.Simply marvelous.",10
"This film is absolutely everything. Ever word came out was spoken like a true prodigy. This film had drama, emotions, amazing plot and almost everything I want in a movie. During these 2 hours and 22 minutes, i felt like living in a completelydifferent universe. A-grade movie making at its best.",10
"Drama on this movie is deep, this movie not only about escaping from prison but tell about relations cast. Morgan Freeman young is Old haha.",10
"No.1 movie for me,life changing.I naver seen a movie like this it keeps you tidely in every seen",8
"Without the hope and freedom in our life, what should we do? Some people would fail to face to it,but the hero of the film is not a weak man as we image, he is a successor because he save himself.

The Shaw shank Redemption is an old story .The young banker -Andy was undeserved, but was sentenced. In the long and hopeless time, people in the prison, not only to confront the wretched environment and the execrable turkey, but also to be controlled by the institution and to be hurt by the sore feeling. ¡°These walls are kind of funny like that: first you hate them, then you get used to them. Enough time pass, get so you depend on them."" The institution was deathly; did you have enough courage to suspect it? As the miserable old librarian in the film, he lived in prison for most of his life, he adapted the life of prison, and so he can't live without the acquaintance and familiar environment. What he only can do was to make himself evaporated in the world, which did not, belongs to him.

But, for those execrable environments, Andy was a strong man although he looks gentle and weak .He did his work on his own way and kept the freedom in his mind. First, he learn to tough in the wretched environment, and then he became a hard-bitten person. Secondly, he also has the good friendship with his friends. Then they can help each other. Third, he can toady the person who can give him rights to prepare to flee for his life. Fourth, he caught opportunities for his life and believed every dog has his own day. Then did many things to prepare for the plan .19 years passed, with the freedom in his mind; he got his new life outside of the prison at last. The freedom belongs to him.

From the film, I understand the truth: In the walleyed floor of despair, where is God? Everyone is God for oneself. If you give up yourself, no one can help you. But if you save yourself, the hope and freedom will belong to you one day!",10
"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).

In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.

In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".

In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.

The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.

After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.",9
Deserves its title. A must watch and a masterpiece.,10
It is one of those crossover movies that ends up on everyone's favorite list. I own a copy and revisit it a couple times a year.,9
"Everyone who has watched "" Shawshank redemption"" knows that Andy was undeserved to be in prison. If it were you what would you do? Snarl? Complain the unfair society? I will probably get suicide for the innocence. For I am not strong enough and there is not so much power to support me to go on my life with such heavy burden. After sentenced to prison Andy was silent. However there was an underset hidden in Andy's heart while he looked quiet. ¡°Get busy living, or get busy dying¡± reminds me a saying by famous Chinese writer Luxun. That is ¡°break out in silence or perdition in silence.

There is another set of dialogue that is impressive. Red: ¡°Hope is a dangerous thing¡± but Andy said: ¡°Hope is a good thing.¡± His escaping is the strongest evidence. Andy got a hope for which he can be busy. No other than this conviction set him free once more. Andy is a bird with beautiful feather and it is sin to forbid him in prison. Escaping is predetermined. Miracle is coming true by Andy's Rock-hammer.

In the film, dialogue between Andy and Red and Red's monologue described vivid interpersonal activity. And this peaceful talking may stimulate readers' inner billows better than exciting dialogue. Andy's guilt to his wife has been released and got redemption after locking in Shawshank prison for nineteen years.The heaviest burden of a person in one's lifetime is from inside rather than outside. Lots of lines in the film are valuable for us to take our time to taste it. And everyone shall remember that hope is a good thing.",10
"A fantastic movie that rewards the viewer with immense satisfaction after many scenes of suffering and tragedy. A great movie to watch if you enjoy emotional and gripping stories.

Rating: A+",10
I don't know how to describe it but it's just beyond expectations,10
"Watching this movie was a pleasure, the acting was outrageously good. A film without special effects and action every 5 minutes, just men in prison. All I can say is I would have loved this film to have been longer.

The acting from Morgan Freeman is second to none, he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens.

Anyone who hasn't seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films.",10
"I saw this film many years ago. From this film I got to know for the first time what is acting and what is an actor. If I had got more than 10 ratings on IMDb, I would have given this film.",6
Recommended/ What a great story. Love it and I always watch it.,10
This American classic addresses issues of the prison system and corruption from powerful positions. The question proposed in this movie tackles the topic of if prisons are designed for rehabilitation or not? This movie has a beautiful progression building to a crescendo leading to the back end of the movie. This film also contains a fantastic side story that will tear at your heart strings. This movie is written to make you wish for freedom just as the characters yearn for. This movie is a must watch classic with great writing and a great cast to carry out the script.,10
I don't have words to explain how best this movie is !!,9
"It's not that good. For me it is average. I mean, there other dramas I'd prefer to see before repeating this movie.",10
Awesome movie! A small preview of what life means behind of prison accusing you for something that never done by you.,10
Nice movie must watch. Nice drama and story of this movie .,9
This movie is great Ita my forever movie .. I will watch it always,10
About the movie! Best movie in history! It was incredible. You should definitely watch.,10
I really like it and i learn a lot from this great movie 🎥,10
"The Shawshank Redemption. I watched this absolute Gem of a movie in 2021 for the first time... And it immediately has to be one of the best and among my favorites of all time... The Characters, the acting, the cinematography everything is soo great... Tim Robbins (as Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (as Red) deliver absolute masterclass performances and make us fall in love with them and root for their friendship, hope and the life behind the bars against the system... No fancy cinematography, action, graphics yet Frank Darabont was able to put together this masterclass more than 26 years ago... There's nothing about the movie that hasn't already been said... Rightfully maintaining it's place in the top IMDB list... The Shawshank Redemption is a treat to watch again and again and will be for decades to come....",10
Don't have words to explained awesome cool super duper hit hat kat amazing sizzler my gosh I watch 12 times.,9
Awsome super duper Fantastic marwslous amazing story oh my gosh climax blast wow 😲,10
"After watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I realize that the comment I saw on the movie were not exaggerating, not a movie with light sabers, nor with mafia phrases, much less killing to kill bill, but if you have two men talking to each teaching us to value life. I've always been looking for the perfect movie for me perfect film is one that touches the soul, this movie, no effects, no fiction, I was succeeded, I found the perfect movie. Showing us a point of view that many perhaps have not known yet, one of the few movies that generates feeling.That's why it makes the best movie made so far ""Keep busy living or get busy dying""",10
"All recomendations for this movie,moive have all it need.I was sceptic when i started to watch but now all i have to say is BRILIANT",10
"I read a review once that said ""If you are not even feeling slightly uplifted by the end of this movie, you are made of stone."" I couldn't have said it better. Some scenes may not sit well with the easily disturbed, but there you are.

Go see it. 9/10.",10
"It's simply the best film I've ever seen. The highest standard of film making. Everything from the acting, to the direction, writing, pace... it's all perfect. There's a fantastic core story accompanied by sub-plots, twists and turns, which keep you captivated throughout the film. It's perfect.",9
"This is an excellent movie for me. It gives me a great fleeing and experience. It is the greatest movie that I have ever seen in my whole life. I always recommend to my friends and family to see and enjoy the movie. I think it is a worthy movie that teach a lot for everybody. First, I went to see the movie at once of those a famous theater over the winter of 1999. I had enjoyed it from my heart and soul. And I had tried to understand the main theme of the movie. It was full of real fact that touched me to my heart. After watching the move I tell about it to my friends and family as an interesting story.",8
"I realize it every time I see this movie... This is the best movie I have ever seen! It's just great! I mean, the story is strong and so are the actors. The music fits perfectly in the movie and it's one of the most clever movies I've seen. After seeing this movie for the first time in '96 I thought WOW! I went to rent it and watched it again. It got my attention that it was based on a novel. So I ordered the novel. It's my favorite book now. I must have read it more then ten times. After that I saw the other stories were filmed too. So I went to rent them too. They are very good too, but The Shawshank Redemption is the best. 5 Years later I'm one of Stephen King's and Tim Robbins' biggest fans in the world. Everybody who hasn't seen it yet: take my advise and watch it. You'll share my opinion: it's the best movie you'll ever see. Now it's finally available on DVD in Holland too, so I can watch it with hopefully lots of extras...",10
"The other day we watched the movie ""Escape from Shawshank"" (1994) with a friend, which I want to tell you about today.

The story is about Andy Dufresne, who was put in Shawshank Prison (one of the strictest prisons), for the murder of his wife and her lover, which he never admitted at trial... It would seem that the plot of the drama is not new, but despite this, the film is really interesting, so we watched it with pleasure, especially since the cast of the film is wonderful.

We liked the movie ""Escape from Shawshank"", so I recommend it to you, too, if of course you haven't watched this movie yet.

Thank you for your attention and see you soon!",10
"I can't tell what it is. You just sit and watch the entire movie. You look, you look, you look. And you worry. The film is a chronicle, a chronicle of the life of a very smart man who ended up in Shawshank prison for life. He experiences everything, different events happen. Here is a drama with tears, and a comedy with smiles and a tense ending. This film combines everything that has been invented before. The film is the ideal that everyone aspires to.

10/10.",10
Shawshank Redemption is one of my all time favorites. This is the kind of film that I find myself watching at least three times a year since it first hit the screens. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are quite dynamic along with the rest of the cast. I was fortunate to film another movie in the same location as the final scene of Shawshank and it was quite a special beach. The movie claims it was in Mexico but the beach was in St. Croix.,10
"I was from China. My families were victims of religious persecutions. When I grew up, I watched how people lose everything for refusing to give up their beliefs. In my college years, I was aimless. Everything I own felt like illusions. Nothing really matters.

I was troubled by insomnia at that time. One night in my senior year, I felt really down and couldn't sleep again. I decided to watch a movie to get through the long night. I opened The Shawshank Redemption.

I remember after the ending, I walked to the window. It was about four or five o'clock in the morning. Everywhere was so quiet. All I can hear was the breaths of other roommates sleeping in the dorm. I stood in the dim light, my mind was blank. It was beyond words to describe my feelings of watching that movie. Before I climbed back to bed, one clear and strong thought formed in my mind: I need to get out of this country.

It was almost ten years ago. Lots of things happened later but I made it to the US. I believed this film encouraged many ones like me, to go for the freedom that seemed to be so unreachable. Thank you for people who writes this story, and who make this film.",9
"A film full of emotions, with a stunning story,skilled actors and Meaningful, A very fascinating story and proper soundtrack with each scene.

You won't get bored when you see this movie But you'll be more eager to see it continue.

You'll be upset for a moment while you see the movie And you'll also have a smile on your lips for a moment and This means life, And life can be cruel to you,And sometimes be kind to you.

There are dialogues that teach human beings the greatest Lessons and This film must be understood, we must understand deeply with our emotions to get the pleasure of seeing it.

And the biggest lesson I've learned is:The bird does not belong to the cage.",10
"Hope is a good thing and maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.

It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another.

Get busy living, or get busy dying.",10
"One of the best films of all time. A source of inspiration and emotion. A reminder that no matter how dire life is, hope always survives.",10
"One of the best and must watch movie which i ever enjoyed....Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",10
The film's Best film in the history. This film have sad story without spoilers in my opinion you should seen thes film. Because have perfect story The Best aktars and have many Best things of course you like this film.,9
"Well it's not really a review but I just wanted to say a few things I guess. First of all i was going to log ""Her"" as my first movie but I forgot to, and now I just finished the Shawshank Redemption only a few minutes ago and decided it was more fitting to put it as my first review because it's #1 in the imbd top 250. I'm not really sure if I'll be using this app much in the future since I've been using letteboxd for a few months now and I think it's really great, it has a nice simple interface for beggingers and longtime users alike. But Yms (Your Movie Sucks YouTube channel) prefers to use imbd so I thought I'd give it a shot and see if I'll like it enough to continue using it alongside letterboxd. That's pretty much everything I have to say.

(Most of my movie logs on letterboxd aren't really reviews but just some joke relating to the movie and stuff like that so maybe I'll use imbd as a place to write about films I'm passionate about and have a lot to say on. Sorry if I'm rambling a lot and if this text has some spelling or grammar mistakes I don't want to proofread lol).",10
"Having seen such a movie again and again, you subconsciencly begin to look for flaws or errors that will somehow lift it off its pedestal, just so you can put your already tiresome mind at ease and not give it another thought. But with this movie, im still looking, so i'm beginning to got used to the fact that this movie will, and more than likely, always be jumping to the top of my mind whenever i try and define 'what a movie CAN be'.

It's already a classic....",10
"I think that is a best movie of cinema history.

This kind of movies are really rare and i never found such a movie anymore.

After this i suggest you all watch godfather series.",10
Morgan Freeman gave a nice performance however Tim Robbins possessed no emotion whatsoever and I cared little if even at all for any of the characters. Not particularly well written with a warm message that is delivered over an overly long period of time.,10
"Hollywood should takes notes from this movie. The writing was very good/screenplay based on two short stories. Directing and acting was flawless. Every character was real, alive and believable. 10 out of 10. It's the perfect movie.",10
"Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue. It is accessible. Regrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it, impossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by ""Shawshank.""

The story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental frameup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil. the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each beat more clichéd that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters, they take the most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also lead to the most obvious destinations.

People also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad, it's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.

I sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers nothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that well.",10
"This film is without a doubt, one of the all time classics. It has everything - drama, comedy, suspense. Watching this film leaves you with a good feeling - it makes you realise that true friendship is hard to find but something to really cherish. The story of Andy & Red (The 2 main characters), and how they go about living in the prison is moving, gritty and very realistic. I recommend this film to everyone, young and old, it will appeal to everyone. Its a brilliant film capped by a brilliant ending. 10/10",10
"A friend of mine who unbelievably loves movies, share an information about this movie by the time i won a local short film award in Indonesia. He simply said that this is a must-see movie for a director or DP. So i tried hard to search for this film and finally found it. Before seeing the movie, i read the credit title that impressed me instantly. I thought ""this is not gonna be bad at all"". From the very first scene to the last of it, I can only comment that this film really inspires me to write, produce and direct a neat story telling concept with a surprising ending. No wonder it gets the highest rated film here because the moment i reached the ending, i can only WOW it. Genius!",9
"This film of the nineties was issued in 1994 And be the owner of a prominent layer serious and intelligent character then Zjk with criminals and murderers in prisons Shawshank Redemption environment for the murder and killed ?!

This type of movies or stories possible we followed many of them in these years, but strongly this output? I can not imagine.

Actor Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have played their role very excellent, I have not seen for Tim, but this film indeed.

In fact movies jailbreak Tsthoeni strangely

Nothing like The Shawshank Redemption",9
"I first saw this film some years ago and it left a deep impression on my mind. Recently I made a list of films that I had seen before that I would like to see again. Top of my list was The Shawshank Redemption. All I could remember of the film was that it was about 2 men in Prison BUT that it had made a deep impression on me and I wanted to see it again. I got to see it again and I was not disappointed. It was on local TV and even all the ads couldn't spoil it. I was entranced by the two chief characters who were superb and also by the secondary characters. As the final credits rolled I felt as though I could watch it again and pick up on things that I had missed. I've never felt like that before about any film. I haven't checked as to whether this movie received any Oscars but it certainly should have for the characters, for the story, for best film and so on. I highly recommend this movie. Definitely 10/10. I'm off to find it on DVD.",10
"I will not rehash the plot outline as many other reviewers have done a fine job of presenting it. Note, however, that this is not an action/adventure film. It is not fast-paced. It is grueling and harsh in part. But it evolves into a moving story of the triumph of indomitable human spirit over crushing adversity.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" packs an intense and unforgettable emotional wallop. Thanks to a perfect blend of cinematography, acting, soundtrack, and plot development, the film takes the viewer on an unforgettable emotional roller coaster ride. It masterfully elicits powerful emotions running the gamut from the lowest lows to the highest highs.

I read a great number of other IMDb members' excellent comments on this film. I think it is safe to say that those of us who rate ""Shawshank"" among our favorite movies share one view in common --we truly FELT the impact of this film.

Some who disliked the film have argued that certain aspects of the plot are unrealistic. I must note that I thoroughly enjoyed the plot itself. Nonetheless, is every element of the story realistic? It really doesn't matter.

This is not a purely plot-driven vehicle. This is far more than a ""life in prison"" film. The prison serves as the framework in an ongoing struggle between hope and hopelessness under the most adverse circumstances. The beauty of ""Shawshank"" is the way it excels in evoking a great range of human emotions while presenting a fulfilling and moving tale of resilient human spirit.

Whether viewed as ""true to life"" or a parable, ""Shawshank"" succeeds in making us really care about the main characters. It is unsurpassed in making the viewer feel the full emotional impact of events as they unfold. It excels in making us feel fine gradations of despair and hope, cruelty and kindness, hatred and friendship, sadness and joy.

Along with the excellence of the film as a whole, I consider a certain scene among the most intense, fulfilling and memorable moments I have experienced in cinema. (I won't discuss it for the benefit of those who have not yet seen the film.)

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a true masterpiece of film making. It is unsurpassed in evoking a full range of intense human emotions as it proceeds to an unforgettable conclusion. It fully deserves its place as one of the all-time greats in film history.",10
"This was a movie I wanted to see for some time, and when I finally got to see it it didn't disappoint me. On the contrary, it was the best movie I've ever seen.

Very good story. This is a movie I'll watch a lot more... the best ever!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are handing out the best performances of there life in this film. Its about how a banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) goes through prison. And along the way becomes best friends with Red(Freeman). This story is all about hope and friendship. This films has several very moving scenes. From the rooftop scene to the ending (the best ending ever). And the movie kinda has 4 endings. (4 best endings ever). Should have taken home best picture, original score, screenplay (Frank Darabont), and cinamitography oscars. But was over looked by forrest gump (which is good, but not better then shawshank) and pulp fiction (still yet to see). ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""... thats damn right.

10/10 A+",10
"One of the greatest movies of all time! The back bone of the film is the relationship between the two characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman(both, great acting) .I like the way their friendship is depicted.How it evolves and stuff.Couldn't be more similar to life!Anyway it is a kickass movie!No-one should regret the time they spent on this!",7
"Beautiful, fantastic , mind-blowing, heartwarming,plot-twist",8
"Simply stated, this may be the best movie of all time. The story is infinitely engaging, the acting is impeccable, the cinematography is marvelous, and the score is wonderful. It is probably the most well rounded film you can hope to watch.

I saw it first in 1995 on video and was amazed that it did not win a single Academy award. It certainly should have. Do yourself a favor. If you really want to see a true work of cinematic art, see this movie.

FOR THE NAY SAYERS: They say that if you are young and NOT liberal you don't have a heart, and that if you are old and NOT conservative, you don't have a brain. Well, no matter what age you are, if you do NOT enjoy this movie you don't have a heart or a brain!",9
The plot and the actors amazed me. The ninetees clearly were the best era of movies and this one is a great example.,8
"This film in my opinion is one of the best ever made. When I went to the video store one time in 1999, I was in the mood for a drama. It was a toss-up between Shawshank and some other movie. I chose Shawshank. The plot outline on the back of the movie box was very intriguing. It is most definetly the best movie I have ever picked out at a video store. I liked the movie so much that I went and bought it the next day. Few movies have as much talent and drive as this one. Two of the best actors in my opinion, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. What an excellent acting duo. It's a shame that this movie lost Best Picture to 'Forest Gump'. Gump was good, but this one was much better. I gave it a 10. What a great movie!",10
"For me this film is about as close to perfection as I can imagine. Somehow a first time director's adaptation of a fairly average and forgotten novella by a horror writer has turned out to be one of the most beloved movies ever made. Watching this film is truly a magical and life affirming experience, which profoundly affected me after seeing it for the first time. Andy's journey as he crawls through ""a river of s*** and comes out clean on the other side"" as red puts it, has become an inspiration to millions of people. The film's central message, that hope can lead us by the hand through the darkest times in our lives, and give us the courage to go on, is surely one of the most eloquent and beautiful sentiments ever delivered through the media of cinema. This film has become a modern phenomenon, a cultural benchmark, and has proved the incredible power that movies still posses.",9
"If there is a movie which defines ""masterpiece"" this will be it. It has been a long time I saw a movie which really surprised me. You will never know what is about to come. And when it ends, you find the glimmering shine of hope. If this movie released any year other the year of the Forrest Gump I am sure it would have swept the Academy Awards.

I usually don't like watching a decade old movie, but since this movie, i have already gone through a dozen on the top 250 list. Morgan Freeman is great as usual. So is Tim Robbins and James Whitmore. The whole cast brings alive the spirit of the movie. And my suggestion to all who haven't seen it already would be- add this to the top of your to-do-list.

Fan of such Hope-giving and Inspiring films: Shashank",10
"I can't help but watch and love the Shawshank Redemption EVERY time it appears whilst channel hopping, how the hell was this not a box office success? Just goes to show, box office isn't everything. This is movie perfection.",10
"This film is a film which is moving, dramatic and emotional. It has characters being introduced all throughout the film and makes the film never ending, like Andy's sentence. Freeman and Robbins are both talented actors and bring to the film their own qualities, you never get tired of seeing them. I first saw 'The Green Mile' before i saw this and thought that Frank Darabont made the most moving film ever, but i was wrong. 'The Shawshank Redemption' has scenes of laughter, sad and shear disgust, this is what makes it so powerful. This film is number one in my DVD collection and never get tired of watching it. I honestly recommend it to anyone who likes a late night movie full of emotion.",10
"It is a movie that enthralls my mind and soul, as every time i thought about each & every moment of this wonderful movie.

I say this movie is a journey, not because its a long movie, but it explains a definition of an act of HOPE. Yes, hope is the sweetest weapon of your arsenal that wins you unconquered battles of your life. Of course, it inspires you to danger the risks in achieving something, but yet you go for it.

A fascinating story with an unbelievable & realistic twist that betters the moral & belief in yourself. Mind boggling performances from the actors and a remarkable direction that did 100% justice to story.

A TRUE CLASSIC............",10
"An inspiring and simple drama that will move you with shocking moments and by the end, awe-inspiring sentiment.

Our man gets sent to prison, though we're never quite sure if he done it or not. He meets Morgan Freeman and begins an unforgettable friendship, goes through trying experiences, and learns many things.

In the end, we have an amazing film that will leave you with a sense of awe and inspiration, helping you with the trials of your own life.

IMO, it's not the greatest film ever, definitely not deserving the top spot here on IMDb, but it's still a wonderful film and I recommend it highly.

And though it didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture-that went to Forest Gump, and it was also up against Quiz Show, it is still a film that will always be remembered and cherished.

Very, very good.",10
"This movie was faithful to the excellent Stephen King novella it came from:""Rita Hayward and the Shawshank Redemption"". In spite of injustice, corruption, and brutality, prisoners were able to rise above this and form true friendships. They were able to put real love into action toward each other. When the protagonist, played brilliantly by Tim Robbins, locks himself in the warden's office and plays an exquisite aria from a Mozart opera, the whole prison stops and listens. All are moved by such beauty, beauty they haven't experienced in a long time, if ever. It is my favorite scene from any movie I have ever seen.",9
"As someone who loves his films and has seen many of them. This film is one of the tops. I thought upon receiving this film it would be some boring, over strewn prison film. My god crucify me for i have blasphemed.

The cast are perfect, everyone captured their role perfectly. Especially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Even the minor roles were professionally done.

The story was phenomenal. The way it twists and turns and throws you around with it is something I didn't expect. If something minor happened at one point in the story. You sure as hell better expect it to be brought up later in the film in a way that makes your jaw drop.

This was one of the few films were towards the end, I kept closing my eyes where i thought it would cut to credits. I swear this film could have gone on for another two hours with no affect to the audience because of its depth. It absorbs you like a sponge.

Unless you're blind watch this film. And if you are blind, I'm sorry to hear that.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption {1994)

Tag Line: Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free

Director : Frank Darabont. Cast : Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman.

This movie is considered to be one of the best movies ever made. Unfortunately, this movie was released in 1994, a year dominated by

1. Forrest Gump

""A 6 Oscar Winner Romantic-Drama directed by 'Robert Jemeckis' starring one of the finest actors ever,'Tom Hanks' who undoubtedly deserved the Oscar. This film still stands in the list of top 50 Highest Grossing Movies with over $650million worldwide gross....

* This is my all time favorite, i must say, being a big fan of Tom Hanks :D "" -----------

2. Pulp Fiction

""An Independent Crime-Drama directed by one of the best Screenplay/Script Writer, Quentin Tarantino who got Oscar in the Best Original Screenplay category.

* I still cant see much innovative screenplay than this flick."" -----------

3. The Lion King

""An Animated feature film by Disney Pictures, a major financial success with gross revenue of over $750million and stands as the Highest Grossing 2D animation film of all-time."" -----------

Due to the heavy financial success of the above three flicks, our topic, The Shawshank Redemption[1994] was unnoticed on its release and became a huge financial disaster. But gained good 'Reviews'(for which a lot of viewers don't care for}. The film gained 7 Oscar/Academy Nominations, but hasn't one any.

* This movie is Undoubtedly 'The Greatest Movie' to have not won an Oscar.

* I cant say that, this is my most favorite, but definitely is one of my Top Favorites.

* I think that this movie deserved 2 Oscars, one for The Best Picture of 1994 and another for Best Director.

PS : If you cant understand this note or you think that this is just some sh*t, just try and watch the movie once. Then, you'll definitely agree with me. :)",10
"I break my reviewing of movies down into five aspects, each worth two stars, plot, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and acting. So here's my broken down review of Shawshank Redemption: Plot: One star. While the plot flows neatly, is well developed, and doesn't have any loopholes I noticed, it lacks the originality one would expect from the top rated movie on IMDb. I have no complaints other than the lack of providing me with something truly original and complex. It's not a simple plot, per say, just as it's not an unoriginal plot, but it is by no means an extremely original or complex plot.

Characters: Two stars. No characters went blatantly against psychology, nor did they ever break their characterization. Characterization was pretty good and I have no real complaints, all I would have to question is Andy's character. He was gang raped and got his ass kicked multiple times and was still this calm, cool, collected guy. I don't see how that would work out in the real world, so I didn't find that really believable, but he kept with his characterization and the movie made up for it with the almost relatable nature of Red's character and how well the minor characters were developed. That's probably what blew me away character-wise. No character was exceptionally complex, but all stayed true to their characterization. However, Andy should have been more complex than he was, seeing as how he was the main character.

Cinematography: Two stars. I have no complaints. Camera angles, effects, etc. were very good, though there was nothing exceptional about them that really stood out to me. Though I do realize that it was pretty well done for a 90's movie. Again, no complaints.

Soundtrack: Two stars. Again, very well done, no complaints here. At no time did it overshadow dialogue, and at no time were there awkward silences. However, nothing really stood out to me. Not a soundtrack I'd go on raving to my friends about, but no complaints.

Acting: One star. This is obviously unexpected. I mean, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins...I was surprised I didn't find it amazing. But Morgan Freeman's monologues lacked heart and Tim Robbins' character didn't give him any room for heart to be placed into it. Again, the best acting in the movie, in my opinion, would be from the minor characters. Frank Medrano is worth note, in my opinion, as he was very, very good. But he didn't remain in the movie long, so him and the other minor characters didn't make it enough for me to give acting two stars. I'm sure many people would disagree, though.

All in all, I give this movie eight stars and would recommend it to a friend, but I wouldn't have it rated first on IMDb because, while it was very good, it didn't strike me as THAT good. There are more original movies out there that I would recommend before this, though I do recommend that people watch this movie along with the others.",9
"Without doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does.

This soul finding, awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of Stephen King's 1982 Novella entitled 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'.

This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance 'anything can be over come'. Set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of America.

A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit, and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad (as so many of the inmates succumb to). As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry 'to protect them (me)' so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan Freeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would say was 'Superman'. Eventually like a great master he exposes the lies,hypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul.",10
"Okay, if you seen this film because it was the number one top user rated film on IMDb, you are along with pretty much everybody else including me. This is still a rich film with a great ending and just something that leaves the audience over all happy at the end. The only major issue is how incredibly over-rated this film is, that since its got to that status people start to hate it due to his incredibly inflated ratings. Which is sad, because its a great film, nothing sensationally magical about it, just a solid film that did what it was trying to do. Everything was a little above average on this film, but nothing really stood out to you and made you say 'wow this is brilliant.' It's no a masterpiece by any means just a film that should be respected but in it's entirety nothing more.

I watched this film hoping that since it was number one it would live up to that spot and it fell short for me, but it may just me, and my style of movies. However, I don't really think anybody will hate this film, but I don't think it deserve to be where it is, there are plenty of other films I would choose as 'better' over this one.

Over all it's still a great flick that everybody should ultimately enjoy, but to claim its the best film ever made? Is quite simply entirely untrue. score:7.5 to 8",10
"The Shawshank Redemption improves with every watch, so much so that u almost imagine your place or your role in the prison and try to understand how that lifestyle would affect you. Frank Darabont may all the praise for adapting this novella into such a masterpiece fall on your much deserved shoulders because your style of filmmaking is unique in these times of unsubtle blockbusters. The background to this story is probably too well loved for me to go into but Tim Robbins delivers a painful, regretful, intelligent performance that u cant see coming from any other star. Morgan Freemans brings so much comfort and bitterness to his turn as red that as u reach the end of the film when his smile starts to show and they embrace u know u have just sat through something special. An enriching experience. 10/10",10
"If you're sitting there, like I was a few hours ago; thinking that this film doesn't deserve to be called the Greatest Film of All Time, as IMDb has it placed, then do yourself a favor and watch it first.

I thought this was a popular vote that had no basis in reality, like how people call a new- age pop band the ""best band ever"". I was wrong. Very, very wrong.

I'm not here to tell you that this is the best movie ever made, I can't do that. Movies are about the meaning they have to your life and one's personal experience defines what you relate to, thus that title will always be different for each individual, but what I can do is tell you about the effect it had on me.

First and foremost this is a story about hope. It's not a story about crime & prison, if you adhere to this interpretation then you're not looking deep enough into the themes of the film. Yes, Mr. King uses the story of Andy to communicate his messages, but the narration itself is entirely superficial, this could have just as easily been a story about war, but the conduit he uses is fairly well suited to his goal.

The acting is superb, I couldn't think of a better suited cast. Tim Robbins is fantastic as Andy (The main character), and Morgan Freeman is just as good as his friend. The last time I saw acting this good was in The Godfather. You feel for the characters, not only because of the superb acting but also because the character development is so subtle and concise that by the end of the film you feel as if you've known them all your life.

I'll elaborate on the allegory portrayed. The film explores such areas as corruption, religion, hope, love & integrity. King suggests that hope is the most important thing in life, and those who have lost it ultimately decay into a sea of mediocrity (as shown through contrast between Brooks & Red). This was the theme I found most interesting and applicable to my life, but the rest are equally as touching. Notice the difference in behavior between those who are religious and those who are not, King hints at a perceived justification for evil in the contrast between Andy & the Warden.

Integrity is also portrayed as something delicate and somewhat essential to happiness, like hope. King shows this mainly through the actions of Andy, as embodied in the quote ""The funny thing is - on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook."" (That was not a spoiler, it's fairly obvious that he goes to prison, just by looking at the synopsis)

I don't wish to get into the story too much, just keep these themes in mind when you watch the movie and you'll find it infinitely more rewarding.

In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is the best film of the past 20 years, and while it perhaps doesn't deserve that top spot (I'm still deciding, but I doubt I can convince myself to concede it does), it is still an essential movie in my collection and I wouldn't give it up for anything. It's right up there with The Godfather and The Good, The Bad & The Ugly.

Themes: 100% - Perhaps the best film ever made in this regard.

Acting: 96% - Fabulous performances all round, characters don't age much though.

Story: 98% - A classic, the best King adaption by far.

Lasting appeal: 99% - The only film you can watch 100 times and discover something new each sit through.

Influence: 92% - Watch it and you'll realize how ripped off it's been.

Overall: 98% - It doesn't get much better than that.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film of great passion and gritty script.I love the entire detail structure of the movie.Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.I have almost watched it more than 20 times.

The Bond between the characters played by Morgan Freeman (Red) & Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) feels fabulous when you finishes the film.Script and Dialogues are top notch. Frank Darabont directs with genius and masterfully transcending the script and gives something definitively spectacular. Hope is so powerful that it can make great things happen.Just go for it ...",9
"Possibly the greatest movie i have ever seen and definitely the best in this genre and storyline . great cinematography, acting (specially by Morgan Freeman) & directing . the best thing i loved about this film was the switching of the narrator and leading character from time to time . another great thing about the film is the direction of photography and filming. also great adapted screenplay . watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you involved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. watching it once wont give you much of the taste of it so its best if you watch it at least a few times . Definitely an urgent . don't continue with your life until you haven't seen this.",10
Their are two great things in this world muhammed ali and the shawshank redemption.It is without doubt the best film ever made.A bold statement you say well watch it and then tell me it isnt.Why is it the greatest well thats hard to put a finger on.For one thing the acting superb robbins and freeman give standout performances.The sweeping score and look add to that.Stir in a brillant uplifting story evil villians and a great twist and shawsank can bellow out i am the greatest.,10
"I don't get how this movie could be the best rated in the IMDb. Sure it's good, maybe great, but come on, there are so many movies more meaningful, more groundbreaking, more shaking... That's a clever story with an amazing end. Actually, it's probably one of the happiest movie end. Maybe that's why people like it so much. Sure there is some message about justice, perseverance and courage, but all in all very classic and easy, not to say shallow. So I rated it 7 as an efficient entertaining movie. Nothing really special in the photography, nor in the acting, nor in the staging, nor politically. No complexity in the feelings nor in the characters. Really, it does deserve good critics, but certainly not being ranked best movie ever. I suppose the shawshank fanatics would also give the litterature nobel prize to Stephen King?",10
Have seen this film at least 20 times. Still as good as the first time. Classic indeed.,10
This is the most upvoted movie by the imdb community an a few other polls. it is a masterpiece and a must watch nothing less. i see people saying it is the best movie of all time. well it is not. to major motion picture organizations and critics it is not even the best of 1994.,10
The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect film in every aspect. It has a beautiful score (Thomas Newman) and amazing cinematography. The acting is brilliant and the movie stands up well to repeat viewings. The only minor negative that I have for the film is that the main characters don't seem to age enough in the 20 or 30 years that they're in prison. But this is just a minor quibble. Don't let it deter you from watching this movie. It is a great story and every household should have this in their collection.,10
"Whenever i see Shawshank Redemption at the top of the IMDb top 250, it gives such a beautiful experience. When i just started following good movies, and seeing this movie at the top, i watched it. well i liked this one in the first. but a whole world has turned around. I have watched whole lot of movies, that varies from that of Hollywood to other world movies which are just great. But still till present, Shawshank has not lost any of its aura. it is a beautiful experience watching this movie. many would review this movie as over-hyped, overrated and all. i think they are just trying to describe cinematic experience, but this movie is a Life experience. So that is a point where they differ. The one who says Shawshank is overrated, might not say the same about The Green Mile(same director and author). I have always admired the works of Stephen king, but his works just seemed too much for movies. Even Stanley Kubrick couldn't quite actually cover The Shining. We had to wait until Frank Darabont to get a good portrayal of king's work. and the wait was finally worth it. The green mile is the next, though it isn't as much high on the rating as this one. Just i think this movie was one of many which increased my interest in watching movies. And about the Top position in IMDb, it is absolutely worth it.",10
"This movie has always fascinated me and I have always counted it as one of my favorite movies if not the favorite. I was pleased therefore to find it #2 at IMDb top rated movies of all time. No matter how hard I think I can't really find much fault with it at all. Characters, main and secondary, are all fantastically well played, the plot unfolds at just the right tempo, the surroundings are as realistic as it gets etc etc. The whole movie, though set i a prison with all the violence and dreary atmosphere it brings, still left me with a positive feeling afterward. It's the kind of movie that doesn't leave you, you remember it over and over again with a smile on your lips.

How did this film not win the Oscar.one of everybody best films ever. The acting was superb.,10
"Hope. It is the single most powerful human emotion. It can keep you alive, and it can destroy your life. Hope can be the one thing left in a world where everything else is taken from you- and The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect artistic visualization of the tremendous power that hope can have over someone who has lost everything else.

The opening scene introduces us to a young and successful banker named Andy Dufresne, and the things that have transpired to destroy his life. We can't help but feel sympathy toward a man who finds out that his wife is having an affair, and then gets convicted for the double homicide of his wife and her lover- when he is innocent of the crime. Taken to Shawshank prison for two life sentences, Andy has had his entire life taken from him in a spiral of terrible events. It only gets worse at the prison, as the brutality of the prison guards is unbridled, and a few inmates make his life hell. However, Andy continually surprises the audience with his resilience and his character finds ways to amaze the inmates, the guards, the warden, and the audience. The story itself is not wholly original or groundbreaking, and there is no 'surprise-ending' or major twists that come out of nowhere to shock the audience. However, it is in the delivery of the story that this film excels beyond all others.

Every aspect of this movie compliments the incredible script written by Frank Darabont that was based on Stephen King's novella. The music is a composition of slow-moving and peaceful ballads that bring out just how long-winded a life sentence in prison can be, and how undaunted Andy is by the terrible environment he is in. The cameras move slowly and steadily, repeatedly scanning the prison and also emphasizing the endless span that life in prison truly is. On the artistic side, the movie is something to behold. But ultimately, what brings the entire movie together is the beautifully written and exceptionally delivered narration of Morgan Freeman, playing a fellow inmate named Ellis 'Red' Redding. Not only are we given a view into Andy's character through this man's observations, but we also see how Red himself changes his life as a result of Andy Dufresne.

The amazing thing about this film is how every detail in the entire movie somehow contributes to the story on the whole. It takes a few times of viewing before you can really appreciate just how intricate the plot is- how every single moment helps increase the power of the incredible ending sequence. It is not too complex, with many tangents that end up confusing the viewer. Instead, it runs with a simple theme and adds to it with everything that is depicted. The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that the ending seems a bit drawn out, but by this time you are so enthralled and satisfied as a viewer that it should not pose a problem.

A great story, told flawlessly, with a powerful message. There is not a lot more that you could ask for in a movie. Entertaining and inspiring. Deep, yet not complicated. A message delivered with undeniable power, and an excellent movie experience overall. If you have ever felt like everything has been taken from you, then learn from Andy Dufresne. 'There's something inside that they can't get to, that they can't touch. It's yours.' Hope. It can set you free.",10
"If you are looking for an interesting story that attracts you from start to end without any feeling of boredom, this movie provides a great example of that.

If you are looking for a movie that firms the meanings of deep friendship, and the wonderful feelings that have become rare at this time, this movie takes you far to live these rare feelings.

If you are looking for a story with twists that makes you amazed at the plot twist, I think this movie will surprise you seriously.

If you are looking for an unforgettable movie which sticks in your memory, a movie that stirs and simulates your human feelings, this is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" movie.",10
"At the beginning i thought, this would be an another annoying movie, but now i've a totally different opinion. I saw it yesterday, it was amazing, absolutely amazing! I've got to add this one to my favourite list of movies, which is very short ;): (Finding Forrester, Shawshank, Adrenalin: Fear the rush)

The Shawshank should be on the 1st place in the ""Top 250"", that's the right place for it! 1 of 10, i gave it 10! It's fair enough!",10
"This film is definitely in my top 10 of all time list. It is a powerful story and probably the best movie about friendship ever made. But hands down the one element that makes it a great movie is Morgan Freeman's performance. I've seen this movie a dozen times or more, and his narration never fails to hook me.",10
Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give possibly the best performances of their careers in this adaptation of a Stephen King story. The build is slow but the payoffs are plentiful in this prison drama about friendship and redemption. This is also one of those great movies that get better with each viewing.,9
"I've been wanting to see this movie for a long time, but never could. Finally got an opportunity to see it and to be honest, I was blown away by it. The movie lived up to it's rating here on IMDb.

For me, it's one the finest movies I've ever seen. The entire story is gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat for it's entire duration. The movie wonderfully depicts the harsh life in prison, the helplessness and the eventual coping of the situation.

Freeman plays his role as the supporting actor wonderfully well and his narration is breathtaking. This movie has some of the most amazing dialogues ever in a Hollywood movie.

The core plot of the movie revolves around ""hope"" and the ability to see the silver lining even in the face of extremely challenging situations.

I could draw lots of parallels between this and Schindler's list, which is my most favorite movie of all time. Worth the watch. If you haven't watched this, YOU MUST.

This movie could possibly change your life.",10
"Talk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption (Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New England banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife and her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life sentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a maximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves, rapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when Andy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the veteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad that Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So bad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and raped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take special delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake: Andy gets worked over-and so does the audience.

But then, good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. Early in his stay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red (Morgan Freeman), a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as Shawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the prisoners anything they want-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked ladies (''I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as Andy bonds with Red, things start to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards' tax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He expands the dusty, neglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years (the passing decades are marked by Andy's pinup posters of Rita Hayworth, then Marilyn, then Raquel), The Shawshank Redemption begins as a nightmare, a postwar- New England Midnight Express, but it doesn't take long to reveal its true, feel-good colors. The movie is about survival, triumph, and a thing called hope. It's about a hero who rises above the squalor because he's blessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express Goes Gump.

You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and there's no denying that Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank Redemption (it's based on a short novel by Stephen King), knows just what he's doing. The moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the actors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against. When it comes to a character like the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible- thumping righteousness, the movie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. He starts out mean, then turns meaner, then meaner still. When Andy blasts Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work field, it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number, with the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. It helps, of course, that most of the prisoners don't actually behave like criminals. They never say a word about their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if Darabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas.

A movie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical plotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can carry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and likable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the character's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a laconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid, suggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed about him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate smolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul, makes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he says, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em.

After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's institutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again, isn't it time Morgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick? While we're on the subject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is shouldn't get too used to movies like this one. B-",10
"I saw The Shawshank Redemption only a few weeks ago, while I knew it was number 1 on IMDb Top 250. Knowing the main idea of the movie, I couldn't imagine how this movie can be at the top. I watched it on TV and this was one of those rare films which excited me so much in front of my TV. I will not talk about the acting or the directing because so many reviewers did a better review about that before me but I will just add that what I find so unique to this movie is that he is RIGHT from the beginning to the end. You feel so moved all along the movie and when the movie is over I have this impression that it was a movie quiet ""simple"" shared with a feeling of having saw something that is a way higher others movies. And that is what make this movie extraordinary.",10
"This is a fantastic movie! A strong friendship in a tough prison, a strong movie in the feelings, and a critical comment to American prisons. And a surprising ending!

Fantastic play from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, in every way a great movie.

Andy Dufresne: Mr. Hadley, do you love your wife?

10 out of 10!",10
What can I say this movie is the top of it's class. The Story is great the acting is great . You really care about these characters. Morgan Freeman's performance is the glue that holds the movie together and Tim Robbin's breaks out in this movie showing that he is a great actor. If you like prison films this is the best!,10
"The reason this movie is ranked number one is that it is a tale of hope. It's the story of a man, who claims to be innocent, on the inside of a jail. We witness the cruelties. We witness the sadness. We witness the unforgivable corruption. We never know what Andy is thinking. We see him through the other characters, through their thoughts. Mostly through Morgan Freeman's character, who narrates the film. His portrayal of his character is more than successfully satisfying. He nails it, as he always does. They build real characters who go through real changes, something people can relate to. I'm trying to not reveal any of the plot. The plot is not complex, or not overly complex I should say. It will be easy to follow as long as you start at the beginning. It's the way to movie presents it, the way it reveals itself to the audience is what makes it so brilliant. The plot turns are unexpected. I think that what makes this movie so great is that. The way it keeps you interested, keeps you unprepared. It truly makes you feel for the characters though they're inside a prison. It shows how fragile the situation is on the inside, for all of them.",10
"Whenever this movie comes on I have to watch it. This movie is very compelling and if you have not seen it I'm not going say much to spoil it for you. This movie takes place over a few decades of wrongful imprisonment of a banker who is accused of killing his wife. The time spent in prison is sought with so many horrors as I saw it especially for a man who never should have been imprisoned. The end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a ""What's next"" Like no other. I have seen many movies leaving you or trying to leave you hanging but every time I see the Shawshank Redemption I wonder what occurred after the beach.",7
"A lot of people measure things on a scale of 1 to 10. A lot of times people will say that something was really good and rate that object in the high 9s. A lot times people will say 10 because the movie appealed to them personally, but others will not think so because it did not do the same to them. Universally, however it is hard to give a movie a 10. But, man, oh man, this takes the cake. If this isn't a 10 I don't know what is. This is a masterpiece. Dude, I mean come on, this film is AMAZING! Not based on favorites, but based on the quality of the film, itself, on every level, how can someone not say that this is overall the best film of all time? Story, acting, cinematography, sales,and universal appeal all work together to make this a great movie. This movie is perfect. Perfect, and no one can say a anything to take that away. Ask anyone on the street who has seen this movie and see if they didn't like it. No one will speak ill of this work of art, no one ( 1 in a 1000 at most). If this isn't what a perfect 10 film should be based on, then I don't know what will.

10/10",10
"It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

Several exterior scenes were shot at the Malabar Farm State Park, in nearby Lucas, Ohio. The sequence in which Andy is parked outside his home contemplating murdering his wife was filmed at the Pugh Cabin within the park.

The Shawshank Redemption was filmed in and around the city of Mansfield, Ohio, located in north-central Ohio. The prison featured in the film is the old Ohio State Reformatory immediately north of down town Mansfield.

The sequences representing the village of Buxton and the field where Red finds Andy's hidden letter were filmed on private land located opposite the park entrance on Bromfield Road. The oak tree is clearly visible from the roadside. The adjacent rock wall, which was constructed specifically for the film, is located on the far side of the hill away from the roadside. The wall is still standing, although it has been somewhat eroded. Other scenes were shot in Ashland, Ohio, Butler, Ohio, Upper Sandusky, Ohio and Portland, Maine.

The two scenes in Mexico were filmed on the Island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The first scene where Andy was driving a convertible on a road along the Pacific Coast with the top down is route 73 on the north side of St. Croix between Salt River (where Christopher Columbus landed in 1493) and Cane Bay.

The second scene was the last scene of the movie. Red was walking on a beach toward his friend Andy while he worked on repairs to a boat on the beach. That was filmed at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge on the south west point of St.Croix.",10
"What can I say? What is there left to say?

I still remember the first time I saw this piece of art. I was hooked from the beginning until the end of the credits, with that wonderful score by Thomas Newman.

This movie will make you shiver and leave you with a strange feeling for many days. It's about friendship, it's about hope, it's about life. I believe this is one of the few movies that were flawless from beginning to end, and has one of the best endings of all time. Tim Robbins, along with Morgan Freeman, delivered one of their best performances and teached us a life lesson.

It absolutely deserves the Number 1 place on IMDb's TOP 250 Movies.",10
"The first time I watched this movie was around 10 years ago and since then I forgot its name. two years ago it crossed my mind but I wasn't able to remember the name and i tried every possible way to remember it. finally I got it and I can't describe my feelings at that moment. Since then I watched it for more than 10 times, and I will watch it again. Can any movie beat it?absolutely no What can make sucha movie incredible? everything I rarely cry for a realistic events or for a fiction ones but I cry every time I watch this movie. Is is better than the godfather? out of question Is it gonna be forgotten? No way The movie didn't win any Oscar! who cares",5
"Something about this film, whenever it comes on television it's hard not to watch until the end.",10
Amazing movie. I think the actors were great and that the story was well written and filmed.,6
"The first time i read about this movie, I was sure that this movie is overrated, But after seeing him, I am sure that this movie is underrated It is the best movie ever. It is about hope, passion, love and friendship. I do not think that Hollywood can produce an other movie like that, it one in century. The acting was GENIUS, The script was the best ever, The director was a maestro. A lot of Novel-Moivis not good as the novel, I did not read Stephen King's Novel, but I am sure that the movie is much better. believe me if you saw the movie you will not be able to forget it. Believe me when I say that you will not able to talk after seeing the movie at least for 20 minutes, and the first thing you will say 'Why this sons of bitches did not give it Best Motion Picture'. Well Forrest Gump won it - and I love this movie- but believe they do not deserve it. See the movie, I am sure that this will change your view to the future, to the hope, and to the friendship.",10

Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.",10
This film will go down in history as one of the greats!!!,10
"Timeless classic and doesn't have to brag itself to be known as the most riveting drama of all time, a brilliant main role combination of Freeman and Robbins, exceptionally finished. I think It was a very good movie because the story was very catching, and the film was very exciting because I got him very passionate continue to watch from beginning to end. The film, in my opinion deserve a 10/10. It's an excellent movie, it's a movie you must see. It's an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature. Morgan Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.",9
"Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to appreciate it completely. This is maybe the only movie, in my opinion, that keeps getting better the more times I watch it. Having seen the movie at least 20 times I feel that it is quite possibly the best movie ever made. Some may be more entertaining, like say Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, but none as compelling. The movie creates a world of different emotions, mainly through its two main characters, Red and Andy. The acting is incredible. The message is stronger than that of most any movie, and is stated very clearly. ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" After being drained by the sad events that occur in the movie, the ending uplifts, and thoroughly fulfills the gaps that it could leave you with.

Although this is a great and uplifting movie I realize that are a few things wrong with it, like in any movie. The issue of race is not addressed because it wasn't originally meant to. In Stephen King's short story, Red is white. In casting Morgan Freeman the movie is left a little empty on that subject. This does not devalue it, but does leave the audience a little confused about why it is not addressed. Do not watch this movie and expect to be completely entertained, just watch it for its quality, and maybe you'll be left with as much thought-provoking material as I was. I am glad it is ranked as high as it is, which shows that does get through to most people, but I think it should move two spaces up on the list.",9
"A must watch from start to finish this movie has you glued to your seat and you actually care and hate some character's. if you like jail movies it is a great one and the acting is top notch . There are not many movies out there that can come close to the quality and excellence of this one from the story to the backgrounds and all the little details . Do your self a service and go and watch it I am sure you wont regret the 3hr length (give or take). g how they were handling their publishing duties. Selected media members were allowed to play the title, the amount of players at once was cut in half near release, and review copies were shipped out just in time for the release of the physical copies of the game. All of this is just speculation on the quality of the title, but after playing Borderlands 2, it makes sense. Even with the Ce-shaded art style being very flattering for weaker hardware, the game still had serious issues that could not be patched up in time for release. The frame rate is almost always below 30fps, and rarely ever stabilizes unless you were to go to a vacant area and just stand there. Sometimes, the game cannot process everything happening on the screen, and the entire game freezes for around 1-2 seconds. The hardware cannot keep up with the action at many points, and this leaves the player frozen, confused, and even sometimes dead. There are numerous cheap deaths in Borderlands 2 due to the lack of hardware power. Although it is clear that the game has many issues resulting from the port job, it is also clear that the developer legitimately tried at this daunting task. Sometimes when it comes to ports, the actual problems stem from the studio that is given the job",10
"a best film of WB company ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time,

patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps,

but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story,

which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.",10
"This masterpiece, directed by Frank Darabout, explores two men seeking redemption as they dream of freedom in Shawshank prison. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover; he also befriends a convict named Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) as he eventually gains the respect of the other inmates. Roger Deakins' cinematography has the ability to capture Andy's sense of determination and optimism in Shawshank prison. This unforgettable drama deeply explores the essence of hope as the audience learns that ""some birds are not meant to be caged; their feathers are just too bright.""",10
"This is a good movie, but I'm surprised to see that it's got the #1 spot on IMDb's top movie list. The acting is excellent, and it has a great message; however, it's lacking a big ""wow"" moment for me. A lot of things that happened weren't necessarily ""predictable"", but I also wasn't shocked either. Still, it's a good movie that everyone should see.",10
"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Shawshank"" as I'm sure it's said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from one hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. ""Now Andy this"" and ""Andy that"". Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries ""Shawshank this"" and ""Shawhank that"" his gospel just never lets up.

Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who ""looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over"" a ""tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass"". But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.

Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.

The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialog was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.

In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!",10
"the main effect used in the movie is that the inside story is kept preserved for most of the time in the movie and revealed suddenly at the last movement . this was a great journey. the story narration of the movie is perfect.the direction of the movie from starting to the last is very much appreciated

this movie also teaches us that whatever be the way we have to struggle continuously in our life. and one day we will o=purely get success.

as a whole it was a very good movie and this type of movie should be appreciated. may be it does not have a very true story but this movie proves that only script does not matters",10
"I first saw this movie on TV and quickly it captured me somehow. The next day I searched the entire city for a shop to buy this movie and watch it on DVD. I must say, when I watched it first, I felt like... this has to be the best movies of all times. I think I cam compare it with Schindler's list but somehow this is better. Now let's talk about the movie. This is movie is really dramatic in a way, but it motivates you somehow, the main character gives you that power to live more better your days, when you see him struggling in that crazy prison. As everyone, the main character needs a friend, to get over the worst thing in prison, and he gets Red (M. Freeman) who remains his buddy until the end. The movie also show us how a prisoner gets so used to the prison life, that after he can get out... he doesn't know what to do with his life anymore. After you see Shawshank Prison, you are thinking about life in another perspective... and after that, you fell like seeing this movie again... and again! Great movie, and 10 stars from me, maybe the only one with this grade.",10
"This movie was easily the best one based on a Stephen King and Frank Darabont screenplay. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman act very well together as best friends who find a way to deal with their difficult circumstances. Morgan Freeman's name in the movie is Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. He is a person who can get you things, for a profit. Tim Robbins' name in the movie is Andrew Dufresne. He is someone accused of killing his wife. Andy asks Red to get him such items as a small rock hammer and posters of famous starlets. Red is someone disillusioned by the racist prison system, and serves as the main narrator for the film. This places the audience deeply inside the minds of the protagonists and even of the villains. I thought that Frank Darabont's directing was excellent. While close to three hours, it is time well spent as the movie is well written, well cast, and well directed. A solid 10/10 and recommended purchase.",6
"Personally this film is listed in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and that is a pretty hard list to get in to. The Director did a marvelous job with this film, the cinematography is amazing, along with a talented cast it's a hard one to beat (well Green Mile does but that's another review)I have read the negative comments and all I can say to that is (as a film maker myself)well is that not the magic of cinema? Nothing created for the cinema as fiction is ever real to life or it wouldn't be called a movie but a documentary but that's my opinion.

I think the story is both captivating and well told on the screen and it doesn't get the credit it deserves.",10
"I don't want to say anything about the movie. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I did. There are a lot of movies showing prison breaks but by far this one is the best not by the idea of the escape but by the message that this movie is sending. Once you've seen it you will feel different. I did

If you like Prison Break, if you liked Escape from Alcatraz you definitely want to see this movie.

Tim Robbins is doing an extraodrinary job and the screenplay is awesome. For sure 2 hours well spent in my life. And not only one ;)

If you can grab the 2004 release. Almost every error and goofs were fixed so you'll get the better version of it !",10
"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",9
"Wonderful, wonderful movie. It starts from a convict hoping for something and it beautifully shows the whole journey fulfilling the hope. Not for a moment I thought, I was watching a movie, it felt like living each moment. The plot summary says story of 2 prisoners, but I was moved by third one story. And the ending it was a sheer surprise, I was stunned to say the least. Must watch for anyone who hopes for something.",10
"This is a decent film. I do think it is way too over rated over the years though. In fact it is probably the most over rated movie in cinema history. There are several prison films that are far better. This is worth a watch and of course you may feel I've not been very kind once you have watched it. The two main characters are played by powerful actors in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, They are worth watching alone. The direction and overall portrayal of the film however in my opinion is rather predicable.",9
"Really, really fantastic movie, not overrated at all, by any means.

I watched it again recently, having seen it I think twice before, and even though I knew what was coming, the film still had me gripped and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I was also in tears at the end, it got me.

It's *almost* a perfect movie.

I say almost because the third act loses pace a little bit but the opening two acts are superb and the final act is one of the greatest endings of anything put to film.

Acting: completely flawless, Freeman is outstanding, but as are all the supporting cast, from Prison Governor to Warden to even the small parts of the film, everybody performed Tone: on point, mostly realistic (the lack of ageing from the characters supposed to be over 20 years can be forgiven because the film is so good, and it was the 90s where there wasn't CGI and budget available like there is nowadays) Direction and cinematography: lovely

In context, it deserves a 10 due to.all things considered: it wasn't a big budget movie, okay it had a budget but we're not talking hundreds of millions, so small details can be forgiven, but from the human element it's a wonderfully well-judged movie with heart, the film at no point becomes boring, beautifully directed and acted, an outstanding piece of cinema that will live forever.

It's no surprise that so many people love this film, it's not trying to be anything that it isn't, it isn't asking permission for anything, it does what it does with complete integrity. No special effects, just a human story which everybody can relate to. 10/10.",5
"I'd be lying to you if I told you that when Andy brakes out of his cell and crawls to freedom, I wasn't just as happy as the masses of people that call this their all time favorite move. And to say that I wasn't riveted when he is locked i the office and turns up the music while being threatened by the guards would also be untrue. But at the same time, this movie is most certainly not the second best film ever because of one simple reason: It can't decide if it wants to be real with occasional hints of hope or imaginative and dreamy. It drags you along for two hours of hard depressing facts and victory only in the most modest portions, then, for whatever reason, has a Hollywood ending of him digging through the wall then picking up the bank account that there's no way in hell that he'd be able to get in real life. This is great entertainment and I give it a ton of credit for having the ability to maintain my attention the whole time. But at the same time, the ending proved a little disappointing because it betrayed everything that this movie was trying to be.",10
"This film has moved me in was I struggle to describe. From the style of filming to the script and actors, it is all phenomenal and culminates in what I consider to be the greatest piece of cinema I have ever seen. This is pure and absolute storytelling. It simultaneously shocking, heartwarming, brutal and meaningful. But most of all the story is hopeful in a way that I have never experienced.",10
"The Villain in this movie played by Bob Gunton inst just the Villain because hes the warden and the protagonist is an inmate, but because of his despicable actions that make him one of the greatest villains in all of cinematic history. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances as Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd Redding respectively. Time in this movie is portrayed expertly by Morgan freeman's character getting parole every 10 years and the tired expression on his face just shows. frank darabont's direction goes a hell of a long way with the direction of brooks character played marvelously by James Whitmore shows what time and captivity can do to a man it's very unsettling to think about. the scenes with Andy and the sisters and the one where Andy is in the hole just feel so real. this is one of the best movies ever made and also a personal favorite of mine.",9
"Really a brain twister movie to watch. Morgen Freeman on his best along with Tim Robbins. Once you start watching you can not move on before ending it just because of its mysterious story which you will loved the most. I think one of best movie ever directed by Frank Darabont.And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.",9
"There's not many movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them. It just feels pitch perfect. Well written, perfectly casted ... the cinematography is flawless. By far, Darabont's crown jewel. Everything just works so well. And Morgan Freeman's (now ubiquitous) narration is the heart and soul of the film. A dark but uplifting tale about hope and friendship. A timeless, Hollywood masterpiece.

I sometimes wonder if films like this will ever be made again? Would it even be possible for a movie like this to be greenlit today and compete with Fast & Furious 23? Probably not. If you haven't seen this movie, waste no time, find it and watch it.",10
It's a cult movie and this movie has a cool name. This film tells the road to success despite difficulties. I think it's one of the movies to watch.,10
"Really now. I can't say that this is the worst movie of all time, but it certainly isn't the greatest. The mere fact that TBS plays this movie sixteen times per week, thereby forcing you to watch it over and over again, does not mean that it is good. I therefore, call for a ""surge"" of negative reviews to be leveled against this mediocre film so that with the help of Mark Twain and his angels we will be able to oust it from its ill-deserved spot as IMDb #1 movie of all time. Honestly, my fellow Americans, this film is the kind of thing that makes us look bad.

Merry Christmas, and to all a good night.",10
"I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet, because you shouldn't be wasting your time reading reviews when you can be watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" instead.

This is the best film of all time. Where do I even begin? The foreshadowing, the charm, Morgan Freeman, the emotion, the characters, Morgan Freeman. the music, the rewatchability, did I mention Morgan Freeman?

There's a reason why this film is ranked #1 of all time on IMDb. I don't want to waste any more time. Just watch it!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption redefines what a cinematic experience can be. Delivered with humility, honesty, and powerful performances, it weaves a captivating tale about freedom and hope that leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of viewers. Released in 1994, it may not have lit the box office on fire, but its flame continues to burn in the heart of cinema lovers.

The movie, adapted from Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", pulls you into the bleak walls of Shawshank State Penitentiary. It follows the story of a banker, Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, who is wrongfully accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and receives a double life sentence. As he navigates the brutal reality of prison life, his friendship with Ellis 'Red' Redding, a long-term inmate, portrayed by Morgan Freeman, takes center stage. This friendship and their shared dreams of freedom form the crux of the plot.

The movie presents an array of brilliantly portrayed characters and themes, with each element skillfully contributing to the story's overall grandeur. Andy's unwavering hope and resilience against the brutal backdrop of Shawshank and Red's skepticism, which slowly transforms into belief, create a perfect on-screen balance. A curious trivia: The role of Tommy Williams, eloquently brought to life by the young Gil Bellows, was initially offered to Brad Pitt. He, however, had to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts.

The Shawshank Redemption showcases cinematic storytelling at its finest. Director Frank Darabont uses the camera to immerse us fully into the harsh environment of the prison, while Thomas Newman's score brings a distinctively emotive layer to the narrative. Not to mention, the film is interspersed with witty dialogues and philosophical insights, that further enrich the viewing experience. The famous dialogue, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"", remains one of the most quoted lines in movie history.

On the critical front, The Shawshank Redemption does not falter. Its depiction of prison life is unflinchingly real yet avoids excessive pessimism. The plot does not rush but allows the characters and their relationships to evolve naturally. While some may argue that the movie's ending is overly optimistic, others would say that it perfectly encapsulates the film's prevailing theme of hope and redemption. An interesting note: while the movie ends on a different note from the novella, Stephen King has publicly stated that he prefers the film's ending.

In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is more than a movie; it's an experience, a life lesson wrapped in the garb of a prison drama. It delivers a powerful message about friendship, hope, and perseverance that resonates long after the end credits roll. Watching Andy and Red carve their path towards redemption is like witnessing a silent rebellion against fate. Despite being set within the confines of a grim penitentiary, it leaves you with an unconfined sense of freedom and an urge to embrace life with renewed vigor. As Red states in the movie, ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"". Indeed, The Shawshank Redemption is one such good thing, a cinematic masterpiece, that refuses to fade away.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is just an epic masterpiece. It's a movie everybody should watch once in their life. Frank Darabont put together a legendary film, which at the time he probably did not think it would ever get this big. Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Gill Bellows, Tim Robbins, and the rest of the amazing cast gave their performances of their life's to make this movie such an exceptional one. Looking back at the 1994 Oscars, in my opinion i think it should have won Best Picture over Forest Gump. Honestly, i don't think there is a single flaw in this movie. Its one of the most iconic films ever made. Thomas Newman as well, did great in composing the score for the movie.",9

It dont matter how many times i watch and i still feel like its the first time im watching :) just great! I think most of you knows what i mean by that. Great by means,9
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that the majority of people will love, and yet, it can be hard to pinpoint one particular reason why. The performances are stellar, in fact it's hard to think of any particular cast member who lets the team down, but that's not it. The set design is suitably bleak, the dialogue is just the right balance of realism and poetry, and we once again get to hear the dulcet tones of Morgan Freeman's narration, but again, these are not what make the film great.

Everything comes together with Shawshank, creating an instant and intense atmosphere that can be gritty, distressing, and at the same time, hopeful, humorous and beautiful. This film portrays the character's life and experience with frank honesty, with the undeniable quality of the production only serving to support this incredible story. Even the score is impressive, adding tension even when you don't even notice it's there.

The only reason I don't give this film a ten is because it is not usually a genre that I love, and although this film is definitely an exception, I cannot say it is outright perfect. But it's damn near close!",10
We're now in 2020 and I still consider this movie one of the best I have ever seen. I watch it every couple of years or so and it always amazes me. I can now say it's an excellent classic. Pretty much every review here says it all. Brilliant I'm every level.,10
"Anyone who has ever read any Stephen King knows that a good 98% of the time the movie is never as good as the book. Usually the movie loses so much of the characters from the books. I actually didn't read the story the movie is based on (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption)until years after seeing the movie a few hundred times. That's why, when I read it for the first time I was very surprised to find myself saying ""wow, the movie actually followed the book!!"" to the point that, in an odd coincidence, the movie was on AMC when I was in the last few pages of the story and I held off onreading the last part, Reds talk about Hope, until it came up in the movie. And, as I was reading, even though the book told us Red was in fact a white, red headed Irish man, I heard Mr. Freeman telling me the whole story as I read it.",10
"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....

I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world- class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.

But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.

"At first I thought I would be bored by the Shawshank Redemption but when the film was over I was the complete opposite. The story was gripping, sad, and at some points even funny. The acting was perfect. If they had picked different actors I think they wouldn't have been able to pull it ...The Shawshank Redemption has three dimensional characters, great character development, acting, script, editing, twists, camera angles, directing, music and more. As always Morgan Freeman was awesome....Must watch movie.....Hello Friends,I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

"It is a classic movie of Morgan Freeman, based on a escape from a prison, the making was outstanding, last 15 minutes of the film just made my mind delighted, one must watch the movie till the end.",10
"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10. Simple the best movie ever.",10
"Frank Darabont 's 'The Shawshank Redemption' is an excellent piece of Art, that takes the viewers for a philosophical ride. This Prison film, focuses on the journey of a banker (Tim Robbins) in Shawshank prison, through the eyes of another inmate 'RED', played by Morgan Freeman. Though the film, haven't succeed in box office terms, The shawshank redemption, will remain a Timeless Epic.

Thank You !!",10
"Without a doubt this movie is very good and intense. Furthermore, the acting is great. However, the whole plot and the story is the same, identical to (the great director) Bresson's movie "" Un condamné à mort s'est échappé/ Le vent souffle où il veut"", that he made in 1956! The scenario is exactly the same. So, it is a good thing to give high score to ""Shawshank redemption"" , but let's also watch the original one, the movie that Derabont took the idea and got inspired to make his movie. I hope that, many people have understood that and already appreciate Bresson's movie. Let's watch some real cinema!",9
This film has to be watched by everyone . It's just superb. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor. The story is good and the acting is the best I've ever seen. It's a long film but trust me you will not regret watching this film. It's a shame they never made a follow-up of this movie. This movie will still be on TV many many years from now.,10
"The after effects of this movie will affect your mood for sometime for sure. Its the most heart touching movie I have ever seen in my life. At first it didn't seem like the best movie in the world as everyone talking about but I don't know when but at some point you will forget about everything and start to melt in to this movie. This is unbelievably deep, no movie has ever came to that depth. Its unimaginable levels of sadness you could feel for yourself. Its scary too in a way especially when you realize this happens in the real world for lots of people.",9
"The shawshank redemption isn't just a movie. It's THE movie. If aliens came to earth and wanted to watch a movie, I'd show them this. Everyone should see this once in their life. A must watch. No movie made me cry so naturally like this one, it's beautiful. Watch it now.",10
"One of the finest films ever made. This jockeys for 1st or 2nd in my all time list, depending on when I'm asked. This movie is a thoughtful, poignant and brutally honest examination of the human experience in the face of extreme adversity.

The overall theme boils down to ""Don't give up hope"" and that the evidence of that hope is the focusing of one's will into a sheer, unstoppable weapon for change. Andy is a wonderfully rounded out and active protagonist who you root for even before you know him well.

This movie has been played repeatedly on cable, but do yourself a favor and watch the unedited version. Bring tissue in case dirt gets in your eye.",10
"Movie is really good but I don't think, it is the no 1 top rated movie...",9
"In 2017 I watched this movie. I enjoyed every moment from the beginning to the end. Nowadays movies rely on effects more than stories and maybe very old movies depend on stories more. However, 90s movies have very good story and still with attractive effects. Unfortunately this movie wasn't successful in box offices, it deserves more credits.",10
"Great movie, great cinematography, great acting. I really enjoyed this.",10
"This is a Film I try to watch atleast a few times a year, it is impact full and gripping, the story line was well written. Definately a Recommended film",10
"So many clichés spawned from this film as did Freeman's own ""Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman"" style of acting. That being said it's hard to watch it and not feel joy at the little victories the cons manage to win. Tops the list of best films again and again but you can see why if you're looking for a man's chick flick.",10
Pretty good actually. I liked the Movie as a whole but cannot give it higher due to the fact I've seen better Movies in the past.,9
"This movie really displays how horrible life in prison was in the 1900s.The guards, the warden, the facility itself. It just feels so real and almost scary for the watcher.

I gave this movie a 9/10 because I found that it captured almost everything I find important in a movie. I also just love everything from Stephen King and this truly is, his masterpiece.

You really get pulled into the story as it goes on and understand the thoughts and feelings of the main character.

Brilliant actors, a great director and of course the man to thank it all for, Stephen King.",9
The shawshank redemption is a wonderful film adaptation that is far superior than its original story. With great writing and a fantastic story as well as some of the best acting you will see in film.,10
"Hope can be dangerous. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.I hope. If I tell someone my favorite movie is it, everyone understands I am movie buff.",10
"The movie is pure class and sends a great massage. No matter what happens in your life, you shouldn't lose hope.",10
It's a movie not to be missed and indeed everyone in the movie plays thier roll very well,10
Nice Really nice one contribution Nice Really nice one contribution,10
I don't get why this movie is so beloved... Seemed very cliche and predictable. Maybe it's a 90's thing?,10
I love this movie so much. I think I've seen it around 5 times now and I love it every time. There is nothing bad I can really say about it. Even though they don't follow the book to its core I still think it really deserves its number one place here.,9
"WOW what a great way to spend two hours on your backside - This is one of the greatest films ever made. I love all of it, Tim Robbins acting fighting the skinheads, teaching the inmates, helping with the guards finances, and digging the tunnel a wonderfully written part and a self crafted bit genius from Morgan Freeman made this film sparkle! GREAT FILM! please watch it... I think the prison warden looks like Graham 'turinp' Taylor the ex England Soccer Manager! funny - I love the shoes joke at the end very good. It did remind me a little of other films when Morgan Freeman leaves prison. But Tim on his boat at the very end is a smile raiser!",9
When I was 1st told about this film was about 20 odd year's ago I was so gripped by it that I just went out and bought it stopped buying dvd's age's ago but I have this film in my collection,10
Probably the best movie ever made. Period. Pure perfection.,9
I Really Really Loved it And it contain 1 of the best metaphors ive ever watched,10
"Look I don't write reviews but I'm just speechless right now... One of the greatest movie I have ever seen and if you haven't watched it, you should and you won't regret it, The reviews don't lie and the high rating is well deserved.",10
I've seen this movie over 10 times now and it only gets better and deeper! Thank you Frank.D and Mr. King for creating this wonderful story and movie! Best of all time,10
Best movie ever. Awesome actors playing. This more than two hours been gone like 10 minets.,10
I have seen this move more then 20 times and every time i see this movie it's seems new to me. The Main story told in this move is more than perfect to motivate any one for keep focusing on Goal what you want to achieve .,10
"Everything is perfect. Acting, screenplay, directing. Stephen King is a hell of a writer despite awfull movies like The Langoliers, The Tommyknockers and IT (1990), the books from which those movies were adapted are awesome, so either you do a great movie out of a Stephen King story or a really terrible one.",10
"Based on Stephen kings 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' this movie is a modern masterpiece that I could not recommend more, upon watching it just once it has instantly become one of my favourites. Touching and heartbreaking at times, yet at others disturbing. A grim look on the lives of the prisoners. The characters leave you attached to their individual personalities each creating a sense of sympathy from the viewer. Characters such as Brooks, an old man who looks after a wounded bird within the prison, truly shine and their individual stories leave you feeling as they feel. Brilliantly directed with touching themes such as hope, friendship and humanity within prisons makes this film truly worth the hype. Could not reccomend more. Closest thing to cinematic perfection and story telling that I have come across.",2
I remember this. I just forgot about the whole thing. I watched last night and forgot how good this movie was. Well done!,10
"When I watched this film at first time, I focused very much. Screenplay is very fluent and well-designed. The most significant point for this film, in my opinion related to actors or characters as Andy Dufrense and Red. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played very convincing. I know leading role was offered Tom Hanks. But I am very satisfied Tim Robbins played this good role. On the other hand this film didn't have any awards as Academy and Golden Globe. This fact trouble me. I think the most splendid episode in this film: when guards call the roll in the morning everybody exits their rooms expect Andy and most of people suppose that (as me) he committed suicide but he left. All in all nobody can deny that the biggest success was off the director of film Frank Darabont.",10
"Very few movies can move moods so subtly and then surprise you at the end, but this one did that for me.

A skillfully evocative piece that shows the rewards of morality and undying faith.",10
"Its interesting to read the comments on this movie. I don't think any film has polarized users as much as this one has. Almost 53% gave it a 10! 10 is perfection in cinematography, acting, screenplay etc. This movie is not perfect. Granted it tells a heartwarming story and is entertaining enough, so I charitably gave it an 8 and I think that's fair. Is this movie the second best of all time? NOT! I think 53% of the voters have been blinded by the redemption scene and the twist at the end, sure it was neat but check your warm n' fuzzies folks. Other movies that are overrated at IMDb because of a neat twist at the end are The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense. A twist does not make it Perfect.",10
"The amount of time that has past since I last saw a movie as interesting and faithful to the making of film has been more than I can remember. After that extensive wait, my thirst for a film as engrossing as The Shawshank Redemption grew to the point where it did not even register anymore. This film though, has broken the wall of disinterest I've held for cheesy, hi-tech, flashy cute flicks that have littered the cinemas as of late. The character development, cinematography, and script for The Shawshank Redemption shine through the bleak cloud that I see surrounding Hollywood these days, as it concerns itself with special effects and big name actors bent on budgets and wages. A rental that I so wish I had seen in the theaters five years ago, the camera work and display from Freeman and Robbins is a relief to view, and eye-opening connection to movies that is so rare. It's one film that tugs at all your emotional strings, and even plucks at the brain a little.",10
One of the best movies that I have watched till date. The best part of the movie is it's simplicity. The depth of the movie is narrated in a simple way without any superficial open endings and confusions.,10
What a nice movie i watched. Highly recommend this movie for everybody.,9
"Shawshank Redemption is - no doubt- one of the best films I've ever watched. Not only the quality of the performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins but also the most amazing and interesting screenplay makes film worth watching. The film surpasses Papillon(Butterfly) - one of the best jail-escape film ever shot - in many aspects. Dustin Hoffman and Steve Mcqueen are both fine actors with a couple of Oscar Nominations but Morgan freeman is surely the real suit for the role. Tim Robbins amazes the audience with his cold-blooded behaviours from the very beginning till the end of the film. If you haven't watched the film yet, it's the one you should borrow at first chance.",10
"I can see it again and again, this is without a doubt the best movie ever made! I love everything about it, and if you have'nt seen it yet, I must urge you to run to the nearest video store and get yourself a copy. I'll bet you'll love it!",10
Classic storytelling stellar cast a timeless piece of cinema that can be enjoyed and relate to a number of demographics the takeaway message of reaching for the humanity within each of us from our most basic needs while regarding the will to live is strong,10
"i love love love love love this movie! I dont know how many movies i can say that i've walked away from feeling completely overcome with happiness and satisfaction, but i know this is one of them. this is one of my favorite movies! i can't remember the last movie that i cried with happiness at the end. ""Different Seasons"" is a great collection of King stories, and two of his best movie adaptations have been taken from it: shawshank and ""Stand by Me."" i thought it was nice to see a movie that relied on something other than sex and violence, and makes the viewer feel so wonderful afterwards! a must must must see!",10
"I must say I'm very surprised at all of these positive comments. I'm shocked at the #2 rating. Simply because very few people I know have seen the film. When I run into the ones who have, we end up discussing it for a long time. That's the power this movie has.

I have no reason to connect to the characters. I'm simply a young woman and nothing more. I've never been unjustly accused of a crime and/or thrown into prison. Yet somehow this alien situation becomes much larger and universal. You connect no matter what your circumstance is.

The only disappointment I had was that I didn't get the chance to see the film in the theaters. I avoided renting it because I thought it would be boring. Please do not let that sway you. This is one of the most exciting movies I have ever seen. It's my favorite movie.",10
"i have to say that i had to be coerced into seeing it. my cousin told me the title and that totally turned me off. but after finally seeing this masterpiece i could have shot myself for thinking the way that i did. this film quickly became my alltime favorite. when people had asked me before what my favorite movie is, i had a few. but now it is hands down my favorite. i could watch it 10 times a day and still want to watch it one more time. even though i'm only 16 i know a good movie when i see one. i am so disappointed in the academy for not giving it any awards. but then again they also didn't give jim carrey a nomination for the truman show. so anyone out there wants to see it, do.",10
This is my boyfriend best movie ever and he showed it to me recently and I loved it ! It's beautiful and surprising !,10
"Without a doubt, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the absolute best movies that I have ever seen. Seeing a movie with characters that seem so true to life that I could actually care for them was a rare and very welcome experience for me. The film was made in such a way that you didn't really know how it was going to end, but what an ending indeed. I thought it was one of the most rewarding endings to a movie in recent history. I don't know how this movie was passed up for an Academy Award for best picture, or at least a nomination, amazes me. Well deserving of its rank of #4 in the top 250 movies of all time.",10
"Nice film, all of this comment its just needed to activate my account i guess.",10
"Although this movie is almost 16years old, it still can holp up with new movies coming up nowadays. Fantastic movie!",10
I really liked this movie. It had everything i needed. I can fully understand why this is the #1 movie on imdb.,10
"I've never imagined movie with such great depth, this one moved me!

I think this must be some serious piece of film making in a long time. At some point of the film, I even felt like I'm a part of the movie. (I laughed with Andy and his pals at their lunch when they are talking about a 'new fish'. Wait a minute, I'm a prisoner!?)

So when you're in the midst of hopelessness, this would be your life jacket.

Cheers! (At the rooftop)",10
"This movie is truly my favorite film of all time. It certainly should have won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1994. Unfortunately, Forrest Gump and Tom Hanks were out and about that year as well, so Shawshank took a back seat. It never should have. This is the most well-acted, scripted, directed and filmed movie I have seen to date. From the narration to the awe-inspiring ending, this movie is, quite simply, perfect. I've not been able to say that about another movie before or since.",10
"In my opinion, this is the best adaptation of a Stephen King work ever done. It is totally involving from start to finish, and has one of the most satisfying conclusions I've ever seen. It is one of those intriguing films which cause you to work backward in your mind from the climax to figure out how it all happened.",9
"There are few movies that are never forgotten. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, that always stays in the back of the mind. Andy Dufresne is a character that the viewer finds themselves caring about from his first appearance. Everyone knows a Red or a Brooks. The triumph of the human spirit comes out. When the movie ends, it leaves you with a sense that you just endured a great journey. There are few films that actually allow the viewer to feel as if the actions happening to the main actor, are happening to them.",10
"Owo. i jus love this movie. when he do the stunt , i was jus shocked!!!",10
Incredible. That's all there is to say about it. Tim Robbin's turns in a fantastic performance as does Morgan Freeman and all of the supporting cast. The story is captivating and the characters are well drawn. All screen writers (aspiring as well as established) need to review this movie periodically to remember why they love movies. Movie scores do not get any better than in Shawshank.,9
This film is by far my favorite movie to date. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry. Once you watch this movie a second time you see how all the small details that you may have seen as insignificant fall into place. My personal favorite is how the rock hammer was in the starting pages of the book of Exodus from the bible.,10
"I first saw this movie on TBS one night, and wasn't all that interested in it at first. But as the movie progressed, I found myself totally glued to the TV. This movie is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. Every single thing in this movie is perfect, the acting, chemistry, plot. Its all so wonderfully done. The ending of this movie was really great. Its really hard to describe how good this movie is. Just go get it, you'll never regret seeing it.",10
"This is a 'must see' movie. Very strong emotionally and with great actors that perform at their best.

But this movie makes you think, think about life and specially about hope, and the final is well worth seeing it.

After all, isn't Shawshank our prison to us all?",10
"This is one of the best movies of all time; an absolute masterpiece! It brings me to tears every time I see it and I never tire of it. It is a shame that this movie came out in 1994 because Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump stole it's thunder. Had it been released in '95, '96, '98, or '99. It surely would have been a front runner the best picture oscar. I exclude '97 because nothing could have beat the almighty Titanic. Everyone should see this movie because it is the best example of good people triumphing over evil and that hope still exists. The ending will put you in a good mood, I guarantee it!",10
"This movie is simply amazing. The acting is superb, especially from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the direction is one of kind and the ending sequence is so touching that you will cry.

This film should have get more attention. Can't understand why it didn't...",1
"Any movie that you can see over 30 times and doesn't get old, doesn't become prone to having mistakes found in it and still keeps you anticipating the ending even though you know what's going to happen is a great movie. Flawless is the only word I can use to describe this movie. From the acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to the screen play by Stephen King, this film doesn't have one flaw in it. This film has one of the all time best endings if not the best ending I've ever seen. A definite master piece of a movie.",10
"Brilliance. Total Brilliance.

From the perfectly casted roles, to the haunting music; the all-encompassing narrative provided by Morgan Freeman, to the magnificent storyline and plot, this movie blends all these elements of good film-making. So much so, that even something as commonly overlooked as having just enough comedy to provide relief from total somberness, but not enough to distract from the misery of prison life brought by the equally criminal actions of those in authority at the prison; this, too, was executed with perfection.

This movie is the blueprint for what I would consider to be the perfect movie. I challenge anyone to come up with something they would ""do better"" than what those who made this movie did.",10
"The best film I've ever seen. As soon as I got a DVD player I made sure this was among my first purchases. I watched it 3 times that week and a several more times in the following few months. If you haven't seen this film yet, rent it today. Better yet, buy it, because you'll definitely want to see it more than once!",9
"This move is by far one of the best movies of all time. It deserves to be in the top 5. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do an excellent job, I couldn't pick anyone else to play the role better. Their performance was outstanding. I recommend this movie to everyone, if you haven't seen it, you should.",10
"There are so many facets to this film, both subtle and obvious. You really need to see it multiple times to appreciate them all. Several reviews have tried to boil this movie down into a few phrases, usually not doing it justice. This movie is about the growing and intimate friendship of the two main characters, and is possibly the best male friendship movie ever made.

If only Steven King would stick to movies like this and Stand By Me, instead of the supernatural horror films. His story-telling prowess is unmatched.

Morgan Freeman once again shows his incredible abilities, and this performance ranks with his great portrayal in Glory! He has an uncanny knack for helping you know a character better than it's screentime should allow. You just know who Red is in this film, in your heart.

HBO's showing several years ago included a couple of cut-out scenes that were fantastic, and are worth looking for if you like this movie.",10
"After being slightly dissappointed by ""The Green Mile"", I decided to check out Frank Darabont's first adaptation of a Steven King prison story once again. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remained as much of an enjoyably original modern classic after this second viewing. In this second viewing, I appreciated even more the sparklingly sharp dialogue between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Like in ""Green Mile"", Darabont set the scene of a depression-era prison extremely well. The director was also well-served to use King's vivid character descriptions to make the supporting characters as memorable as the leads. The result was an instant, uplifting classic about hope brought to the most hopeless locations.",10
Everyone should watch this movie at least once. Amazing cast direction..I love Mr. Freeman.,6
The Shawshank Redemption was a beautifully directed movie. The actors portrayed their characters to the greatest extent and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The best scene in the movie was the huge tree...each of its branches catching the suns rays as Morgan Freeman finds what Tim Robbins left for him...anyone who doesn't remember that better watch the movie again.,1
"Shawshank Redemption is one of my personal all time favorite films because of the dialogue, the detail, the acting, the emotion given off by the actors in each scene and all around the whole movie itself makes it a legend. The cast is perfect especially each role each actor and actress portrays is spot on and makes you shiver how well they are in their roles. I believe that all parents should have their kids watch this movie at least once in their young lives so they can see a true masterpiece at it's finest. Every part of the movie is breath-taking, amazing and just beautiful in its own way. There is not one thing I can complain about with this movie and you shouldn't either because it is just pure perfection in movie history. Best Movie I have watched in my whole life, nothing can beat it in my opinion.",10
I think this movie is my favorite of all time. The reasons are (1)I watch it every time it is played on television in rerun even though I have it on tape (2)It gets an emotional reaction from me every time I watch it and (3)I never notice how long the movie is because I am so entertained by it.,10
"I watched Shawshank right after it's release on VHS and was completely overtaken by it. I went out and bought the video as soon as I could and to this day it remains the gem of my collection. It is simply the greatest movie ever made. No matter how many times I watch this film, it seems to get even better than the last. There isn't a single flaw anywhere in this movie! The greatest aspect though is Morgan Freemans narration. Nobody should go without seeing this movie at least once.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the best film i have ever seen. The story by itself is just awesome, and the actors in this film are really superb It is not right that the godfather stands before this film.

Shawshank Redemption should be at first place!!!!",10
One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie.,10
The Greatest Movie ever made by human beings. Don't know about Aliens though,10
A great movie that is now a classic. definitely in my top 10. some of the best characters and best character development i've ever seen in a movie.,9
"I'm not usually reviewing movies in here, but the ratings on imdb were the first thing that made me wonder ""what's so good about this movie"" and so they've piqued my interest in it. And no doubt it worth every second watching this masterpiece.

The easiest way to describe it without spoiling anything is: just think that I'm not into this kind of ""normal life"" type of movies, since I find them pretty boring. But this one is on a different level. I can't believe that a non science-fiction movie has surpassed all the other movies I've ever watched with its glorious plot.

I'll definitely recommend it to anyone I have the opportunity to.",10
"I'm not going to say anything new that anyone has already done. But I can say what I do thing about the movie. Simply put it is a way to make you aware how special as a human beings we are in terms of belonging to something.

I am not such a fan of Morgan Freeman but I can freely admit that this movie made me see him really different in a really good way.

If you really want to see something different that it will make you learn a few lessons about human emotions, and the difference between being right or wrong (Not going much further in of course), this is indeed your movie.",10
"I have seen this movie like a thousand times, and I enjoyed it every single time, because every single time watching it, I remarked new anecdotes that I hadn't in the previous watching. Morgan Freeman is definitely on his best performance ever,(I just love the part where he sits in front of the rehabilitation committee for the last time and tells them how it feels to be in prison for more than 20 years), and Frank Darabont can surely be proud of directing an intelligent movie, but Tim Robbins deserves to be mentioned due to an excellent performance as well as all the other actors. I appreciate the way in which this movie combines two crucial topics of every life: Hope and disillusion ! And I guess I also liked it because there aren't any women in the movie! No offence!",10
"Any time this is on cable and there's nothing on but B.S. won't mention AMC time theif programs, I watch this regardless how many times I have seen it already!!!",10
"The story is amazingly written, acting is perfect. Everything about the movie is well made. A Must watch to anyone who likes movies one bit.",10
"Fear can hold you prisoner. hope can set you free. a strong man can save himself. a great man can save another. You know some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are just too bright.",10
"Many folk rate Shawshank Redemption as one of the best films they have ever seen. I'm not so impressed. Firstly, I agree that the absence of special effects is a boon in any 1990s film. Secondly, Freeman and Robbins act well and are well-directed. The storyline, though, lacks subtlety (not in the telling - this is a very well directed film - but as a story) and Dufesne comes over as a kind of everything-he-touches, incarcerated upper-middle class Forrest Gump. The film is suffused with a kind of Manichean morality which tips over too readily into sentimentality (again, despite the best efforts of Freeman and Robbins) and which, ultimately, I found cloying.

Perhaps, though, I'm being too harsh. Is it just that the film is a lot better than the story from which it is taken? Rita Hayworth: eat your heart out?",9
This is one of the best movies of all times as it has got everything in it for a person to enjoy a good movie and learn from it. I advise everyone to watch it at least once.,8
"I watched this film for the fist time recently and I am in awe, it certainly lives up to praise it get's. It's rare for me to enjoy such a highly rated film as i usually set my standards to high, but you can't set your standards high enough for this masterpiece.",10
"This film is one of the best films I've ever seen. It gives you a realistic story line of how the prison system works. My friends first Persuaded me to watch it, while I thought it was going to be very boring, and now it is one of my favourite films. It makes you go on an emotional rollercoaster and the ending is so unpredictable. My friends and I still quote this movie and having seen it a hundred times we still all love it. It is a great film to watch with family and friends and is an all time classic to watch.",10
"Havent seen this movie, YOU NEED TO, Best movie of all time.",10
"A must see for a diehard fan of a great script. While watching this movie, remember to to bring all the snaks and drinks. Not a single minut can missed. Enjoy",9
So nice perfect how are u i hope u have a nice day,10
"I think there is no need for me come up with words of praise, 'cos they've already been said in comments before mine! But the interesting thing is that Shawshank Redemption never won any thing at the 1994 Academy Awards, least of all Best Picture. Look at the competition... Forrest Gump, Quiz Show, Pulp Fiction, and (for Heaven's Sake) 4 Weddings and a Funeral! If I do recall correctly, the buzz at that time was that the only *real* contenders were Pulp and Forrest. Shawshank never figured in the race. FYI, Forrest won it, and he's at #169 in the IMDb 250.

Anyway, my opinion is that every once in a long while, you get ordinary people who have had minimal success on their own, come together and make an almost perfect movie. This is it. I doubt that anyone of the people who made this film will ever be able to reach the heights they did with Shawshank. Some have tried, but failed (like the director -> Green Mile).

Embrace this film, and let it enrich your being.",10
"Anytime this movie is showing on any channel I must watch it- in fact, I've lost count of how many times I've watched this. What an amazing movie, that puts life into perspective. A true masterpiece that sits amongst the classics in my books.",9
"I love this movie,a lot it is by far the most emotionzl movie i've seen in my life.",10
Great movie. Great acting and storyline. Excellent plot twist,8
Best single movie ever to exist everyone should watch it before they die,10
An amazing movie that left me crying as I was leaving the movie theater.,10
If you haven't seen it - what are you waiting for??,10
"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. He is befriended by Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate and prison contraband smuggler serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Assigned to work in the prison laundry, Andy is frequently sexually assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.

In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen, a front to allow Andy to manage financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decaying library.

Brooks is paroled in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro; Andy plays an excerpt over the public address system and is punished with solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. Andy launders the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".

Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary in 1965. Andy and Red befriend him, and Andy helps him pass his GED exam. A year later, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but Norton refuses to listen, and when Andy mentions the money laundering, Norton sends him back to solitary confinement. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy attempts to discontinue the laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near Buxton, asking Red-once he is released-to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy's well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for 6 ft (1.8 m) of rope.

At the next day's roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the previous 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton's suit, shoes, and ledger, containing proof of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.

After serving 40 years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to Fort Hancock, Texas, and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach in Zihuatanejo, and the two reunited friends happily embrace.",10
This is that kind of film that every one will love. I have watched this film 5 times and will watch it again. This film gives you hope when you are lost. Nothing short of a masterpiece.,10
"One of the few movies that always makes me cry. I love the role of Freeman and the ending (without making a spoiler) is nice, for a change",10
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION at Metropolitan Ensemble Theatre At The Warwick Theatre. Nice Little review for our premier in Kansas of our stage adaptation. standing ovation every night so far I hear,9
"It goes without saying that Stephen King is the master of horror fiction. So many of his works have been adapted into films that star phenomenal actors. To date: I have seen The Shining, the new ITs, Shawshank Redemption. The Green Mile, and all three Carries.

I have yet to see The Stand and the original IT. I also haven't finished watching The Mist which is a television series based on his short story by the same name.

As far as books go however, I have read The Shining, Carrie, began IT (need to finish it), and On Writing. Clearly, I must read Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, and maybe Christine. Of course there's also Doctor Sleep (sequel to The Shining) which is already a movie and The Stand which I must read as well.

But I feel this review went from Stephen King to why I read and watch Stephen KIng films to basically nothing about Shawshank Redemption.

So let's get back on track here. The first review on I.M.D.B. for this movie is titled ""Tied for the best movie I have ever seen"". If I read the review, maybe I'll figure out WHY it's tied.

As for me though, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Nice bonus to have my name be mentioned: Andy Dufresne. But besides the name drop, this movie gave me a lot to think about. Stephen King/the writers really dove into the inner workings of a prison and with a stellar cast that includes Morgan Freeman, I was hooked. The prison break was even genius. I don't want to spoil too much and this film is not the best film I have ever seen, but it's up there.

Before watching the movie, I recommend reading the book (I still haven't. Guilty) and then comparing the two once you have seen Shawshank Redemption. I can't guarantee it, but I would assume you won't be disappointed.

With writes,

-Andy Ruffett",10
"It's very hard to find a movie that is as much inspiring as this one. Andy Dufresne really incarnates the values of perseverance, integrity and altruism; that's why he is one of my favorite movie characters of all time.

Some violent scenes may be too frightening to kids and younger teens. Besides that I think is a very aproppiate movie.",10
"This movies has everything you know about movies should be. A amazing storytelling, fantastic characters in movie.

Morgen Freeman and Tim Robinson is atruly unique actors.

A masterpiece of art to make into movies. I love everything from start to finish.",10
"Gripping, very good movie. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes.",10
Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and defintely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! Oh and it's better than the novel.,10
Idu Idu... Idu cinema andre. Sakath guru. Jail inda escape andre hinge...,10
"I watched this movie when I was young enough to understand movie ratings but not care enough. I don't know why, but I thought, this was going to be a caper, hiest movie. It was.. in parts. But, what got me and has stayed with me throughout a long time is how the human element rules. Seldom do you come across such fleshed out characters where even the smallest character has such a deep impact. In almost every department the film shines brilliantly and stands the test of time. Its self flagellating honesty to the characters takes a short story and transforms it into an epic. It also robbed me of my naive belief that Oscars were fair in all categories. 😀 I recommend this movie to one and all.",10
It is an awesome movie. i watched it and awesome work done by the actors and other people with great efforts.,9
"I feel that I probably wouldn't do this film justice if I were to leave a review. So, I will just leave it at this, do yourself a favor and make sure that you watch this movie at least twice - three times would obviously be better!",10
"One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect.Sad thing is that films as of this levels are no longer in making ... films with meaning. Contains a strong plot, powerful performances, and the ultimate theme of good and evil, is a masterpiece.",10
It was a classic movie. The actors do their best to make it best of all time,8
"I can't remember how I ended up watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it's been many years. I can't remember how many times I have watched it. I am not sure what ""new"" I can say about this movie, so let me say something simple. What I say will make sense to musicians and music lovers specifically those who adore Beethoven. This is what is to movies, what is Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15 Movement III ""Heiliger Dankgesang"" is to music. Thanks. I thought of keeping it simple, but it seems there is a rule that I should write 10 lines. So let me say if not for this movie and of course Beethoven's ""Heiliger Dankgesang"" I would have committed suicide.",10
"This is THE film. If aliens came down to earth, and said ""we will destroy your earth, unless you show us a good film,"" This film would bring peace to the universe. It was nominated for 7 Oscars, but they were stolen by Forrest Gump, which is good, but it is a spec of dust compared to The Shawshank Redemption.

Plot 10/10 - Best story ever.

Originality 10/10 - No other film quite like it.

Intelligence 10/10 - Very Intelligent

Acting 10/10 - All Actors = best performances.

Funny 6/10 - More of a smile film.

Tearjerker 9/10 - Watch it and shed a tear.

Feel good 10/10 - This film makes you feel good about life.

Narration 10/10 - Morgan Freeman has a great talking voice.

Overall this film is a masterpiece.",10
There are not many movies that are so beautifully edited and well acted. It is inevitable for Imdb to be in the first place. Congratulations to all players.,8
"After watching it a few time, this film has become my favourite! Each time I watch it I get more and more into the characters and I love it even more. On the contrary of what you might think at first the plot is not about escaping from the prison. If it was only that it wouldn't be anything special as there have been a lot of films on that subject. What the film is about is the development of the characters themselves.

I don't want to spoil it at all so I won't say any more about the story. All I can say is that I don't see to this day anything wrong with the film. Everything is brilliant from the acting to the music. I don't see how it is possible for somebody not to like it. I'd recommend it to anybody. It's one of those films which make you realize that you don't need CGI and big explosions to make a great film. But on the contrary big budget films are often the worst...",9
"This film is up there with the classics! Is a deeply moving story, which portrays friendship, trust, hope and corruption. The ending is superb, and brings a smile to my face every single time i watch it. It shows a very realistic view of prisons in the 1930's where the officers were almost, or even more corrupt and evil than the inmates.

This is film which will never become outdated or even considered to be 'coming of age'. With superb acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, it has to be the best film I have seen in a long long time.",10
Must watch movie. If you are searching for good movie must go on .....,10
Must watch. If you are searching for a good movie go for it ......,9
"""Shawshank Redemption"" breaks through the limitations of men's films, and the whole film is almost full of incredible warm tone, and the greatest theme of the film is ""Hope""",10

What is there to say about this movie that hasn't been said before in the era of endless PC drivle classics like this will remind you what a great movie and more importantly a well crafted and well told story should be.,10
We have watched it more than once and still enjoying,10

A most excellent film...watched many times. Never fails to be to enthralling,7
"Extremely well written script, great performances by cast and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax!

In short, I can say The Shawshank is one of the best dramas of all time!",10
"Though Freeman is our times Micheal Caine, his performance in this flick is quite sufficient or rather staggering. In Oscar terms, ""I would like to thank..."", haden't been disapointing to me. To reavel the plot or resolution is to say how ""The Mouse Trap"" ends. All I can say is see the movie. It might be a ""guy movie"" but it is the best drama ever....",10
"One of the best movies of all time!

I watch it every time I see it on TV.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption""

You might not remember the day you read that name and deciding whether to watch this title or go for something with a bit more Jazz, but you'd always remember that you have made the right choice once in your life.

This movie teaches one thing and one this only. HOPE!

Without hope there is no living. Hope is what makes us human and which is what this movie has so brilliantly portrayed. This movie will force you to do an introspection of your current status. You'd feel that all your problems are nothing if you'd just Hope that one day you'll get over it and have peace.

If this movie doesn't inspire you or change your thought process in some way or another, then there is something seriously wrong with the way you function.",10
Watch it and was stoned to see that it was so good. It might need a sequel,10
"Everyone lives in a kind of Shawshank prison, with all kinds of squeezing, physical and spiritual interlocking, breaking this and that.But with hope, there is peace of mind and belonging, because life is either busy living or busy dying.",10
Shawshank redemption is the best movie of all time,10
This movie is worth every minute! Brilliant cast and fantastic story.,10
"I have seen TSR about 5 or 6 times now, and every time I watch it, it's getting better! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great together and the end of the movie is the best movie ending ever!! A tale of courage and friendship. Go see it!!!",10
"This is not about a decent prison story. I have seen a lot about movies that tells you about what about life in prison, how scary it is and how strong the presence of injustice in there. But they never told one about character building inside of it.

Genius. In terms of building the character of. Andy and Red. How happens out there when somebody had you jailed inside of your mind and outside. Red somehow my favs character development. While Andy serve you about a true friendship and witty character. So much effort and acting in here. Almost a perfect score.",10
I enjoyed it it was good I like a lot of parts some not so much but was good,10
From start to finish I was hooked. I never wanted to stop watching this movie. Love it 10/10 wish I watched it sooner.,10
"I'm not gonna bother writing a long, in-depth review. You've read it all before. All I'll say is The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest film of all time! It's a masterpiece from start to finish! If you haven't watched it yet, you need to do so as soon as possible!",8
I'm totally impressed with the ideology and concept of this movie. I never forget each scenes of this movie.,10
"He's very smart and figures out a lot through the years he's in prison. I'm 12 but I think it's amazing and I definitely think if any parents read this, you should let your kids watch it.

I love this movie to motivate me . i will be appropriated and recommended all my friends .,10
I love this movie to learn and motivate me. i will be appreciated for this movie.,10
Best movie so far loved the performances Best acting Best storyline,10
This is one and only one movie i have been reviewed. Movies tells us about hope.,10
The movie is about an imprisoned man who finds solace in the rarest of places and makes him deal with the harsh truths of life in a hostile environment.The movie grips you from the start and by the end of it you wonder of the innumerable things the movie relates to you with. The actors justify their characters with some remarkably awestruck performances with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to be some of the notable ones. Frank Darabont depicts the writing of Stephen King quite exceptionally with some amazing shots apart from a few glitches here and there the whole movie just stands out apart from the rest of the movies.,10
"Best movie and best chosen cast, Morgan freeman is one actor i would love to work with and his voice makes you want to sit up and listen intently, simply pure class and acting.",10
"Mum brought this home from the video store when I was 15. It's the type of movie when you remember details of the night you first watched it. I remember thinking I hate prison movies.. this is really Going to suck. Never trust mums to pick movies. Five minutes in I was hooked. You remember the name of the town, don't you?",10
"First-time director/screenwriter Frank Darabont expands Stephen King's 1982 short story 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', into one of the most definitive, moving and uplifting films to be made in recent years. 'The Shawshank Redeption' is not just an acute prison drama, it remains a detailed an emotional study of humanities endeavour against hardship and repression. A standout performance by Morgan Freeman and dazeling direction by Darabont, are abetted by elaborate panoramic cinematography, a touching score and a malicious imposing character - the oppressive 'Shawshank State Prison' itself.

A melodrama of wasted lives and male bonding, nominated for 7 academy awards dispite a lukewarm box office reception.",10
I never watch this kind of movie this is masterpiece this movie just not entertain you but this motivates you how tackle your problems your opponent and one of the important is patience,10
"It's very very difficult to choose an all-time favourite film, but if i have to, this would be it. It has everything, the plot is amazing, a lot of memorable scenes or dialogues, characters are super well written, defined and acted. All departments of the film are brilliant. MASTERPIECE.",6
"The best movie in history.This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likeable and the best ending in any entertainment business",9
"What more can be said about this movie? There is a reason that it is number one on IMDb...a Website that is a database of every movie ever made...and it is still number 1.

When this comes on, no matter what time of the day, I know that I will be sitting and watching til the end. Great actors--I love Robbins and Freeman in this and the supporting actors are just as good , great story--(taken from a great short story)Even after reading the book the story is still exciting to watch unfold on the screen, and just amazingly filmed from start to finish!

This is one of my number 1 movies as well!!!",9
"Amazing movies and beautiful , but is not bad , I would like to watch",9
A great movie that comes from a great book. I subscribed to Peacock just to watch this movie on repeat. The reason I gave this a nine is because I feel that in my opinion there are numerous movies that surpass this film. Though this film is still great I believe there are better films.,10
Heartbreaking my all time favourite. The movie is just amazing. Narration is clearly the best!,9
This movie in beyond thinking. One can think to get himself out of the prison but no one can think like this guy thought and been successful to get himself out of the prison. Very enthusiastic and thrilling movie. One must watch it. Great Movie!!,10
"I cant describe how great this movie is cause its just beyond greatness , lets just talk about how simple was the conversations with the simple look on this movie that made me feel like i were living with each character and with all there points of view , their feelings and everything.

I got straight in the vibe with this movie and lost track of time since the beginning.

This movie changed my mind so much i realized that sometimes a simple story is more than enough to make the greatest movie of all time.

Great work from everyone worked on this movie and thank you all for this ultimate masterpiece.",10
"290/5000 Starting from Andy and Red, all actors played a wonderful role. And he made sure that this movie didn't come down first. I watched this movie too late. It was 2015. I had no opportunity to watch. And I watched it 3 times. Beer event and escape from the tunnel was very good. Hey Andy, why aren't you drinking a beer?",10
Its gives so much knowlege to me !! Its filled with creative and uniqness ! A must watch.,9
Love watching this movie over and over greatly recommended,10
"It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you. so amazing and incredible",8
If you are reading this chances are high that u have already watched the movie and this movie is way above a film which needs a review. Nonetheless this was obviously one of the best movies I have ever watched and as always Morgan Freeman's acting was just fabulous. I loved the fact that the ending was indeed quite clear be it good or bad and there was kinda an epilogue featuring the lead actors which satiated my thirst about all the story built up till the end. A masterpiece indeed.,10
I love this movie i have been waching it since i was a kid we used to have a vcr growing up amd my mom and my sister would watch this my mom loves it to it puts her to sleep and no movie does that,10
It's nice from cinematography and production but i think the script need something to be a good ending.,10
Everybody needs to watch this before they die- it's an incredibly important film to cinema and visual storytelling. Please please please watch this if you have not already!!,10
"Any other year, this would've won Best Picture. Probably Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Screenplay too. This film had the misfortune of going against juggernaut Forrest Gump, and there was no way that it could beat the hype surrounding the good (though not great) Gump. Still, seven years later, it looks like this is the film from 1994 that people will remember long after Forrest has faded away.",9
"If you didn't like The Shawshank Redemption, then you don't understand the concept of the film. Shawshank is the epitome of good film-making -- a fresh, interesting, verisimilar, detailed story coupled with acting that makes Tim Robbins stand out in my mind as Andy Dufresne himself. The imagery is beautiful, the story has few, if any, holes, and Morgan Freeman plays the character of Red, the film's narrator, exceedingly well. To those who find it unnatural that a murderer has matured into a wise, thoughtful man during a long tenure in prison, I suggest that there is no more logical place for such a transformation. Red has had 20 years (upon Andy's arrival) to think about the crimes of his youth, and has grown as a result. In short, Shawshank is a movie for people who like good stories. It will make you laugh, it might make you cry, and in the end, you'll simply feel good about life itself.",10
I do not know how many times I thought this film was finished and it was not - although it took a while to get into it the ending was so exceptional I`ve watched it time and time again. There were so many twists I was not expecting - the author should be applauded,9
A brilliant story ...telling about the life of prisoners....,10
This was such an amazing movie with an amazing plot.,10
"This movie remains you speechless. I am blessed that i watched this movie. Its my one of the favourite movies. In short this is hidden ""hidden gem of Hollywood"". If you are a true movie fan then sahwshank redemption is the best movie.",10
My boyfriend and I recite words from this movie all the time. We Never get tired of watching it ..some of the most memorable scenes ever reside in this movie.,9
I watch A LOT of movies and there's very few which I would have rated 10/10. I didn't get bored and I actually hadn't watched anything like it. Great overall!!,9
"This is one of the finest movies I have ever seen in my lifetime. Motivation , patience, focus . Full of hope.

Greatest film making.",9
"It's a legendary film - If you don't like it, you're wrong! Great story, acting, and suspense. I've seen it like 20 times.",7
"Is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.",10
This is the best movie classic from 90s only one word to say masterpiece.,10
"Today is Aug 2021, I am watching movie from 94, It like produced this year, truly this movie is over my expectations. Believe me or not, if u love to see drama or not, u will enjoy it. Watch it till the end then let me know if you will not enjoy it.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films of which people used to say ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"". Well, Frank Darabont had the courage to do it and the world owes him a debt of gratitude. With the advent of the 90s there was the feeling that Hollywood, and Hollywood audiences, could never again accept such a thoughtful, emotional and ""feelgood"" movie as Shawshank. It shouldn't have been made in this era but thank God it was. Stick it in black and white and it could quite easily have come right out of the 50s along with It's A Wondeful Life. Most 90s films to which the critics automatically responded with the word ""classic"", Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, Fight Club, may or may not endure ""the test of time"" but there's no such doubts about The Shawshank Redemption. It is a true classic.",10
This is the best film i have ever seen. Classic for ages),10
"Do I need to tell anything else? No, but I will, in Portuguese. The Shawshank Redemption was released over 20 years and is still the best of all. For many years simply ranks first in the Top250 IMDb. The performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are sensational. The plot, based on a short story by Stephen King, is exquisite. The director, Frank Darabont, also directed ""The Green Mile"", which, incidentally, is also based on a short story by Stephen King. The most wronged film in Oscar history. Gave chance to compete with another fantastic movie, Forrest Gump, which was more commercial, mainly because of the participation of Tom Hanks, who was high at the time, since it came from films such as Philadelphia and Sleepless in Seattle.",10
Just finished watching it and I can't believe I spent eighteen years of my life without watching this masterpiece.,10
"A thief, who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology, is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO.",8
"In 2021, this movies is still my best movies. So many things to be missed.. really one of the best memories of my childhood.",7
Probably the best movie you will ever see and must buy on DVD,10
"Bomb and bomb movie. I respect Frank Darabont. I like his films. In short this movie best and best, bomb and bomb!!!

Best sides: Soundrack, action, acting skills.",10
"Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free. After this watching this movie I understood what is freedom. If you are depressed just watch this movie, you'll understand the power of hope.

Direction:98% Acting:100% Dialogs:98% Screentime:91%(should be more) Story:89% Ending:watch the movie.",10
"Movie right at the beginning starts showing its quality of dialogues and thats the key for bounding the viewers .Then a fine story with great actors leaves an everlasting impression. Point of life after prison is also shown with a heart touching scene.Humanity in prison is raised by another scene. Overall this movie can't be compared with others as such a style of escape can't be said to be inspired.Atlast the movie gives a message of friendship,love and hope. A way of making prisoner's life more useful to the society and how education can affect the system is suggested.Combining these all elements in a series of events is commendable.The tag line of this movie is inspiring.",9
"Movie was a bit slow, but towards the end, it picked up the pace. It's a good movie to watch and learn film making. Good camerawork, acting, direction and even art setups. I was impressed to even watch recently again.",10
"I have been an avid fan of Stephen King since elementary school. I went to a catholic school from kindergarten through 8th grade. Of all places for me to pick up my first King book, it was at a book fair for my school. It was ""The Eyes of the Dragon"". I was hooked. I remember reading this short story and not thinking much of it. Previous King books-turned-movies offered a glimpse of what was to come. 90% of his movies are almost perfect transitions from print to screen. Green Mile is among the best as well, but...

...This movie definitely is what it is all about. I know it is cliché to say it, yet I feel there has never been a more appropriate comparison. This movie is like a fine wine. Not quite appreciated fully at first but as time passes, it is clearly head and shoulders above the rest. It was released in a year that saw amazing film-making. Gump takes the best picture, and there were a handful of others which could have taken that honor - had they been released any other year. Pulp Fiction most notably... Don't get me wrong, Gump is a great movie just not even close to best that year. 3rd or lower.

When I first joined IMDb, Shawshank was #2. I hoped one day it would overtake the top spot and it happened shortly after Dark Knight held it for a brief period of time. Here's to Andy & hope, it is a wonderful thing!",10
"By far, one of the best movie adaptations of a Stephen King novel to date. Perhaps a bit maudlin and sappy at times, it is an age old story of friendship, hope and redemption. A formula that head been done time and time again. What differentiates this film is that it doesn't get weighed down in that stereotypical quagmire. A brilliantly adapted screenplay, that conveys what daily life in prison is like. Not in the cartoonish manner of say, Jailhouse Rock. It is a journey into the dark, hopelessness of an evil institution resplendent with corruption, violence, and desperation. This is the rare Hollywood production that not only stirs up just about every human emotion, it reaches into your soul. All of the acting is superb, particular Tim Robbins. I suggest you read the book first, then watch the movie.",9
Best movie Alltime. That's it nothing better then this movie a classic that brings all the emotion into picture so yourself a favor and watch this movie you won't regret it. A must watch.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption, is one of those films, that stays in your mind long after the credits role off the screen. It is nothing short of a Masterpiece, adopted from a story written by Stephen King, Entitled ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"". The story takes place in the 1940's, in New England, and opens with the murder Trial of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robins), who is being tried over the murder of his wife and her lover. Andy is sentenced to life imprisonment, over a crime which he maintains he did not commit.

It is here, confined within the grey stone walls of the Prison, that he meets ""Red"", played superbly by Morgan Freeman. Red and Andy become the most unlikely of friends, and over the years their friendship grows. Andy shows Red that there is always hope, even in the bleakest of circumstances, and Hope is what will set you free.

The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable in every aspect. The storyline is fantastic, and the director pays a lot of attention to every part of it. The prison cellar shots are extremely realistic, even though they are built on a giant set. The acting is supurb, from the lead characters to the supporting cast. All in All, this film is nothing short of Brilliant, and will go down as the greatest film i have ever seen. 10/10",10
"This movie is so so great. It looks like no other movies. Well, I seldom gave 10 to a movie or series. Before this one, I only gave 10 to Gone with the wind and Arcane in IMDB. Great thanks to those creators playing a part in making it.",10
"In first I want to say the 1994 is greatest year in world can you see , and this movie is really different because the message is great, you can see it in deferant eyes, the message is hope and the hope is good thing , and there is no mistake , I can tell you about little details, this movie show prisont as I imagine but show me too something I don't know show or I understand the people who was prisont is different I mean they are not the same , at most bad but there is who he good.",8
"You have already watched this, right? It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation. Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I'm seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don't as a rule. Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.",10
"Shawshank Redemption like Forrest Gump, 1 + 1, And in my soul I'm dancing Until I played the box, Knocking on Heaven's Door, etc. This is the category of films after which you want to live and appreciate this life, as Andy Dufresne did . Secondly, the film itself is gorgeous and brilliantly shot. Thirdly, this film is a clear illustration that the success of the film depends not on a huge budget, not on a star cast, not on critical awards (yes, Moonlight?), not on a PR company, not on exorbitant box office receipts or awards (Escape from Shawshank has no big fees and no Oscar). No, a successful film needs a talented director and talented actors, and as a result, a film that has been on the first position of the Top 250 in IMBd and Kinopoisk for more than a decade. Fourthly, it's just a cinematic masterpiece, like the Titanic, The Green Mile, Forrest Gump, Hachiko and other great works.",10
"Brilliantly presented story. I'm not talking about acting, because I'm not an expert in this area, and the Russian voice acting saves everything. I was more fascinated by how interesting and brilliant the story of Andy was told in the film. It would seem that the entire film takes place in one building, the main character does not plan to escape the entire film. He just lives and throughout the film we observe his relationship with other prisoners, guards, the head of the prison. And all this is really interesting. Personally, for two and a half hours, I never got bored. I was worried about Andy when he was molested by rapists. I sincerely felt sorry for him when they lost hope. I was happy for him when he did. After all, in fact, the film is about life in all the diversity of its emotional spectrum, at the head of which is hope, like a ray of light to which we all aspire. Thanks for the masterpiece!",9
"Movies are all made for a purpose, most of those purposes are to make money - heck if they dont make money they cant make a movie, but some movies go beyond just trying to make a buck and really stand out as one of the best in their genres.

This is one of those movies.",10
"This was really good.

Sometimes we see some sort of movies that don't have good endings but this one is something else.

Full of Hope and have both emotional and funny scenes.",10
"Shawshank is one of the finest movie I have watched till date. The actor and directors did a tremendous job with the story and cinematography.

The life of andy describes a common man who is dealing with normal life problems like we all do.

The life in jail is another thing with all the characters blending in each other.

The revenge of andy was outstanding when he flew out of the prison and the jailer commits' subside after getting exposed.

I had goosebumps when Red wrote ""So was RED"" on the wall where Brook did his signature.",10
"""hope is a good thing. maybe the best of things. and no good thing ever dies.""

with a line like that, how can it not be good? King is a genius of writing. Darabont is a genius of directing. dream team.",10
"Knowing the original title in English changes your view of the movie from the very beginning.

I saw this movie in Japan.

However, I think I would have enjoyed the movie more deeply if I had known the original title beforehand instead of the title of the movie for Japan.

This movie is very deeply about cause and effect and that part of life.

Is it you who decide whether a deed is right or wrong? Is it still all about the values of others?

What happens when we consider the position of society and human beings in the name of ""position""?

I think this is one of the great works that expands the meaning of the word ""life.",9
A non-complex movie which keeps you tied even when not experimenting with the narrative too much. Its not an anomaly that the movie is seen as one of the great uplifting movies of all time.,10
When I saw the rating I couldn't believe it. This is indeed great for kids and parents to watch. Morale is spectacular and the actors are awesome. The best part is it is about the environment and classic cinema would approve. Watch it with your kids and tell me it's not worth it. Loved it and so did my kids!,10
"The first time I watched this movie it automatically became my favourite.

The way the story is portrayed and how smartly the directors have targed the viewers is incredible.

By the end you can't help but feel like this is a masterpiece and a once in a lifetime production that can only be pulled off by the best.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film so great that I don't really need to talk about it. It's in my top five favorite movies of all time, and one of the best written screenplays of all time. King was positively inspired when writing this, and the result is a gorgeous, compelling tale that can be watched by nearly anyone. The characters are fully developed and sympathetic, the plot is completely engaging and compelling, and there are some genuinely beautiful moments in this movie. This screenplay-as well as the film itself-is a gift to us from Stephen King that I will never forget.",10
"This is the best movie ever made - trust me.

It's certainly my favourite.

Amazing acting, from amazing actors, with an amazing story with an amazing ending. Beyond words, I'm afraid. Go and hire it. No, buy it, because you will want to watch it again and again and again.

If you liked The Green Mile, you'll love this. If you've never seen the Green Mile, you'll still love it.

Go, buy it. Take my car. Are you still reading? Go...

"This is quite simply,the best film ever made. Taken from a short story by Stephen King,it turns out to be a true cinematic masterpiece. It takes you through just about every single emotion possible,happiness,sadness,elation,fear and jubilation at the end. The more you see this movie,the more you appreciate just how amazing it is. Each time you watch it you pick out something extra that you hadn't noticed before,and that only adds to your appreciation of it. Tim Robbins' character is one you sympathize with right from the word go,you're rooting for him all the way through the movie,when he has his run-ins with Boggs and his cronies,to when you see him on the beach and he sees Red walking towards him. I know nothing about lighting,editing,or abstract plot development. But I know an awesome movie when I see one,and this is most definitely one of those. See it,be amazed,then see it again and be even more awestruck by its magnificence",10
"I've never been as intrigued and as captivated to a movie as I have with this one, an emotional rollercoaster that kept me on edge through and through, couldn't ask for more, a true masterpiece.",10
"One word Masterpiece. I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",10
"A successful banker, Andy Dufresne, was arrested for the murder of his wife and lover and sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank Prison. He will be the most unconventional prisoner.",10
"One of better of all times.Shawshank as a metaphor for surroundings of a human being,unfortunately more evil averagely,Andy for wiser,more just human in interactions with it.He confirms the rule that more just,wiser live longer and better because their ability is closer to the Ideal,Absolute.This humans can go closer to All,Unlimited because they understand themselves and the world more and better.With their wisdom they choose actions which lead them to lesser and lesser limitations.Andy is smarter and he sees the way out(a pipe) of bigger suffering over the river(closer to Freedom)which flows into the Pacific(Silence,Freedom).That scene when he exits the pipe and lifts his hands,smiling while the rain is falling on his face, is first among more astonishing in the history of film.On his way to Big Pax he doesn't forget others which need redemption.Red is among them (great Freeman who has the best last name a man can have and especially a black man).He is a killer so he can only partly redeem himself.Andy helps him and others showing them better way in life(cold beers,library,education).Red almost looses the will to carry on (Brooks)but Andy lifts him.And than the final embrace scene on the beach of the Pacific(Freedom)which is also among more beautiful in cinema.Because of all that The Shawshank redemption is a artistic masterpiece which I watched and will watch many times.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont and based on a novella by Stephen King, stands as a beacon of hope within the realm of cinematic storytelling. This film intricately weaves the dark and grim corridors of Shawshank prison with an underlying theme of friendship, resilience, and ultimately, redemption, which resonates deeply with audiences across generations.

Tim Robbins delivers a stellar performance as Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of a crime he insists he did not commit. His journey is one of quiet strength and intellect, qualities that carve out a space of hope and renewal amidst the oppressive walls of Shawshank. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Ellis ""Red"" Redding, the seasoned inmate and the film's narrator, is both touching and profound, offering a humane perspective to the harsh realities of prison life.

One of the film's standout attributes is its capacity to build complex, believable characters that evoke empathy and understanding. The camaraderie that builds between Andy and Red is both heartwarming and soul-stirring, representing the blossoms of friendship in the most unlikely of places.

Moreover, the cinematography is nothing short of brilliant, with each frame carefully constructed to depict the juxtaposition of confinement and freedom. The score complements the narrative perfectly, adding layers of emotion to an already poignant tale.

What makes 'The Shawshank Redemption' truly transcendent is its adept ability to encapsulate the essence of hope, the belief that there is a chance for something better, even in the face of insurmountable odds. It is a film that touches upon the human spirit's unyielding capacity for hope and redemption, making it a timeless classic that continues to inspire and uplift.""",10
"I always thought The Godfather or the Dark Knight were the gold standard of how movies should be written, until I saw the Shawshank Redemption. Forget Batman or Superman, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are THE World's Finest both in cinema and in general. Their chemistry as actors really sets them apart from every actor in the world. The director and the writers did a damn good job of tugging at my heartstrings 4. Times. That's never happened to me before. And parts like the one where Andy gave the maggot to Brooks to feed it to Jake the Crow, completely broke me and my heart into thousands of pieces. If you want a movie that will change your life or leave you a sobbing mess, The Shawshank Redemption is the movie for you.",9
"Probably the best movie on the internet, I just can't believe my eyes that anyone can make this kind of movie, really it won my heart! I cry,i laugh and there comes a feeling which can't be described in words. I rate this movie as the best i have ever seen. Some moments in the movie makes me hold my bed pillow in the tightest ever grip. I can guarantee that this movie will leave an impression in your mind for a long time. I even say that this movie is better than shawshank redemption.fantastic story, brilliant acting,mind boggling feelings and overall an unforgettable drama. If you have watched 1000 movies and not this then your movie watching journey is incomplete.i will also make sure that even my next generation should watch this one.",10
"One of the greatest movies ever made. The Shawshank Redemption is truly a masterpiece in my eyes, with a perfect cast, score, direction, and writing. The film explores friendship, struggle, freedom and perseverance, and a film that is impossible to dislike in my opinion. I loved every single performance in that movie, from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown to James Whitmore, and the direction by Frank Darabont was extraordinary and he went on to direct more great movies including""The Green Mile"" and ""The Majestic"". The story which was originally a short story by Stephen King was also one the best stories I've ever seen, along with a terrific and catchy score by Thomas Newman that could stay in my head for days, and I could not be tired of it afterwards.

This truly one the greatest movies of all time and one of my favourite movies too, in fact I think is not only the Best movie of 1994, but the the best movie the decade, in my honest opinion. Films like The Shawshank Redemption are why I love the movies.",7
"Its difficult to put a finger on what exactly it was about The Shawshank Redemption that I fell so in love with that I have seen it over and over again and every time there was a new element in the movie that fascinated me.

A seemingly simple story of two men in prison and their lives over a period of twenty years.But presented with such elegance that you can actually relate with all the characters and feel bad for them,love them,hate them.A superb movie and an ever better adaptation of a Stephen King novella,beating even one of my personal favorites 'The Green Mile' in the process.The development of the characters is so realistic that you can actually see them aging,physically and emotionally,throughout the length of the movie.The story,in spite of its simplicity,keeps you glued to the screen due to the brilliant handling of the main plot and various sub plots and how they come together in the end.Every small,seemingly insignificant element merges seamlessly with the story which is rare to see in any movie these days.The lead actors,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both are at their best,although the better actor without a doubt is Tim Robbins playing an incredibly complex character and looking at ease throughout.

This is the kind of movie that you will think and talk about long after you are done watching it.The theme of never losing hope is somewhat a lesson to all of us.I wouldn't dream of letting out the plot in anyway because if you haven't seen the movie yet,just go and watch it.It will move you and amaze you like nothing you have ever experienced.

10/10..simply brilliant..",10
"For 2 hours and 22 minutes, the film keeps your attention unlike any other movie out there. The cast and characters blend perfectly to create a thrilling and emotional movie which creates a beautiful rollercoaster ride.

The relationship between Redd and Andy is flawless as their characters grow throughout the film. The supporting cast is even able to create emotional attachments to their characters.

Smiling, laughing, and crying are some of the main emotions that come out of the film. No matter what time of day it is, if this movie is on tv, it will stay on and be watched.

If you have no had the chance to spend the time to watch, I highly recommend. Do not miss out.",10
"This is one of my all time favorite movies. The storyline, acting, set design, and cinematography were some of the best I've ever seen.

From scene to scene, everything made sense, everything was logical, and the manner in which each character had their own ""breakout"" moment is one of the things that set this movie apart from others like it. The emotional connection or feeling that every actor brought to this movie, made it entertaining, compelling, and worth watching.

Andy delivers moments of mental exhaustion, conflict, and turmoil that would've broken a normal man in his situation. While being falsely imprisoned, he manages to find ways to get through the daily uncomfortable grind of being in prison in the 60's, while at the same time trying to keep from snapping.

Red's character brings something to the film that is meaningful, inspiring, and motivational to every scene he was featured in. Life lessons, charming whit, and a wise man demeanor puts him on a level only seen by ""mob bosses"" during this time.

There were a few timeline inaccuracies that kept me from giving this movie a full 10 stars, but it's definitely worth watching.",10
"This is my Strict advice on hiring a hacker, Never hire a hacker with a Gmail account because from my research and experience so far , hackers don't use Gmail because it does not have a location encryption enabled on Gmail.

And if you must hire a hacker , You should had over to deep web and precisely Dark Basin Forum or CryptBB forum where hackers listed their services and they are all screened before listing their services on those forums. I have also hired a hacker in the past months hence I got the experience , I needed a phone on my spouse and hackerspytech @ gmail com was the exact hacker group I used due to their 87% review on phone hacking. They had more reviews on those forums and I strongly advice you make research before wanting to hire a hacker so you wont fall into the wrong hands .",9
"Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made,This is something more than just a movie and seeing that it was made in 1994 was really unbelievable.

This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.

This movie is a true gem. Its powerful and moving with powerful quotes.

One i liked the most is: You either get busy living or get busy dying. Life throws many things at you you can either compare and complain or accept it and get 1% better everyday.

It shows the life behind the bars potraying alot of realistic moments. The protagonist was an innocent man locked behind bars suffering yet he seemed like a carefree guy who always kept his mind busy. The movie shows how with financial education you can survive anywhere.

Afterall it was a remarkable greate movie.",10
"Such a phenomenal piece of art. I have been hearing from years about Shawshank Redemption but never cared to give it a try. But now, yes now after finally experiencing it I can say it was...WORTH IT. An innocent man lost and stuck in the horrible world making his way out, what else do you need? This story is one of the very few that in the end makes a person finally satisfied. From the beginning to end the characters and the story never feels exaggerated. From evilness to good there's everything here. A man preaching God's name yet sinning and a man who thinks he killed his wife without shooting the gun and a man who's known to locate certain things from time to time...we got all of it. Such a brilliant piece, forever will be remembered down the cinematic history.",1

"This is a must seen Movie !

I remember when I was in Denmark years ago & visiting my relatives, one evening I was talking to my grand cousin about movies & stuffs like that,

when we came to a point where he gaved me the recommendation to watch Shawshank Redemption!

I did & this movie just blowed my mind. I mean everything has been said already still though, do yourself a fav.

& watch this movie if you haven't already & if you'd like to take something with it! The strength & everything included in this movie is just magnificent!",10
"shawshank was one of the first videos i ever purchased. this film has it all; great character development; poignant humor; heart-in-throat drama. this was the first time frank darabount directed a stephen king story - the second time was The Green Mile. needless to say, the darabount-king hookup provides strong filmmaking for the theater-goer.

a must see.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is great picture. (My remark) is also an annoying cliché. I am not the first person to daydream and then write why this is the best-loved movie either.

The top movies are: a) War dramas/ b) Wild West masterpieces/ c) Pop Culture. The latter category is populated especially by Mafia movies, stories about capable people hidden from the eyes that govern most people's lives. Movies about the most successful of us that live their own way. In other words, Cool films.

Alright, so what is ""Shawshank"" doing among these? My take is that Shawshank touches a key in every one of us, and that key sounds as a description of freedom. It has no subtle, hidden messages. It's not cool. It's plain, straightforward. It has -though, this subject that may be the most sought right in the history of man. We always say after we pass a bleak period of our lives that it's good to know a deeply low and depressing moment since you know it cannot be worse. Well, that's the feeling I get about Shawshank's resonance.

In some sense, I find a comparison basis with The Beatles. Why were the latter the best ever music group? Well, because they were so simple yet so effective. Does music or film has to have a deep hidden message? Music and film must impress, first and foremost. Why we are most of the time preoccupied of making a difference from other people through our preferences, separating ourselves by fake elitist values, instead of creating something our own (in some sense ""our own, together""), making us known through our very names. But I digress and I apologize for maybe wasting your time.

The bottom line is not that Shawshank is the best, but that it is a favorite, a loved picture, like many others. Don't we have to give a ten to oh-so-many others without being able to give it more. Likewise it impresses us that at the end credits we just keep silent just to not be clichéd. At least we come here and write reviews...",10
Never have i seen a movie so well directed the script was genius....one of the best movies ive ever seen.....10/10 eaisly!!! Morgan freeman and tim robbins made this movie work....if forest gump came out a year later this movie would have swept the oscars.,9
"A month back I thought I'd look for some good movies on IMDb again, and surprisingly saw that there was a new rookie in the Top 250 list. The shawnshank redemption. After checking that the movie plots fit my likings, I decided to give the ""ahem ahem"" version a shot. Sure I didn't expect it to beat my favorite movies, the godfather.. fight club.. terminator 2, but thought It'd be watchable as it had the titles I liked.

Then came weekend, and I sat down and watched the movie. I was immediately thrilled after first 30 minutes, and later on kept hoping It'd never end. But once the end came, I sat there, eyes a bit wet, and thought WOW. This truly was the best movie I've ever seen, beating everything else in the IMDb list.

Afterwards, I went and ordered the DVD (2 of 'em to cover my illegalness in the first place) and watched the extra contets as well. Truly a 1# of all time.

I'm going to miss Morgan Freeman when he leaves this world.",10
"There is nothing that i can say that has not already been said in a very positive way about this movie.I simply loved it.I do wish however that a ""Special Edition"" DVD of Shawshank would be released that would include the 1 hour TV feature of all the actors making comments on it.The current dvd does not have enough included for a great movie of its stature. This movie will certainly become a classic.Watching this movie actually makes me feel proud to be human.It re-affirms my belief in mankind.Now if only every president,prime minister and leader would watch it and get the same feeling from it as i did......geez....maybe they would WAKE UP and realize that ""Life Is To Short""....Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying!!",10
"What can I say that hasn't already been said. A fantastic movie which has been played to death on TNT. Still, it's a great film. One of those films that jocks say is their favorite film to show they're film buffs. Anyway, a great movie with a lot of heart.",10
"This ranks as one of my all time favourite movies. There is so much to love about this movie, the characters, Morgan Freeman's narration and the story. The movie runs for quite a while, but it hardly seems so. A definite must own movie.",10
Extremely well written script and story. One of the best dramas of all time! It makes you to think about basic things that you have and don't appreciate enough.,10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic gem that masterfully explores the complexities of the human condition within the harsh confines of a prison. Through its compelling characters, evocative themes, and brilliant craftsmanship, the film inspires reflection on the power of hope, friendship, and the pursuit of redemption. It remains an enduring testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the potential for transformation even in the bleakest of circumstances. At its heart, the film explores themes of hope, resilience, friendship, and the quest for redemption. The iconic poster of Rita Hayworth that Andy uses to conceal his tunneling efforts becomes a symbol of escapism and a metaphor for the characters' desire to transcend their circumstances. The repeated motif of ""get busy living or get busy dying"" reinforces the power of choice in the face of adversity.",7
Idk it wasn't as interesting as it was made to be. Not happy with the results.,7
"This would have to be one, if not the greatest movie i have ever seen. Why Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabond did'nt win a thing from the work they put into it is so beyond me, this has the perfect quality of what Oscar Winning movies are made of. Compared with many other heart wrenching films made to date this movie is Good, Better, Best.",10
"This is a moving picture that will leave you with an experience. There are still films I need to see, but so far this ranks as without a doubt my favourite. No other film has provided me with such a tremendous emotional rush in its last third, or set itself up so well to do so with everything before it. A fantastic story told by the best of direction, acting and music. The Greatest.",10
"It contains the best plot twist in the history of cinema. While we never heard from Tim Robbins again, or at least anything to top this performance, his portrayal of the banker accused of a crime he may not have committed is masterful. Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman since time immemorial; he is without a doubt the best counterpart there could be for the protagonist. And while Andy Dufresne's story is the central theme, Brooks' story is the one that most faithfully portrays that redemption and all that lies behind the rehabilitation of the prison system. One of Frank Darabont's best works, but under the protective mantle of Stephen King's book, which is always, or almost always, a guarantee.",9
"I'm a guy that takes pride on the fact of being quite open-minded when it comes to appreciating different genres and kinds of stories. I love movies that faithfully and movingly depict the ugly side of humanity, but every now and then I also like something that tells us that not everything is lost.

The Shawshank Redemption introduces us to Andy Dufresne. A gentile yet emotionally estranged banker who's wrongfully accused of murdering his wife and her lover. This brings him to a gruesome prison were his will to maintain his humanity will be put to the test by the corrupt and abusive authorities of the prison, and also by some of his fellow inmates. In this bleak scenario he will find hope in the guise of friendship. Which will push him to rise above the situation.

This movie is all about hope. About the power of friendship and the reluctance to give up on life, even under the darkest circumstances. Even locked in a pit of pure evil, human spirit can be enough to lift you up.

Tim Robbins is convincing and moving in his performance, although he is outshone by a brilliant Morgan Freeman, who always seems to effortlessly touch the soul of the audience with his performances. The bad guys also generate the right amount of repulsion, with a good job from Bob Gunton as the morally questionable warden and Clancy Brown in the memorable role of the violent and vicious captain Hadley.

I've seen some reviews questioning the placement of this film as #1 for IMDb users. I don't think any of us can put a movie above all the rest or below them. Art is subject to personal appreciation and there will never be a single opinion more valuable than the rest. What's undeniable is that Shawshank caused what it intended. Moving the majority of people that have seen it through a beautiful story that aims to the human spirit and it's power to shed light in the darkest moments.",10
"One of the best stories on film. Acting, cinematography... it's all in there. A must see. A piece of our history as filmmakers.

This story is compelling as you feel for each characters' deep struggles within a community of inmates. A range of characters excite the plot with its unexpected culture as an intimate story unfolds of secrets, shame, struggle and finally triumph. Morgan Freeman deserves an Oscar for his amazing performance and Tim Robbins executes his character flawlessly as Andy Dufresne, a man of clever who navigates his way through a sharp turn to a new way of life. This story isn't missing a morsel and keeps you on the edge of your seat with mystery, murder and the element of surprise.

The Shawshank Redemption shares the ranks of the best feature screenplay I have ever read. It read unlike any other and was the kind you can't put down. Saving Private Ryan comes in at a close second. Frank Darabont is a hell of a writer and is also credited with The Green Mile and developed The Walking Dead series.",8
"I rated this movie a 6 mainly because not only is this based on a Stephen King novel, but it is also IMDb's No.1 rated movie! I had very high expectations and presented this movie to watch with friends during our ""movie night"". I have to be honest, my high expectations did lead to a slight disappointment.

I feel the movie was quite slow paced, it is about 2 and a quarter hours long and I felt a few parts could have been cut. The acting was definitely excellent, Morgan Freeman delivers his best all the time and the storyline and plot were very clear. One main thing though is that I don't understand how almost everyone is rating this a 10/10 when I feel there are many more movies probably more deserving? Could be classified as a good movie, a really good movie but certainly not a great movie.",10
"To me, it's the supporting cast and the attention to detail in this time period movie that make it an outstanding movie. It's in a class with The Godfather and A Man For All Seasons. Outstanding finish after considering how we viewers suffered through the prisoners' treatment at the hands of the guards and administration.",10
"You do not need to know about the plot or the characters or the actors, know only this:

Shawshank redemption is an amazing film. You must watch this, you will not regret it.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is the greatest prison film ever made, in fact it is probably the greatest film ever made. Morgan Freeman is absolutely brilliant and is mirrored by a surprising Tim Robbins this is a devastating, heartwarming, riveting cinema at its very best everyone will remember this film 10/10 and justifiably so.",10
In my opinion it's the best movie ever they all did the best performance,10
"Let me keep it straight and simple..

I am simply too impressed and therefore out of words to describe what this movie portrays.

The acting and realism of this fiction is eye catching. I really wonder how much better it would get if it was based on a true story.

Indeed, you can rate, review, describe, audit, revise or summarize a movie, but not art.

Whether you are a movie fan or not, simply don't miss this one if you are a human !

BTW, Mr. Brooks was my favorite character.",10
"Shawshank Redemption along with Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Star Wars, Goodfellas, and the Godfather are worth every amount you spend. Even though this movie isn't at all like the Stephen King novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", this movie has done some amazing changes with comparisons to the novel and ultimately, I thought the film was better than the novel itself. I was blown away by the storyline, especially when Morgan Freeman was narrating. However, it was a disappointment that the film never won any of seven academy award nominations. If you are looking for a film to watch: one that has an amazing script you hardly see in today's films, one that has some great actors, and one that shows a strong bonding of friendship... this is the one to see! I give this film a 10 out of 10 because it was worthwhile watching and was worth every penny I spent on the 10th anniversary DVD.",10
"Well, after all the glory this film has had, I decided to watch it. And for my opinion, it wasn't that great. Was it the hype, I don't know..I just didn't like that much to esteem the movie as #2 in IMDb top 250 list. It was just as boring as Stephen King's book are. Afer all, acting was great, I have no bad things say about that, it's only a bad script, for my opinion. Nowadays, when there's such realistic prison descriptions, as OZ and Prison break, this one doesn't give the spark. For a good prison movie I reckon the following: If you wanna see a good prison movie, you should watch ' Blood In Blood Out ', If you haven't had a chance already. Now, there's a reality check and a great movie, which haven't lost it's best-before date, like this one has.",1
"I enjoyed this film but it is very derivative and is not the profound masterpiece people here seem to think it is. The problem is that people either have a short memory or don't bother to watch older films because they are not in colour or have unfamiliar actors. People are especially lazy about foreign films and find reading subtitles irritating. ""The Birdman From Alcatraz"" is a much finer movie in virtually every way - Hanks simply does not have the gravitas of Lancaster. To prattle on about this being some great movie shows a complete ignorance of films. Great film-makers are Tarkovsky, Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut etc etc. ""Shawshank"" is very targeted at middle-of-the-road America (which includes the UK as we have been thoroughly burgerised by your so-called culture) which goes down great with a cola and a bucket of popcorn. It is a very old-fashioned film which reminded me of the classics of US movies like ""The Grapes of Wrath"" and those Cagney films where he goes mad in solitary. I think these polls are ok but all we end up with is the most popular films at this present time. In 10 years time this film will be forgotten as the next popcorn-pleaser takes over. For years I couldn't understand what the academics were going on about with films by Antonioni or Eisenstein. But I made the effort and over time I came to realise that the profs knew what they were talking about. I have a list of films here which I hope some of you ""Shawshank"" fans will eventually work through. ""Death in Venice"", ""The Seven Samurai"", ""To Live"", ""Wild Strawberries"", ""Jules et Jim"", ""Andrei Rublev"", ""Grand Hotel"", ""8 1/2""... I am sure you can find more in this website. ""Shawshank"" is a nice little film, but you are being spoonfed. Stretch yourself - there is a whole big movie world out there way beyond the confines of today's Hollywood. If you go on this journey in a few years time you will hardly remember this film.",10
"I have been into movies since, well I was 5. But after about 15 years I finally was lucky enough to come across this title. I had a huge expectation when I started watching it.Hey! it ain't number 1 for show that much i can vouch for. Well it took me a few minutes to get into it but well once i got engulfed it was just sheer pleasure and goosebumps.

The film revolves around the inmates of a prison and a NEW FISH accused of homicide joining the faculty.The film depicts How he changed their lives and helped them to realize and bring back the greatest gift of life taken away from them . The friendship, the hardship, the simplest joy, the tragedies , the yearning for freedom in each breath has been brilliantly acted and directed.The movie makes you feel good.After watching it it makes you smile and strengthens your faith in humanity.I am no critic but this movie made me happy, ecstatic and I would love to re-watch it again and again.

so i would say go on watch it at once if you have not. You will love it no matter what your taste in films are. Because this film expresses humanity in each way possible. And as a fellow human being you will love the emotions. If you don't then well I will be a bit surprised.

P.S 1994 was the year of Forrest Gump. It took home all the awards. Though it is a great film but in my opinion it remains only great while shawshank is one of the greatest if not the greatest movie of all times. Thank You...",9
"I'd like to remind those few Nay Sayers that have labeled SSR as an overrated film that it sure wasn't overrated by the Academy in 1994. In fact, it didn't win a single Oscar! Thanks to IMDB, the public has spoken -it's truly a People's Choice! Obviously, we each have a right to our opinion, and I respect (though cannot understand) the opinions of those that have expressed dissent about the film. Rather than remain in a quandary as to how it could have been elevated to number 2 all-time, perhaps you should try watching the film again to see if, by chance, you missed the boat on it the first time around. There's no vote-fixing going on here, folks! I stand in harmony among those who have been enlightened by this masterpiece and lend my hand in lifting it to the top.",10
"This movie is a classic, first of its kind as far as prison breaking idea is concerned, the will of a man to help the prison, the grudge of a man against a corrupt officer and lastly the friendship that starts with two phrases of conversation that lasts forever.

The whole plot revolves around Andy Dufresne who is a prisoner at the Shawshank prison for a crime he hasn't done. He makes friendship with Red, an inmate, who has been prisoned for 20 years and the only person who can get you almost anything from outside world.

Andy, a banker by profession, helps the prison guards to evade Income Tax for free and only demands beer for his fellow inmates thus winning the hearts of his friends, who are ready to do anything for him. Later, he switches his attention to the prison library and totally revolutionizes it by buying good books, music platters, a gramophone, thus making it the best library in the state. He, then switches his attention to Tommy, an illiterate, who has the zest to study and come up in life. He teaches him from A,B,C to everything required for a person to clear the metric exam. He also works for the Warden, a corrupt person who can do almost anything for money.

Andy is a person who likes to keep himself busy, and at day he does all the above things to fulfill it. But, at night when he is idle, he drills a huge hole using a rock hammer and shades it with posters of beautiful women and cases the hammer within the bible given to him.

It so happens that Tommy becomes a witness of Andy for not killing his wife and his wife's lover, but the Warden, kills Tommy just because releasing Andy would stop all the monetary inflow into Shawshank.

After he escapes the prison after 20 years of digging, he unfolds the corrupt warden's crimes to the press and escapes to Mexico without leaving a trail. The Warden, out of embarrassment and fear of being legally sued commits suicide which becomes a major factor for the release of Red a few months later.

Red follows the instructions given by Andy and both later meet in Mexico.",10
"There isn't much I feel needs adding to the praise already given to this film. But I know exactly what another reviewer meant when they said they wished they hadn't seen this movie, so they could enjoy it for the first time all over again. It really is such a complete film, with an ending which has likely caused many to privately shed a tear and then deny it afterwards down the pub..... :-)",10
"This movie, in spite of several violent scenes, is well acted and has a great plot line. The casting is excellent and the movie has moments of brilliance and is overall an excellent movie. The ending is satisfying and even though the characters are prisoners they have an air of honesty and a desire to simply (a) accept responsibility for their crime and (b) to be able to live a life of peace and pursue happiness. Far too many times, in movies and on TV, men in prison are shown to be soulless/corrupt/violent/without redeeming qualities and yet our prisons are FULL of people who are INNOCENT of the crimes they are in prison for and the cops/prosecutors are NOT always right and they are, in many cases, as corrupt as the worst offenders. This movie is a classic and has withstood the test of time. Take care and may God bless you.",10
Highly recommend highly recommend highly recommend,10
"The Shawshank Redemption, is without a doubt the greatest film the world has ever come across. From the moment i sat down to watch this, the mutual hype made me sceptical whether it will live up to my expectations, but it could not have blown me away any more than it did. Tim Robbins takes the leading role and in my opinion couldn't have done a better job, along with Morgan Freeman who delivered a fine supporting role. The compelling storyline, directing, casting and more importantly, acting throughout the cast made this my favourite film ever. I gave it 10 out of 10 because of this and out of the hundreds of films i have rated, it was the only one with a perfect score. This film is about as 'must watch' as it gets, and anyone who hasn't must do so right away otherwise they are severely missing out.",10
"This movie has to be one of the very best films i've seen in my lifetime. I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal of the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation from the Stephen King book. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail smuggler, better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did. The cinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old decaying prison. The movie may not have received any Academy Awards (the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year) but it still remains to be one of the best films around. If your looking for a deeper movie more than you're typical action flick, this will provide what you were looking for. Go out and rent it, heck go and buy it because you'll want to watch it time and time again.",10
This was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. Great story. Great character development. It is a story of hope for the ages. I thought it has some elements of reality in all of our lives. Red accepts he is stuck in prison. Tim Robbins character is amazing and is the focal point of the story. He exemplifies many emotions throughout the film.,10
Great and well planned movie with perfect acting and thrilling plot,8
It was really co-relatable. Titles to the reviews play a big part in the approval of your reviews.If your titles are not upto the mark then there is a great change of your review being disapproved.,10
"This masterpiece has taught me the meaning of the word hope. The ending was far better than winning the lottery or even accomplishing your dreams.

Superb acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, a job beautifully executed.

When my little girl is old enough to understand the concepts of life, hope and dreams I will be sure to watch this movie beside her, God permit.

If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend you do so. I will do my best to remember the words of wisdom and caring actions demonstrated by the character Andy. If we all did, we would all live in a better world.

10/10",10
"One of those bores that liked it before all the hoopla...remember getting to watch as I'd read the Stephen King short story in the collection of novella's* of which it was part (which I had only read as it contained the short story 'the Body' which was turned into my previous favourite film, Stand by Me)

Upon watching what I thought was an astonishing film on video, I wondered why I hadn't heard of this being at the cinema or talked about....although I say that latter point now...it's probably something that has developed over time... much like the buzz for the film itself... I can say it remains to this day the only film that I have watched after reading the story, that is much better and more poignant than the book from which it came.

The film itself is told in a great way and filmed brilliantly...not least captured by the character of the warden (depicting what were 3 in the novella). It is full of great supporting characters and turns and there are two brilliant male leads (they both should've have got an Oscar nomination with one of them winning!). It's a film where if I started writing about the components of, or scenes from, I could go on For longer than the film itself...(which despite its length never felt like a long movie!) So will just say that I'd recommend watching it to anyone. I've watched it copious times since first viewing and it never gets boring or do I seem to switch off when it's on...so a boring choice of favourite film, but it really is a great movie.10/10

* the collection (4 seasons) of short stories also contains Apt Pupil, which is probably the best of the novella's but was turned into a pretty average movie!",10
"I think this is an excellent film, I'm a bit of a ""prison film freak"" so among all prison films I'll rate this one as the second best. obviously Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is the absolute best one! Well back to Shawshank.. The way the film is made is just extraordinary!! I Love the way Morgan Freeman plays his sympathetic character.. last part is a bit disappointing, cause it's too similar to escape from Alcatraz.

Well anyway it'll get *******/**********",10
"A friend of mine once asked ""why is The Shawshank Redemption so good?"".

So let me tell you.

Visually I find the movie excellent. Now I can't say I am an expert in movies, but in my opinion the acting is very good. The parts for Andy and Red aren't extremely difficult or anything, but they are carried out truly well. Also the supporting actors were good, though I don't think they match the leading actors' performances.

Some shots in the movie are awesome. Just tiny little details and angles make them special. I could pull out many examples, but you should watch the movie yourself and see those little things that I believe make it excellent.

Now what I have mentioned above, won't make the movie one of the best ever. But then there's the story. Oh yes the story. Written by Stephen King, it's basically very simple at the start and gets more complex and spreads out like a cobweb. In the middle, we have interesting twists and then near the end, the ultimate climax. Now another thing I found interesting about the plot, was that the actual ""high-point"" of the movie was not as near to the end as usual. The movie kind of lets you cool down before the very end. I found that great.

That was The Shawshank Redemption technically, now people find like a new dimension in it emotionally. It's a movie about hope and friendship. It touches almost everyone who watches it. It evokes strong feelings. It's what makes it the best movie ever.",10
"I have to say that at first, I thought this movie would be boring. The storyline seemed so plain to me that I thought it was just one of those movies I would fall asleep to. But, one day, I decided to give this movie a shot. The storyline was simple as I had expected it to be but the director definitely did a good job in keeping it interesting all the same. The acting was flawless and even though the ending was a little bit too 'happy' for me, it didn't hurt the movie as a whole. It's not the best drama I've seen in my life, but it's definitely a movie that will keep you entertained and make you think about certain things in life.",9
"I had the privilege of going to the 25th anniversary celebration of the release of the Shawshank Redemption at the Ohio Stare Refromatory in Mansfield, Ohio where a lot of the movie was filmed. After that, my wife and I decided to pull out our copy of the movie. I totally forgot how good this movie is. The movie is kind of a throwback to movies of the 40's. The music was nostalgic from that period. The screenplay was just incredible. The lines from the movie are almost poetic with almost every scene giving you dialogue you think about and contemplate. Then, we have the acting. The cast choices seem almost perfect. Morgan Freedman and Tim Robbins made the most of their parts and inhabited their respective roles. Tim Robbins as Andy makes the transformation from being a free man to con without any cliche. He loses his innocence, but not his hope. Morgan as Red in essence makes the opposite transformation from hardens con to someone who has hope in his future. Gil Bellows and William Sadler put in good performances as part of Andy and Red's ""crew"". The cinematography was wonderful showing prison in mostly greys and darkened shadows. The scenes where both Andy and Red are out of prison show the free world with all of it's wonderful light and color. I think the strange thing about this movie is that you need to seen it several times to find all of the subtlety that lies within it.",10
Great perfomances. Intriguing script. Not a waste of time. Not a blockbaster type. A movie to remember.,10
"An emotional rollercoster that plods along for almost 3 hours. It's only a few days later you realise how good a film it was and how it alters your perception of life itself.

You almost have to watch a second time just to try and understand what it is that you like so much, unfortunately, I still dont know why it has such an impact on me. I have now seen it 6 times and it still makes me cry in wonder!",10
"Let me start with the basics...fantastic story...amazing direction...great dialogues...groundbreaking performances...heart aching soundtracks...and a priceless lesson in living...

No movie probably can touch you more positively than Shawshank Redemption...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman would be just as in trouble for this as Al Pacino had for Godfather. Just like Al is forever remembered for his depiction of Don Corleone in Godftaher, both these actors, who have had a long line of brilliant performances, would at the end of the day, be remembered for their roles as Andy and Red. For about two hours or so, every viewer would be transformed into an inmate of the Shawshank Prison, share their lives, feel sorry for their miseries and glow in their joys. It is a movie which has the rare capability of making you smile and cry at the same time.

It is probably the most underrated movie of all times. The reason i say this is because, notwithstanding the fact that it is the number 1 in IMDb's top 250, it is sad to see that its not one of the top grossing movies of all time. But then again some movies are too good to be enjoyed and favoured by everyone. It takes special kind of movie lovers to enjoy a movie of the calibre of SR.

To borrow the words of Morgan Freeman, some things are better left unsaid. See the movie for yourself and if it doesn't make your heart weep and ache at its beauty, then well, you're not just one of those special kind I am afraid.",10
"I heard about this movie very much some use to say ""this is the greatest ever movie"" but after watching it I started saying ""what a movie(I mean awful)?There is nothing great about this movie its a boring 2 hours crap.The story is about a guy called Andy(Tim Robbins) is convicted with crime which he has not committed.The whole movie describes Andy life in prison and finally how he escapes from the prison which takes almost 20 years for him to escape.If anyone has a very high expectations about this film then please erase it.Its just a ordinary movie there is nothing in this movie.If someone want to kill a time then watch it.I m going with 6/10 for this movie.Not so good,Not so bad.",10
"An awesome movie... a must watch for every Cinema lover. If you haven't seen this movie you have missed one of the top movies in the last 20 years. One of the all-time best films ever.

Robbins plays Andy Dufresne (a banker wrongly convicted of slaying his wife and her lover) with such perfection, you become convinced of not only the role of this protagonist, but the nature of his character. It is his unquestionable performance that ultimately leads us to be surprised by the changes in the character in the last third of the film. The changes are smart, clear and reasonable, but like real life, they are surprising. This is Robbin's best acting ever.

Morgan Freeman plays an inmate in the Shawshank prison that eventually befriends Andy and is the only one to gain insight into the real motivations of his friend.

A true master piece.",10
"How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.

Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.

But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.",10
The Shawshank Redemption is itself a masterpiece. Story revolves around the main charcter andy. and wonderfully crafted story around him. Also the use of background score and cinematogrphy plays wonderful role in the film.,10
"... it has to be felt.

Look at these comments. People around the world, from India to China to England to god knows where else, have been deeply touched by this film. Yes, some people don't get it. But look at those who do! The religious find God in it. The secular find the best of humanity. Those who were despairing found hope. Skeptics... doesn't that count for something?

Enough has been said about the cinematography, the score, the directing and what not. All those technical things that a film needs to be great. And all those things were great in this movie, in my own, uneducated, estimation.

But that's not why I love it. I love it for what it did to me.

When this movie came out, I was fresh out of college and working my first job in Miami -- some 1,500 miles away from anyone I loved or who loved me. I never wanted the job, in fact, I had to bite my tongue to keep from crying when they offered it. But there was a recession in my industry, so I felt I had to.

In short, I was in prison. We've all been there, at one point or another.

Shawshank gave me my life back. I watched Andy mail a letter a week; I mailed 10 a week -- resumes and portfolios sent to anyone I thought could help me. Every other weekend or so I'd go see the movie. Sunday night I'd put together my resume packets and Monday I'd send them out. Shawshank reminded me that I am the captain of the ship, and that I had better get busy living or get busy dying.

In the end, none of those resumes got me what I wanted. I wound up leaving Miami on my own after eight months (but I swear, it seemed like I'd been there an eternity...) I don't know that I'd have been able to do that -- or do it that quickly -- if Shawshank hadn't come along.

I'd like to say that what I learned from Shawshank stayed with me always, but I can't. I forget. I let myself feel trapped. But then I pop this DVD in, and I remember: You are never imprisoned. You always have options. You're always in control and there's always hope.

So, to paraphrase Red, you doubters can go on and stamp your ""1"" or ""4"" rating on Shawshank if it makes you feel good to be a naysayer. I don't give a damn. I know firsthand the power of this film. It's changed my life, just as it has the lives of so many others.",9
"After reading the two tirades submitted three days-apart (May 28/03 & June 1/03), absolutely shredding this fine film I felt I had to submit my own views. Everyone is indeed entitled to their own opinions, but when so many people love this film and give it the highest kudos possible I have to wonder about the judgement of someone who gives it a zero out of ten! Shawshank has become one my personal favorites over the years and if there was an injustice done in the 1994 Oscars, it's that the film didn't win. I was surprised at the time that the voting membership gave Forest Gump the nod over Shawshank for best picture, but Gump was full of U.S. patriotism and that always goes a long way at the Oscars. The Oscar Committee should maybe check Gump's position in the IMDB top 250 list, or lack of position as the case may be. Shawshank, based on a Stephen King short story and directed by Frank Darabont (The Green Mile and The Majestic, two more of my favorites) is a very well written tale of one mans' false conviction, subsequent imprisonment and his life long crusade to gain his freedom. It is about not surrendering to the hopelessness that must overcome even the strongest of wills after decades behind bars. It is about brotherhoods and friendships bonded over decades and also about the hatreds and evil that the same elements can foster. Like the other great prison film, Cool Hand Luke, the movie takes the side of the prisoners against the system, In story the warden and head guard are portrayed as truly evil as the rapists and murderers that they hold sway over. This film indeed deserves its high position on the best of list, and in my opinion should perhaps be moved up one more notch!",10
This is a loooonnnnnggg movie but I didn't miss a second of it. Trust and friendship in such a deplorable situation is amazing. Truth can be found everything and even in through the bad. I hope to see a pt 2 of this,10
I love this movie. It had a meaning and the story was amazing. I wish it had a part 2,10
"Even before I saw this as the highest rated film on IMDB, this movie was my favorite. I remember my dad recommending it to me when I was in middle school but the cover just didn't captivate me to watch it. When I was in 7th grade it came on tv and my dad forced me to watch it. It was one of the greatest experiences of my life. Although I was young, the movie touched me in a way no other movie has been able to do. The journey of friendship, suffering, and hope can be experienced in your soul while watching. Because of this film I am now pursuing filmmaking as a career. It has changed my life.",10
"Sentimental crap! Boring, over-rated beyond belief! Don't watch it-it's crap!",10
"Redemption is a powerful tool and the dynamic tim robbins plays his character to absolute perfection. After being convicted for a crime of passion he did not commit, we follow the eyes of andy dufrane and his sometimes brutal encounters in the shawshank prison. Loss, entrapment and the powerful word 'hope' are some of the initial thoughts i have about the film, but the ending where a lanscape of the perfect shade of blue in the form of the ocean attests the beauty of this film- where there is hope and the psychological will to out- manuver the seemingly futile surrounding walls forms the heart of humanity and its existence",10
"Could not say anything , Its the best movie ever made !",10
"All time hit. Acting Level Infinity.

The only other movie i have ever seen that affects me as strongly is to kill a mockingbird.",10
When a soul is entrapped in an endless loop. you need focus and time.,10
"I enjoyed this movie, but I still regard it as one of the most vastly over-rated films of all time. The villains in the film were 2-dimensional caricatures. There were no shades of gray in this film whatsoever. I can accept such villains when some element of the fairy tale, some element of the supernatural is introduced. For instance, it was okay for Chigurh to be cartoonish in No Country For Old Men because he was clearly supposed to be a symbol, a force of nature. The warden in Shawshank Redemption, on the other hand, isn't a force of nature, merely a poorly-written character.

Honestly, the Shawshank Redemption was absorbing, but it wasn't a ""great film"" (in the capital-letters sense) by any stretch of the imagination.",10
Not good as much of the hype they give for the movie so i dont like it,10
"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs (Mark Rolston).

In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.

In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"".

In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. Red becomes concerned with Andy's state of mind, particularly when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet of rope.

The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.

After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited.",10
"The movie teaches us Patiance, Hope and true value of freedom.",10
"I was forced to give this movie a rating of 10. Because this movie is a lesson on how life itself is, it deserves much more.

The last comment poster asked who the reader's ""Andy"" was. I ask that poster who his ""Red"" is :).

A little cheeky, but an important question, because Andy always needs Red to survive and make meaning of what is around them, of what is their life. Andy is a viewer in some respects, picking up and learning and teaching in a nonchalant manner.

I also believe, perhaps, Andy and Red often exist in the one and same person.",10
"If more people would watch the Shawshank Redemption before putting on a film maker hat and providing the public with the crud that's out there, I am convinced that the world would be a much better place! This film is just simply UNREAL! Great job all around and no wonder it's in the top 5 of the IMDB's all time best 100.",10
"I have never observed such a stunning film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank envelops companionships, difficulties, expectations, and dreams. What's more, what is so extraordinary about the film is that it moves you, it gives you trust. Despite the fact that the conditions between the characters and the watchers are very extraordinary, you don't feel that far expelled from what the characters are experiencing.

It is a basic film, yet it has an everlasting message. Straightforward Darabont didn't have to put any sort of amazing enhancements to get us to cherish this film, the portrayal and the acting does that for him. Why this film didn't win every one of the seven Oscars is past me, however don't let that influence you to not see this film, let its positioning on the IMDb's main 250 rundown influence you, let your companions suggestion about the film influence you.

Put aside barely two hours today around evening time and lease this film. You will at long last comprehend what everybody is discussing and you will comprehend why this is my unequaled most loved film.",9
"In every way shape and form, through and through, the greatest movie ever. This doesn't mean my favorite. This means the art direction the music the story the acting the lighting the ect ect ect were flawless. Total package of perfection.",10
Finally understand why it's such a highly acclaimed movie. Don't bother renting it. Just buy it so you can watch it over and over again throughout your years,10
This Movie was so amazing! fo freakin awsome! i watch it more then 1 times in years.,10
"I find it amazing that a film like this rates so highly on the IMDb Top 250.

It's not really a 'cinematic' film like LOTR or Star Wars- you don't look at it and go 'wow, what an amazing shot!' or 'how did they do that?'. Similarly, it's not chock-full of catch-phrases and snappy dialogue like 'Pulp Fiction', 'Casablanca', or indeed memorable scenes like 'the Godfather'. Could anyone really talk about 'Shawshank' in the way that people always discuss 'the Godfather' or 'LOTR'- ""remember that moment when...""

'Shawshank' isn't a big, spectacular film, and nor is it particularly witty.

Instead, its success is entirely down to the quality of the story, helped along by some very 'real' acting. I've now seen this film 4-5 times on odd occasions, and it just gets better every time. The story just draws you in- you feel for the characters, and I love the way the surprise (well, surprise-ish) ending is perfectly believable without ever being overtly signposted. I've heard that it's been much more successful on DVD and video than it was at the cinema- and I think that illustrates the type of movie it is.

'Shawshank' is perhaps the best 'story' movie of recent times, and clearly deserves its place near the top of the IMDb rankings. Watch it curled up on the couch with a cup of coffee and a warm cosy wife...",10
"An excellent movie, viewers look like they follow the story.",10
this is truly a masterpiec of acting and storytelling and it is one of my favorites. It has such an amazing and powerful story of friendship and survival and that ending! a tad sentimental but so what! a movie like this needs to be sentimental. It cheers me up everytime i see it,10
A perfect storytelling with the best actors created a legendary movie. I'm glad I watched this movie.,10
The best movie ever made. Perfecto. Andy duffreine is the ma,10
"Very well done movie although I don't think it's as good as everybody says... One of the better movies I have watched and it is absolutely worth looking at it, no doubt! Unfortunately I don't like it so much anymore. That can depend on the amount of times I have watched it over the years at school etc. and it has gradually become a little more boring and I don't enjoy it as other movies like Batman. As a Tarantino fan I like more brutality in movies than drama. The actors, story and the quotes in the movie is a big plus though! If you like movies or TV-series that is inside a prison I strongly recommend the TV-series ""Prison Break"". Well, back to the topic. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that is worth watching. If you haven't seen it before it will be a very good movie to watch with your family or friends. As I said earlier I don't like it that much these days but it feels more like it's not really my cup of tea... I give it a 9 out of 10, fare and square. /Andreas Flink",10
"This movie has changed my life, I started seeing things differently. It's a must watch for everyone. It's not just a 2 hour time pass , its way more than that. Definitely the best thing I ever saw.",10
"This movie is about the former banker who was falsely imprisoned. He was suspected of murder (As you can see in the trailer). This movie describes the mind of prisoners, and situations in prison.

Prisoners, especially those who get life imprisonment, are not able to live normally. They will get crazy because there's no hope for them. Even if they are able to get paroled, they can't find hope in their new life. For them, the life in prison is everything. They don't know how they live outside. But the man, Andy (main character) was different. He never give up hope. Hope often cut us. If we don't have hope, we don't get hurt. If we expect nothing, we don't have to get disappointed. Prisoners know this, and try not to have hope. But he try to keep it. His attitude gave me strong message.

Also this movie tells us how human lights are ignored in the prison. Some people might think it's natural that prisoners don't have human right. They don't deserve for it. But what if there are some prisoners who are falsely imprisoned and are innocent? I watched this movie thinking of the human rights of criminals and how warden should treat them.

This is written by Stephen King, and his story is so beautiful. Also actors are great. I recommend this movie to everyone!",10
"This movie is the first in the top 250 list and I agree that it's a masterpiece. The actors chosen were incredible and the whole story was extremely interesting and involving. However, there were few flaws. In my opinion, the movie needed more action. Even thought the tension and action was building up as the minutes passed, it was not growing fast enough and after some time it get a little boring. Thankfully, the ending is astonishing and it makes you forget all the bad things that happened before in the movie. It can easily be labeled as that 'unique prison movie' which will never be over-passed in this category because there's never going to me a movie like this. There's no doubt that Morgan Freeman is the hero of the film with his acting and effort. In the end, the movie is a real masterpiece but I cannot call it the best movie ever made.",10
Harika bir filmdi Harika bir filmdi Harika bir filmdi Harika bir filmdi,10
beautiful overhead shot of prison. Roger Deakins is a god. king has never been treated so soft or tenderly. dialogue is sentimental. Too so? yeah. music is smooth and sweet. the over-all posture stood is unexpectedly tough. green mile was a sad shadow of this previous vastly superior effort.the Brooks Hatlen interlude was a welcome beat. meandering is a virtue. i get lost in it's world for a sec. which is rare. the ending makes me cry. freeman is an exceedingly wonderful actor. strange feelings of elation near ending as if something has occurred. Things which haven't. magic of pure Hollywood-style cinema. samo,9
"I would only put this movie behind the LOTR trilogy (I consider them one movie). It is a great tale and even though you know something good will happen, you don't know exactly how, though when looking back it was pretty clear. I value movies by how entertaining and captivating they are. This one was both. Many people like to put on their ""film-maker"" hats too much. This movie doesn't really show great symbolism or tricky camera work. Its just a very good story with very good acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are unreal, and all the supporting characters (Brooks, the prison guards, etc.) make the film complete. It took my a long time to see this movie, even though its on TNT and TBS like every weekend. I must say I was thrilled. Just excellent. 10/10 easy.",10
I have never seen such an interesting film . A must watch for all,10
this has been said so many times before i may be mad watching this at alow ebb this film works for heart and soul of the individual watching this film is utter perfection and yet immediately after watching this i watched EDUCATING RITA now call me mad but i found these films quite similar in a way that RITA is also a prisoner trapped by her life surroundings wanting to become educated her motto as well is GET BUSY LIVING OR GET BUSY DYING back to shawshank this film is as i said pure perfection if you havent seen it WHY ?,10
"This is just world class!! The acting is brilliant, the story is brilliant and the time went to fast. Seen it lots of times",10
"But for me this is my second favorite film of all time. Some just think it's too sentimental in some areas, but I just don't agree. Sure, Frank Darabont may have had a one time hit from a Stephen King novel, but what he was able to do with this character driven compelling story truly amazes me. The movie gets me every time, draws me in and holds me there. The use of voice-over is used so well in this movie and the range of emotion from Morgan Freeman's character just astonishes me.

It follows twenty years of the Red character, played by Morgan Freeman and it chronicles his life in a maximum-security prison and how one Andy Dufresne affects his life played brilliantly by Tim Robbins. Now, some may argue with me that it is Tim Robbins movie, but I would have to disagree since the character that goes through the acceptance and the change throughout the story is Red. This is the one movie where you could really have two leads, two protagonists, because they are both developed so well and their relationship is so fascinating to watch.

I never tire of this movie. The end monologue still makes me tear up every time, and it doesn't matter if I watched the movie all the way through, or if I just popped in for the last few minutes on TBS. It is such a masterfully told story of redemption and hope that if you love storytelling, you will love this movie. I love movies from every era, but this and Rushmore are my two favorite movies of all time. Without a doubt!",10
"Whenever this movie comes on I have to watch it and I love it every time. This movie is not a depressing movie overall and even though there are sad moments in the movie; there is also has a lot of humor about life as well. The warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red is what make this movie so great. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. The redemption and friendship theme of this movie is what makes it easy for us all to easily identify with these characters and evoke such emotions while we watch for the first time or the 20th + times you see it Like myself.",10
truly one of the best movie i have ever seen.....the acting of Morgan freeman is outstanding as it always is....also Tim Robbins has done nice work......the plot of the movie is very enjoying and won't let you get sleepy..the movie is very much interesting at all times and most of the time you cant predict what's going to happen...also the cast of the movie is very appropriate.when i watched the movie i was truly amazed by the story and no matter its the best movie of all time....also the direction of Frank Darabont is really worth appreciating...as his direction made the movie really awesome...the movie again is truly worth watching....i enjoyed watching this movie and hope you guys enjoy it too....,10
"When viewers see a young banker's character (Dufresne) convicted of a gruesome murder, and later when they see him vindicate himself with the help of pure courage and hope, it evokes high emotions like triumph and hope. Each scene is skillfully written with viewers' perspective considered all through the film. Excellent work due to which Frank Darabont never need prove himself as a director again, because this one goes down in the history books as one of the best dramas ever written.

Dufresne's character does what's on his mind says and never shows feelings of captivity while at Shawshank. The character is carved out meticulously displaying traits like intelligence and a mind determined to survive

Morgan Freeman ('Red') delivers a brilliant performance, deserving the Academy Award that year which ultimately landed up with Tom Hanks ('Forrest Gump').",10
"Nobody can deny that The Shawshank Redemption is a good, maybe even great movie. But I think it's overrated. I understand it might touch many peoples feelings, but the movie feels like it is just too clearly designed to evoke those feelings. It is a movie that takes ones hand and tells the viewer a clearly defined, well structured story that follows all the standard story beats one would expect from a prison drama. The fact that this movie has gotten so much praise just goes to show that Hollywood got all the rules of filmmaking figured out. This movie followed those rules to the letter and got tremendous success because of that. In short, the movie succeeds in what it aimed to do. Evoke symphaty where symphaty's due and evoke anger where anger is due. It helps that its very well made and edited.

My gripe with this film is that it didn't do anything new. There is no message left open for interpretation, there is no real meaning behind the cinematography and the music and voice over are quite generic (I love Freeman's voice but it's overdone in this film). When I watch a film I want the story to be shown, not told.",10
After you finish this film you will set in front of your screen and your tongue will get stunned you will feel that the world doesn't exist and the film will control your brain as a toy this is a film combining thinking great emotions and the unexpected and traitors some gun shooting some comedy if I would do something I would go to the creators of the film and make them some status and write there names in the books of history . Morgan freeman played acted the film of his life All cast are masters they did deal with black magic or something if you didn't see that movie go buy it's DVD right now or I will come and kill you for not seeing that master piece,10
"this movie teach us about life,hope,dream,freedom ...diaouge of the movie are more and more effective.a sweet voice of Morgan freeman is amazing and Tim Robbins gave best performance of his career.brooks also a fantastic character..i watched this movie at first time at the age of 19 ..in this year 2013..it is still amazing and best after 20 years of its released. ONE WORD i will watch it still last time of my life...GREAT MOVIE THE SHAWSHANK AND REDEMPTION.story line of it is fantastic.directorial part also best and the musics or background musics it is just no word.one scene of movie i alway want to see is oak tree scene. a line ""remember red :hope is a good thing,may be the best of things and no good thing ever dies.",10
"The movie really seems to have moved me. Its a Story that arouses hope within an individual. it reminds me of the famous lines from the a great poem that ""when winter comes spring cant be far behind"".

The movie revolves around the two character Andrew Dufresne and Red. Andy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realizes there is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and get to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan Freeman), and Andy epitomizes why it is crucial to have dreams. His spirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination, filled with courage and desire. This is about how he spreads his message of hope through the Shashank Redemption!!!

A must watch!! although it may don't seem so great at the beginning but the ending is marvelous which makes it a masterpiece!!! Do watch it....",10
"If I had to choose top 3 movies of all-time that I have watched, I would surely include this movie in that list. Such an original & realistic performances. Great movie. A must watch before you die!",10
"Although the acting and directing was brilliant, the movie retained a somewhat unrealistic vibe. There is a very low chance that one will find as many civilized friends and people in a maximum security prison. There was no sign of any violent or aggressive behavior in many of the inmates. The only thing that reflected real prison life were the cells and the sisters. Do not take this wrong. I loved the movie immensely. It showed great imprisonment and in many ways was realistic. The acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was perfect. The institutionalization of Brooks was very well portrayed. This movie had many great factors but not completely perfect. Overall I give this movie a 8.5.",10
"""A long road to freedom, a washing in the depths of the soul, an immortal inspirational classic, ""Hope"" follows God's will to sleep peacefully in the ""Bible"" hollowed out on the inner page, attached to Andy's tall body , Crawling in the 500-yard sewer, and finally, the only dirty road sent Andy to a beautiful new world. This journey of despair and heavy redemption comes from the infamous Shawshank prison, from thriller novels The original work of master Stephen King and the devoted work of philosophical director Dara Bonte. ""The Redemption of Shawshank"" brings constant and sincere friendship, persevering soul casting and endless fire of destiny. Hope does not require enthusiasm, and passionate hope is just an inadvertent impulse in the soul. In prison, when the process of life can only be measured by time, any high enthusiasm can only helplessly raise his hands to despair. Accept the arrangement of fate. Only people with a clear heart can see the absurdity of life, otherwise, people can only feel wronged and helpless when faced with injustice, angry and violent when faced with repression, rot in dilemma, or even in the ordinary environment. Loneliness and despair. Cowardly imprisoned the soul, hoping to feel freedom.",10
Incredible movie. Very well interpreted and produced. It is a masterpiece.,10
"Andy Dufresne: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.

Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane.

Andy Dufresne: That's the beauty of music. They can't get that from you... Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

Red: We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

this is the first time i am really wand to write something about this movie even though i have watched it a hundred times, I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last, It has everything you could possibly wan, This film has had such an emotional impact on me.

I can't remember how I ended up watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it's been many years. I can't remember how many times I have watched it, I have seen this movie about 20 times and I get stunned every time.",9
This is easily the best movie I have ever seen. It wasn't a box office smash but it came on later and has become one of those rare films that will be talked about for generations. Tim Robbins is masterful as Andy Dufresne.,10
"To anyone that says Forrest Gump was the best movie then you are insane. The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever watch. It doesn't have any problems whatsoever. While Morgan Freeman takes most of the attention, Tim Robbins was absolutely incredible. The Movies overall message is inspiring and is one that will truly make you smile. The movie is long but it is just the length that it needs to be and won't bother you. What sets this movie apart though is the acting. The acting was on a level I don't think we have seen since. The movie is one of the best of all time and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good story",9
"It is hard to believe the one place to find hope and inspiration comes from a prison drama. Yet, regardless of this fact, it is a life changer; true awe inspired amazing film, it explores the true meaning of being a human and, beyond that the truth behind friendship. This is ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

In a nutshell, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the story of Mr. Andy Dufresne and his journey to reach the films title: redemption. A man accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. He is shipped to Shawkshank Prison, in Maine, to spend the rest of his life. Over the next 10-20-30 years, he finds his way to peace, truth and holds onto great hope in the midst of the terror of the prison system.

The performances in the film is top notch. Andy is played perfectly by Mr. Tim Robbins. The true hero in this piece is ""Red"" by the one and the only Morgan Freeman. He narrates the film and shows the development of each character, and above all characters he changes the most. Considering he is one of the oldest characters, he contradicts the old saying of ""you cannot teach a old dog new tricks"". Change is always possible, to those that are willing and hold on to hope. Another character that is beautifully painted is that of Brooks, who has been in the prison the longest and has really known nothing else. He has become ""institutionalized"", and has intern lost hope for the future and his life.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those films that is a true work of both art and magic. It is a perfectly painted picture of a man who will not reliquish the only thing someone cannot directly take away: hope. From first shot of Shawshank prison - an utterly Gothic structure that permeates you with a sense of just how frightening the prison will be - you are enveloped inside of the world of Shawshank. You experience a prison life composed of routine after routine after routine after routine.

The remarkable staying power of this film is visible with every new shot in the film. It is able to sustain itself throughout its duration and to keep you enraptured with its remarkable hopeful story.

It seems important to write this review now, in a low point of my life, and watching the movie (quiet a few times) I have realized new and important points of the film. It has uplifted me and gave me hope, however in different ways then it did when I first saw it in early 2000's.

In the end, this is one of those movies that need to be seen by all.

""Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""",10
"Ill make this short. I got two versions of this DVD in my collection, in case one of them gets broken.

Excellent acting by Robbins and Freeman, plus all the other bi-characters. Thomas Newman's music in the background makes the moments so sore and intense that you forget everything else. Some critics might say its a sentimental cry-baby movie, but forget about it. Ask the biggest moron you can find on a monster-bike and ill bet he remembers this movie.

If you haven't seen the movie, go see it. If you have seen it, go see it again.",6
"I know tons of people have commented on this masterpiece already but I feel the need to make another one. First of all the plot, the conclusion, the acting, and the narration are classic. Morgan Freeman can make a movie just with his voice (but for the record this movie is so good it doesn't need it).

There's no action or explosions just great actors committing to their roles and making it seem as if you know the characters personally.

When I had just finished watching this the other night, I started watching Family Guy and a joke about Andy Dufresne and the sisters came on. Although I didn't find it to be very funny I thought to myself ""Hey I know that movie!""

When I finished watching it I thought about how it good it was and how it made me feel about myself for a good day and a half.

If you like movies that are not just put out to entertain watch this movie, trust me you won't be disappointed.",10
"I've read the short story by Stephen King, I've seen the stage play and, of course, I've seen the film, I would say this, read the short story, don't bother with the play but, whatever you do, see this film. It really is a timeless classic. Obviously the characters and time line are a bit out which is why it helps to read the short story but that doesn't detract from the film whatsoever, so well made and acted.",10
I had not watched this is such a long time and forgotten much of the story and sat down to watch it this evening and forgot how flawless a film this is.,10
"Must watch movie.... Ultimate screenplay...

TIM Robins superb.. A masterpiece from Frank Darabont ... this moviemade ma day....... the one of the most intelligent movie ever saw.. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years. Stephen King""s novel adaption best movie... Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It tells a lesson about life. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me.... It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances.",10
"At first I thought this will be a movie about some guy in prison who faces problems and overcomes with his goodness.I want to skip watching it(because I don't watch movies giving messages which are not possible practically).If I would have done that, my life would not be as great as it is now.It changed my life a lot by making me believe in hope.

I suggest every human needs to watch this movie. No wonder it is top movie of all time.It shows the power of hope.Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman brings life to their characters.I haven't seen any Frank Darabont movies but I can say it was his best.

If you are in bad phase of your life, I suggest SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. It will help you a lot psychologically.You wouldn't understand what I said till the end of movie. Watch it as soon as possible.",10
"The great words spoken by Andy to Red. Never give up. Shawshank is a movie based on a book by Stephen King. When I tell people this it is hard for them to believe. This is the best adaptation of a King story that he has not written the screenplay for. Even though some of the characters in the movie don't fit the descriptions from the story they work.

The movie shows the life of a prisoner convicted of a crime that he says he did not commit and the great friendship he develops with Red and the daily problems a prisoner faces. This is a great story and I never get tired of watching it. I have seen it 30 times and it gets better every time.

Get busy living or get busy dying.",10
"After watching this movie, I was deeply shocked by the scenic: an old man, who was just released from the prison not ling before, ended his valued life by a rope. What put him into despair after all?? I wonder.

The old man, like most prisoners there, was eager for freedom at the first minutes he was put into the prison. Now getting rid of the terrible life , he should be happy and grateful .however , when he set his feet first on the land outside the prison gate, he stood for a short while and watched around with the expression of confusion and suspicion on his wrinkling face before setting off. I can imagine what his reaction was. ¡°Is it the same world before I was sent into the prison?¡± no! Everything is rather strange to him as if he was a UFO.

He went into the prison as a young man and came out as an old man. He was used to living in the world surrounded by four high and thick walls. Everything was done as told .No choices, no rights. Although he was a free man now, what could an old man do to survive himself in the world full of intensive competition? Long years¡¯ stay in the prison made him an impotent man. How could he develop new abilities to keep pace of times? NO one understood him and showed sympathy on him, but blamed him for his clumsiness and sluggishness. nobody paid attention to him and cared about him. What a lonely man!!! No wonder that the old man felt himself useless and helpless and committed suicide.

At this point, I can not help asking one question. Who pleads guilty or who is responsible for this matter? Maybe you will say it is none of your business. Is it only the old man¡¯s personal affairs? Do governments or the authorities set the institutes like prisons for the purpose to let those who commit crimes have the chance to turn a new leaf of their life? Undoubtfully. But why do they reject again and again those who have realized their guilt and decided to lead a new life? It is clear that they do not want to free any prisoner until all are too old to contribute to society. What a satire!!!

This film reflects such a phenomenon, which should be paid special attention to not only by the authorities but also by ordinary citizens.",10
"This is certainly a good movie, but it's not the greatest movie of all time. People hype up this movie too much which persuades other people to develop the same opinion as them. When people are asked what their favourite movie is, they often reply with Shawshank because they don't want to be seen to have a different opinion from the norm. People should develop their own opinions. It's good to see that critics don't rate this film as highly as the general public - I guess this proves that critics truly do know more about movies than the amateurs who consider this film to be the greatest of all time. I also found this film fairly predictable as it was obvious that he would escape in the end.",7
"A must watch movie. Redefines the emotions like hope and trust etc. The character of Morgan Freeman is also fantastic. Got to know what prison is . Life Sentence is one of the most torturous Punishment one can get. The planning process of the escape is just mind boggling. But I still can't believe that a person can keep his hope for this long. Al though I doubt that in 19 years, his cell was not changed. But of course this movie was released way back in 1994. Got to know much about American prison and prisoner- maintenance system that existed then. Morgan Freeman plays his character well and so does Tim. every part of the movie will be well understood as the movie progresses. Its a long but interesting movie. After all, these many internet reviewers cant be wrong. But it is not the best movie of all times.",8
"What a wounderfull movie. Great. This story, complete with the Oscar winning performances in both acting and special effects is perfect for those in need of a dose of goodness. My family enjoys watching Forrest Gump together for rejuvenation, to view someone with true values of honesty, friendship and family. Forrest, with his heart of gold and his low IQ, never gives up. He always looks for the best in every scenario. The movie opens with a feather floating down over the city, landing at Forrest's feet. Near the end of the story, Forrest questions, ""Do we each have a destiny - or do we just float around accidental, like on a breeze?"" As you are contemplating this question, the feather reappears and floats through the countryside right up into the ending credits.",5
"im Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....

I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.",10
"Hope........ Like water and air is important for life Hope Is important for how u want live your life So Don't Loose is up and a must watch movie for every human the best star cast the best writer the best director this movie hasn't win Oscar but it will win your heart please watch its gonna change your life The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.",9
"Now writing a review to read for around 1 million viewers who have already watched the movie may sound foolish. But since I am on a big mood swing of excitement, I am writing it. Some movies never get old. Some reasons are no use of technology, never fading human feelings, universally accepted ground concepts, etc. So, maybe because of these reasons, The Shawshank Redemption seems to have found its way to the Top Alltime 250 Movies in this website. Overall, the movie made my day. In fact it made my whole year. The main actor of the movie is no less than any super hero. Also you ought to believe that these kind of people, these kind of incidents do happen in the real world. Although may not with these kind of drama. But, you can say, they do. I really regret that this movie did not earn much during its initial time of release. A Straight sweep Full 10.",10
"You will see everything in this movie, TOP i recommended",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is my favourite movie of all time. Why? Well as you can see it is third now in the list of IMDb.com top movies ever and is praised by actually everyone i've talked about it and every critic. But that's not me. Everyone can have their say and mine is that big part of this movies high quality comes from the everlasting theme of hope and of the fact that the filmmakers can make you like and even love the characters, though they are murderers, thieves and so on. That is hard to achieve and it is a remarkable mistake not to have honored the best adapted screenplay Oscar to this movie. Best picture also would have been the right choice(though it would have been fun to see Pulp Fiction win). And of course not only the movie's acting is perfect everything else is in it's superb place too. The music, the cinematography etc.

What happens is that, to ME, this movie is perfect. It's got everything a movie need and then some(and more). Maybe you can say it's caused bit of the hype of everyone saying it is such great movie, but I can't deny it's place on example in this list, and nor can I say that it is overrated. So if you haven't seen it(and you propably have) the watch it as soon as you can! You just must...",10
"Central to the film's success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally. There are times when The Shawshank Redemption comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. As the uptight banker, Robbins does some of his subtlest acting to date. As his hardened but resilient friend, Freeman is simply miraculous, giving the role so much depth, dignity, and good humor that you feel that you've known this man forever. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. When I was younger I would always see this movie playing on various channels and always wondered why. What made this movie so special? Well, the answer is pretty much everything in this movie is special, from the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose characters are really fleshed out in subtle ways to the overall themes that have made the movie so watchable ever since it was first released. There is a reason this movie is still being played on channels to this day! If you have not seen this movie, than go watch it immediately! You wont regret it.",10
"I regret that I only watched this movie 5 years ago because it is a masterpiece!! It doesn't deserve a 10/10, it deserves an 11/10.

It's about a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. He befriends a fellow inmate (Morgan Freeman)

The whole movie you will be captivated. The acting is superb.. The two leads Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are incredible. The other prisoners are excellent too and Gil Robbins is super special.

I have seen this movie so many times and still to this day every time I watch it, I am in awe.

Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. Spectacular movie!!",10
"Whilst I respect the opinions of others and enjoy reading a variety of contrasting reviews, I find it surprising that the Shawshank Redemption has been voted the greatest film of all time.

I enjoyed watching this film and feel that the story is generally good and the cast is excellent, resulting in distinct and complex characters whilst providing an interesting insight into the mentality and inter- relationship of prisoners and guards. However, I don't feel that the story was challenging, the concept is not particularly original and borders cliché when considering other prison films, the film is, in my view, unnecessarily long and, crucially, I didn't like the ending.

I do feel that this is still a very good film, however there are other films, indeed other prison films, which are better than this one.",9
"What can you say, this movie is one of my favorites. I have to watch it every time it comes on TV. I love it!",5
I love this movie son much. It ages well And have a great cast.,5
"The Shawshank Redemption is a good movie. It has a good story and good acting. Though I don 't think that the movie is good enough to be at the top of the 250 list at IMDb. I think that it is a great ""prison movie"" but it's so similar to other books and movies like Midnight Express or The Escape From Alcatraz. A ""prison movie"" that is much better but doesn't get the glory and credibility is The Green Mile witch made me more emotional and excited. Compared with The Shawshank Redemption, The Green mile has a better storyline and most important an original prison story.

The Shawshank Redemption is about man called Andy who is being wrongly accused for a crime that he didn't do. He was given two life sentences for killing his wife and her lover in cold blood. Therefore he is being sent to Shawshank Prison. Andy learns to adapt to prison life and he meets knew friends, but also enemies. The life in prison is hard and he meets a lot of obstacles as the story goes.

As I said earlier, it is a good movie and you should see it if you haven't. However in my opinion it is too unoriginal and safe for the best film in history as many other think. By saying safe I mean that the director could have done something that had made me remember the film. Something out of the ordinary. Instead of the ""escape prison"" unoriginality. Cause now I think it's just a bland movie.

Another thing that I think the movie misses is more fighting and crime. Isn't this a prison? Should it not have any sort of violent behavior? Sure Andy fights of a bunch of enemies in a few short scenes, but I don't think that that's enough. The thing is that Andy's enemies are the only bad guys in the whole movie. At least of what we see in this film. The film could have exploited more violence and crime, but instead we get a nice old man that feeds his bird. Andy's friends are so nice that I sometimes feel like they are workmates instead of committed criminals. When they are out in the yard all convicts are just playing ball and talking like they are having a lunch brake. I don't mean that all prisoners should just fight and swear but it could have least been one fight seen in the yard so you get a bit more of that prison feeling.

In conclusion it's a good movie with some flaws. It's has many good scenes. Though in my opinion it fails because of its blandness and unoriginality. They should have put more effort in making something more memorable.

Based on my judgment it's a 8/10 and I think that it's a fare rating. It should have its title in the top 250, but not the number one.

//Swedish Critic",10
It's the best plot ever this film is one of the best films that made my day i watched it over 20 times and i learned many things from it every time i watched it,10
"An absolutely mind-blowing film about hope being with you no matter what the situation may be.Just because the movie is about the prison life,you may be fooled into thinking that it is about the horrors and the fear and the hopelessness of the life.But it is in fact exactly the opposite of that.This is a film that tells us that no matter what the situation may be,no matter what happens,there is always hope left with you and it is something which no one can take from you.

It is a film that defines originality and perfection at that.Even though Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) was given life sentence,it was his belief that he is innocent that kept him from breaking down.It was hope that finally saved him.

""In prison,most people would do just about anything to keep themselves busy.Some made house of cards.some collected stamps.Andy built a library.""These were the words of Red(Morgan Freeman).What he said was true.

Among all the movies I've seen,i truly believe that this is the best one out of all of them.So if any one of you have'nt seen this film,go watch it and be utterly amazed at it's perfection and storyline.",9
I've watched this movie at least once a year since 1994!,10
"This movie should have won all the Oscars in 1994 (Forrest Gump won) but we all believe The Shawshank Redemption deserved better. Tim Robbins played the meticulous character like no one could have. The story has a catch (the escape) but it's not about the escape. It's about hope. Morgan Freeman is a tremendous supporting actor, although I believe his role was no less important.

The movie's first part is confusing until you get to the middle of the movie. During the entire first half you sit wondering what's the point of all this. Yet you are glued because you hope there is something. By the time movie enters second part you feel 'man i should have been in that prison' There is no villain in the movie, everyone's just a character. It's no good boys winning over bad boys. But yet at the end of the movie you feel triumphant.

Many people don't know about this movie because of the nature of the story. But then those who know, know too well. No wonder this movie is top rated at IMDb, that is a good enough compliment to the director, script and the actors. Oscar isn't the end of the world.",9
"One of the best movies I have ever seen, I can watch this every few months or so and still enjoy it.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.

Although the film was a box office disappointment, it received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It is now considered to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).[4]

In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".",6
"I saw this film back in '95 in Romania. Funny thing - it's translated title there was ""Angels' Prison""...I don't if it's the best ever made, for sure it's the one I liked the most. the film is about friendship - one thing who became pretty rare nowadays - and is simply magic, don't have any other words to add except that I've logged in on IMDb' site just to be able to vote and make sure it stays no. ONE. So it had 7 Oscar nominations, walked away with nothing. That tells me nothing folks, I only remember the emotions I experienced when I saw it. I'am not a touchy one but Shawshank did it for me, big time. And one final word, please don't forget Stephen King in all this, just because he had commercial success doesn't mean he's not great.",8
"So in the beginning I wasn't anticipated to watch this movie. I judged it would be slow, uninteresting, and overrated with people jumping the bandwagon of how good it was. But as I was seeing how the movie was unfolding, I was surprised to see how interesting it really was. There wasn't a dull moment of it. I was pleased with how the ending made me feel. I think the big thing about this movie is how it captures your emotions. The actors were great, and the story was great too. Overall I give it a 9.5. But I do think this is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It is definitely in my top three. Don't let the title stop you from watching it if it sounds boring to you. This is a movie I would watch over and over again. It does live up to the hype.",10
"Give me so much hope, meaningful scenes, the best drama ever Give me so much hope, meaningful scenes, the best drama ever Give me so much hope, meaningful scenes, the best drama ever.",10
Without a doubt the best movie ever made. Not one single flaw in all of the categories. I wish I could watch this everyday like it is my first time... Thank you to all cast and crew. I miss my friend...,9
"Like some other reviewers, I had avoided watching this: jail movies, Stephen King ( and don't get me wrong - I really like his novels and the films esp The Shining - even though he hated Kubrick's version - but I had an expectation of his work which was counter to what makes a 'universal' movie).

Eventually, by accident, I had it on in the background on a UK digital channel, but in about 10 minutes in I stopped doing what I was doing and watched it.

There's no point in my trying to add much to the thousands of words that have been written about this - all I know is that it touched me deeply - and in a way that I thought an all male cast and plot setting couldn't do. A truly beautiful, thought provoking and 'moral tale'.

If there is anyone one out there who still haven't seen this - I really suggest that you do so. I simply can't believe that it barely recovered budget in the 90's when it was first released.

I think it is one of the most exceptionally brilliant movies Hollywood has ever produced.

Morgan Freeman was brilliant, of course, but it is an ensemble piece: the whole is much much greater than its parts.",10

"If you are a casual movie watcher, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie that has most definitely been splattered smugly all over your computer screen. If one were to quickly google ""Top 100 Movies of All Time"", I can guarantee this movie will be on that list. However, is this movie worth the recognition and critical acclaim?

The short answer is: yes. Of course.

THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION takes the qualities of a standard film and ups the game drastically. Loving characters? Check. Well-shot iconic scenes? Yep, it also has that. An unforgettable quirky narrative? You betcha.

Now, given my rating of a 9, I obviously did not find this movie to be a somewhat modern masterpiece. (This calls for a re-watch so I can reform or reinforce my views) However, is it irrational to call this the best movie of the 90s? No, it's actually completely understandable. Is it irrational to call this the best movie of all time? Again, nope - it is completely understandable and logical that someone would view the movie in that light.

+ classic narrative

+ lovable characters

+ emotional / thought-provoking in some sense

-none

"What can I say, it is films like this that just give you that great feeling. This is a perfect film for themes such as hope, friendship, freedom and corruption. Now for those who have not seen the film I won't say anything, so do not worry, but just to tell you. If you are into the themes I have just mentioned, then you will love this. Tim Robbins adopts the role of Andy Dufresne as his own and Morgan freeman plays Red in an emotional and convincing manner and really did shine throughout the film. So if you want to see a film thats emotional, intellectual, violent and warden smashing, then this film is for you. It will give you chills.",10

All i'll say is that this film deserves the #1 spot (on IMDb), the story, characters are some of cinemas most realistic and the last 3rd, leaves you high on hopes and great heartfelt joy. This made me even shed a few tears.

I'm very pleased i saw this film, and respect it as it should be, one of the all time best.",10
"This film touches me. I believe it's the greatest film because I has an effect on people's lives. We watch a lot of films everyday but hardly we refer back to them.

This is a film I apply in everyday life. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. The part I liked most is when Red said ""some birds are not meant to be caged; they'll fly away and when they do, that part of you that knows it was a sin to have locked them up does rejoice...""

Indeed we should build our lives such that circumstances cannot cage us. All the while Andy was in the prison, his mind was outside.

Indeed, salvation lies within....",10

Bollywood sucks... Hollywood rocks...Bollywood is such a crap. Hollywood got Mind Bollywood got relatives.superb movie.,10
"Having watched it too many times, I still find myself thrilled and touched by it. I do not see it as a film ""made in prison"" but more like ""in life"". It is the strength underneath that makes you what you are. Sometimes it needs more than a good director, a writer or an effective cast to create a masterpiece. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", for me, has it all! ... First Morgan Freeman and then Tim Robbins, push us towards a world made of realism, darkness, acceptance and redemption, and finally victory over those who believe that power over other people makes them powerful... such a joke indeed. I really believe that one must watch this film at least one time. There will be much to learn.",9
"I have lost count of how many times I've watched ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but every time I do, it never fails to impress me. This movie has become a timeless classic that I keep going back to again and again.

The story follows Andy Dufresne, a man wrongly convicted of murder and sent to prison. Over the years, he forms a bond with Red, a fellow inmate, and the two work together to try and prove Andy's innocence. The acting in this movie is simply outstanding, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman delivering unforgettable performances.

What I love most about this movie is its message of hope and redemption. It shows that no matter how dire the circumstances, there is always a glimmer of hope. The direction and pacing are perfect, and the score by Thomas Newman is unforgettable.",10

"if your looking for a really moving deep story line. with much discovery of the human life and journey to over coming obstacles and much of what fine filming is all about. this is your ticket to Shawshank Redemtion. i highly recommend this to all those of Morgan freeman lovers. and as well prison stories. this moving will get you moving in places you never thought of. and keeps you thinking to the very end. and how as humans what do you have to do to fit in life. from my overall experience watching this film. all the emotions and right hit points that deliver this masterful work piece of art. it really defines movie making and turning points of life. i only wish that more film can at least get as close to this now a days. hope that you find everything your into looking for in this film. like i did, and took from it and made an enjoyment out of it. =]",8
"This movie is in so much depth.this is the best and will be the best movie of all time.The direction , the acting and the way music was played and how slowly the suspense was build throws light upon why this is ranked 1 in IMDb list.Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.Get busy living, or get busy dying.These quotes are so damn good.Andy: Here's where it makes the most sense. You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a – there's a – there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.",9
"This film is very overrated by seemingly sensible people. It is a remarkably emotional film on a par with various pulpy Catherine Cookson films. Talking of pulp, Pulp Fiction is awesome in comparison, as is The Shining. That Shawshank is voted Number One on many movie charts, is absolute madness. I have seen it on various occasions and via various media. And I cannot work out why people have it in such high regard. Over. Rated. Fact. Also, the film has no air of being cool or stylish in any way - it has no wow-factor of great cinematography in the way a film like Let The Right One In has for example. It has no black humour. It is tame by comparison to other films. It has no astounding scenes which Pulp Fiction has by the truckload. It has no atmosphere which a film like The Shining has by the snow-plough load. Shawshank at Number One - Absolute Madness.",7
"I took a course of film criticism and it was a requirement to watch a film called ""The Shawshank Redemption"". My first thought was quite negative because it was an old movie made in 1994. However, after I watched it yesterday, it was so impressive.

The Shawshank Redemption is a story about Andy Dufresne who is a banker was convicted of murdering his wife so he was caught to the fictional shaw shank stage. Things that happened in shaw shank were terrible but he had a friend named ""Red"" who always supported him. Moreover, he was a genius person so he did everything he could to make things better. In fact, every single thing that he has done, he did it in purpose. And that consequence was over my expectation.

What I like most is the story line and the plot was perfect. I really like how the story has been laid out and it always surprised me. You cannot guess what will happen next or even why the character does such things. Furthermore, I really like the main characters; Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, because their acts were so natural",10
"I had a chance to check the list of movie top 250 and this film is on the top of the list with high ratings.

It's about man who got arrest cause convicted of murder his own wife. He got a life imprison that had change his whole life. He struggles with living and dealing with new life. He started to adjust himself with other especially with one who turns out to be his friend.

I admire the way that film represents life deeply and give various dimensions. I saw main character thinking contradict with other. It does show violence and rude of life but give good thought.

In my opinion, after I watched this film. I have no doubt why it's on the top list. It gives lot of thought and show various dimension of life.",8
"I think everyone who saw this movie will like it. If you are director or director photography, this is the best technique of camera shot. It looks like a easy shot but it will be great. Some shot in this movie i think it will use after effects for making that shot but in that time i think adobe just was born. Thus the director of this movie is intelligent. He can make a lot of technique in that time but some shot has a mistake. We will can observe some shot is not real or unusual. I think overall are great. I copy some technique to improve my film too. The actors of movie are smart. They make the audience believe with their acting. I love it too much.",9
"So why am I posting a review now, pity me because I just acknowledge this film a while from my film class. As the same as other review I was moved by this film, this movie affects me strongly that even I watch it over and over again. I've always have the impression of the first time seen.

The best thing is you have to prepare to be moved by the hopes that emerged in this story, no special effects or tricks. This is just plain simple and impressive by its owns way portraits the very common life of men. In such despair , its amazing that when you watch this movie you can taste the freedom. The strong power of hope and determination will blow your mind.

So no doubt this is the best film I've ever seen, as far as my concern there is no minor things that will stop me from rating it 10.",10
"What a great movie. What journey and what struggle. The film maintains the viewers' interest thought in the middle just for a moment you might get the impression the film is a little too long. It is a classic. The acting is superb. The plot is strong enough to keep you glued to the screen, and the twists and turns make you feel you are watching a real situation from life, with artistic beauty about it. You never know how the movie will end, and then there can a twist yet in the tale that may turn out to be the very essence of the movie. The film is rightly an academic content by now. Apparently, you may feel the film is a little boring due to a prominent and beautiful woman missing, but the fact is the film does not fail in keeping you interested in it until the very end.",10
"Oh dear, one of the finest movies that I have ever seen!

The story of hope, belief, friendship and never giving up!!",10
The best movie of all time. I watched it more than 10 times. Best ever no doubt!!,10
"Let me start straight off by saying, I have watched this movie multiple times (10+) throughout my life and have enjoyed it every time.

It's been reviewed countless times and has stood the test of time - or a couple decades at least.

The characters are memorable and not easily forgotten, the story intrigues you all the way through (did he do it? Did he not?) and definetly made me at least feel four different emotions.

As the title of my review suggests, I don't know if it deserves to be at the top of the IMDB best of!

Would recommend..",10
"Part of that probably comes from the concept of tolerance, hope to bring freedom. It was answered clearly for Andy who does not make mistakes But patience to stay inside jail Doing what he loves, offering hope, goodness and kindness to others. (Proposed channels of tax evasion for the atrocities against their jailers, like beer, colleagues, by himself, does not touch alcohol, etc.) say it is my view that the Andy is in jail without fault. But he did not complain much. Not revenge Not rampant, but Andy use his intelligence and fortitude to fight. Finally, the truth and the good that makes this movie is all about",8
"I could write a long review, but I think 5his movie is perfect and I can't find anything to criticize and it gets the rating it deserves for best movie of all time. If there's one thing I can say is the performances the style everything was perfect.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption actually an outstanding film that come up with a story of dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoner. In the movie show many social problems, which are all discussed in the movie. Also it has a emotionally attached at the end of the film it almost make me cry out. This movie can capture and identify with American male spirit as it shows in movie. The movie actually talking about the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming and appealing. For this movie is consisting of a beautiful personal film fantastic acting well crafted story, great scenes, great characters and awesome plot, which make this movie turn out this good. It's the most touching and heart warming film of human spirit that I have seen and it might be a great movie to watch with family and be one of the best movies of all time. This film truly is a masterpiece. If you miss this film you will be missing out one of the finest film.",10

Performances of each actors was superb.. at the end..director stand top.. kudos to each technician in the movie..apart from other sections ...backgraound score was brilliant..to beat this movie record was takes more time in the history,10
Movie goes slow but this was one the best movies and one should watch this one.,10
"Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is a must see. The Acting by the two protagonists are spectacular. The use of Music in this movie is genius. And the camera work gives hope to any aspiring film maker. It also gives hope to the entire cinema world. 1994 what a year for movies! I end with a quote ""he dispersed like a fart in the wind.""",9

"You want a Connection with Movie ? You want a story that should continue in the movie ? You want to connect your Emotions with the movie ? ""Hope""is the Answer For The Shawshank Redemption Simple approach yet dramatic appeal . The Answer - HOPE is the displayed with classical touch of relation to the character and human spirit. Life Can break your Knees but your mind can stand up bright if you have hope is the best message passed on by The Shawshank Redemption through the movie. Mr Director has a simple way of conveying the idea of plot by properly justifying the characters and their role with qualities they en role.",6
"This is an incredible movie. No wonder it has so a high rating and even now after so many years also gives the same excitement. Sometimes when we watch a film it will be a great movie but hard to think of as something which can relate to a real story. This is so nicely crafted and it feels like every time you watch it gives a different perspective. Once it may make you think of a great masterpiece, next time you will be wondered what a screenplay and later you may think dialogues are wonderful.

Full package movie gives a vibe of awesomeness whenever we watch it.

We can watch it any number of times and it will not disappoint us.",10

"This was the only movie I ever re whatched,, I've never loved a movie like this one,, But for sure last week I think it's was the 9th Time i saw this movie it's really good and never boring.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is most obviously one of the greatest movies in film history. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make an unforgettable duo that captures the audience in magnificent acting and a well-written plot. There was not one moment where the movie did not hold my attention or seem boring. Therefore, it indubitably earns a 10/10 and praise. A tale of two jail inmates/friends, The Shawshank Redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. It proves that through all the troubling experiences, one man never loses sight of his dream. This not only gives Tim Robbins's character a chance of redemption but also chance for Morgan Freeman's character to be inspired by an endless struggle that pays in the end. Everyone of all ages should at one point in their lives watch this movie to witness not only great entertainment but also an inspiring story.",10
Need i say more the title of this review says it all...,10
"I've grown up with my parents talking about how great this movie is and finally I've got round to seeing it. It really is as brilliant as they say. It's moving, powerful, emotional, and brilliantly acted. I particularly loved Morgan Freeman's character. It had the same sort of tone as Forest Gump, and now I am a certified fan. Despite its age,it's still as amazing and excellent today as it was after its release. Very impressed and I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. The plot twists are also very enjoyable. When we see that a hole has been made through the prison wall, and we see the main character crawling through a sewage pipe to escape! Remarkable, moving, powerful stuff. I might just go and re-watch it now.",10

"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.

A passing reference to 'The Count of Monte Cristo' offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling.

Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed.

I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.

http://www.quantumvisionsystempdf.com",10
"One of the best movie all time. This is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.

The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",10
"Hmmmm!What a movie. My two pennies' worth is that you get your best friend to watch this movie with you, because this movie explains the definition of what true friendship entails The Shawshank Redemption epitomize everything you want in a movie. The suspense,thrills,frills,intrigue,pain,and hope exhibited in the movie was phenomenal. What more can I say about Morgan Freeman,his performance in the Shawshank Redemption was great and he exhibited mastery in delivering his lines. Tim Robbins,he truly justified his selection to be the lead actor in the movie. Please watch this movie and thank me later.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at the top of their games. This film is also probably what made Freeman (and particularly his voice) famous because of his distinctive narration style.

One thing I thought was interesting is that although the story focuses mostly on Andy (Robbins' character), I would suggest that is it Red (Freeman's character) that goes through the most changes. Andy arrives at the prison and ultimately changes Red's perception of the world with his carefree attitude, inner determination and hope.

Bob Gunton's prison warden starts as an almost likeable character, but as the film progresses we realise how corrupt and greedy he truly is. He becomes a truly vile antagonist. Mark Rolston's secondary antagonist Bogs Diamond is a slimy, disgusting man - a completely different persona from the gung ho Private Drake from Aliens. He really deserves to be a bigger star. I did not even realise it was the same actor for many years.

Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting tale about overcoming tremendous odds by clinging onto hope.",10
"This movie is amazing, it's a fantastic piece of film, which truly immerses you into its world. The acting is perfect, not a single character is played poorly, and I didn't once feel the movie was pulling my leg. It truly is the masterpiece people say it is. And while not my favourite movie personally, I can definitely understand why a lot of people do think so.

The movie is not for everyone, since it is a slow movie, it takes a while to get going, but it captivates you more than any other movie of its kind ever will. The movie is so grounded in reality, and never once makes you think ""What, how?"", it never makes you feel doubtful. You can tell the influence this movie has had on prison movies after this one was released, and you can definitely tell WHY.

Watch this movie, it's amazing. 10/10 no doubt. Just don't expect an action movie. This is not anything like that.",10
I indeed think that this picture is forever going to hold the audience's attention. Never gets old and never disappoints.,10
"One of the all time greats, never get tired of watching",10
"I'm the 2436th person to review this movie. I first saw this movie on TV while at a girl's house I was dating. I came in at about 30 minutes into the movie but I was truly captivated by the movie and I never forgot it. More than 15 years later I saw it on DVD uncut and I liked it even more. Some things I'd forgotten about from the last time I had seen it. But one thing I will never forget is the brutality of that lead guard, played by Clancy Brown. This was a movie that wanted me to abolish maximum security prisons! The violence, the rape the intimidation the corruption! It didn't start with Attica (See My Review Of Against The Wall) but has been in existence since America's founding.

Tim Robbin's character had the worst luck of anyone in the world! He was at the crime scene but did not go into the room where his wife was cheating on him. He left bullets behind and then stupidly threw his gone into the river only to not have it be discovered. Had he kept his gun the ballistics would have proved that his gun was not the murder weapon. As it stands another killer did the murder and in essence got away with the crime. This led to Andy's (Robbin's Character) being convicted for a crime he did not commit.

I was amazed at the inner strength that Robbin's character Andy had. He was beaten, humiliated, raped and yet was able to still persevere without losing his mind. But that's what he had in abundance. He had a mind and he used it to outwit his enemies and friends too. In many ways his escape reminded me of the two fellows who escaped from prison a few months ago in New York. It was a tenacious desire to get one's freedom from the oppression of the Man! This is why I admired Tim Robbins and his character, Andy.

Redd was portrayed so well by Morgan Freeman that the story might just as well have been about him too. I'm glad that Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford were not cast in these roles. The film would have suffered I'm sure. But I will say this, the film might have done better at the box office had the title been different. Shawshank Redemption is not really a catchy title and may have turned women and some men off entirely to seeing the film. This is what at least one writer said. Despite this I give the film Four and a Half Stars. Leonard Maltin gave it Two and a Half out of Four Stars. I disagree with that but he may have been turned off by the length of the film.

The author Robert A. Berman in his fantastic book Fade In: The Screen writing Process said something interesting. He said that he had read an article about films with bad titles. He said that almost every badly titled film did poorly at the box office. ""The Shawshank Redemption, which did okay in theatres, might have done more business with a better title. I passed on seeing The Shawshank Redemption in the theatres. The title just turned me off."" He went on to say that he saw it on Pay-For-View and liked it while adding that a good title can make a difference in box office sales. I concur with this observation. The title of this movie is nothing to write home about. This may have explained its average showing at the box office. Despite this, don't hold back from seeing this fine film. It's a true gem!",10
"Definitely one of the best films in film history. screenplay, acting, audios everything blended perfectly. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman performances were very good. A film I will watch many more times.",9
"Brilliantly crafted film from beginning to end that has only gotten better with age. The cast gives career best performances, with Morgan Freeman cementing his place as Hollywood's favorite narrator in Red while Robbins is charming & mysterious as Andy Dufrane. They are surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, particularly Robert Gunton as the menacing warden & James Whitmore as the tragically fated Brooks. Behind the camera, Frank Darabont brilliantly adapts Stephen King's story and quite frankly improves it by condensing the story & characters (this, like ""Jaws"", ""The Godfather"", & ""The Princess Bride"" rank as films that are actually better than their books). His direction is nicely non-flashy & gives the actors plenty of time to breathe. He also doesn't cheat in building towards the brilliant ending (one of the best in film history) laying clues but not spelling them out, making repeat viewing all the more fun (notice how Andy is only presented from other's perspectives & not his own). Simply put, one of the best film's produced in the last 30 years and a classic by any definition.",10
"One of the greatest movies ever made. Shawshank tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker convicted of his wives (and her lovers) murder. When Andy comes across inmate Red, the two form a near two decade long relationship. With Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman in lead roles, Shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. Frank Darabont's directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. There's really not much wrong with Shawshank. The adaptation from Stephen Kings epic novel is compelling, exciting, disheartening and inspiring. With great supporting characters, an incredible plot and stunning directing, Shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. Its an absolute travesty that this didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition.",10
I don't know what to say. A film I just can describe as an absolut masterpiece !!,10
"Shawshank Redemption made me feel the above TAGLINE when i first saw the film. It moved me even more when i saw it for the second time under different circumstances. Till now it still amazes me how this film can keep motivating me and my friends whenever we see the film again.

That Explains it all. Short & true.",9
"The movie ,though good,is relatively slow and simple than a movie should be of such a high rating.The major criteria of its high rating is its simplicity and the presentation of prison life in the movie which is actually quite convincing.Also the movie is quite emotional that makes you feel cry at some moments.The plot of the movie is simple and short enough.The director focuses much more on filming prison life than completing the plot which is quite good from critics point of view.We find this attitude among directors in very few movies nowadays.Freeman, as usual,out shows his impressive acting skills which adds a great flavor to its originality.But if you like action,drama,thriller movie this might not be able to cater your demands.Instead if you like to have a good time watching some fine stuff in terms of originality its a must watch.",10
"I watched this movie again and again. No movie is better than shawshank. morgan freeman narrate is 100% deserved an oscar .Unbelieveable dialog , great story and perfect ending .Simply the best movie in the universe . I can't believe my eyes for this superb film.",10
There's a reason if this is the top rated movie in many listings. It's a masterpiece with a powerful message which is told with elegance and dignity.,10
"My Review will be in 5 Main Parts: 1- The Goal (10 out of 10): The Movie Goal is ""freedom"" and it's only right image (main character point of view), The movie portrayed some image of freedom for some people ""The person who used to slavery did not afford freedom, the one that was as same as the first one when he found a goal for his life he found the true freedom and the main character of course who did not forget the meaning of being free. 2- The Excitement: (10 out of 10) It found here in suffering of the main character which was touch the heart. 3- The influence: (10 out of 10) The movie have portrayed alot of joy, suffering, sad, happy, ... etc situations which was truely good enough. 4- The Vital (10 out of 10): Was there absolutely in every part of the movie. 5- Overview (7 out of 10) As general it was very good movie *BUT* There was no need of the scene of his wife with the traitor, but what can i say: it is the dirty cinema ""Ecstasy for money"". My Rating: 47/50 == 9/10",10
"One of the best movies ever! The writing, the acting, the story all great! Well done! :)",5
"Recently played mafia 2, a way out etc prison type game...actually inspired.

This movie is the go-to one for me whenever I feel down or whenever I need some sort of motivation. This is something more than just a movie and seeing that it was made in 1994 was really unbelievable. The BGMs in the movie keep it alive every minute and even every second of the movie. It is like, it potrays something that had happened for real, damn! The movie will remain in your mind forever even if you had watched it only once. I'm not a big fan of reviews but this movie made me to write such a lengthy review. Speaking about the characters in the movie, damn they had nailed it! A big high-five for the director who got the best out of 'em! The camera-man, yo' man, your work was perfect like a pearl! The music artists, you made a lot of people's day! This movie will melt even the hardest hearts, it will always keep you engaged, for each and every second! I wonder, how such movies keep us hooked and kindle our hearts like anything! A big heart to everyone on the set! Long live, people!",10
"best movie i watched ever. I had most trouble believing were not the way the criminal always barely escapes, not the story or the era or the feel of the movie, but that Cusack's character had any feelings at all. He seemed apathetic and occasionally angry. That was it. And that made the film, a good film overall, not be better than average.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is in my opinion one of the best films ever. It is a great film because of its amazing performances given by the actors. Some amazing writing, directing and overall atmosphere. This film is very good as it captures prison life very well and its story is magnificent having the Characters changing around and doing certain things that push this film along. This film feels like it should be a TV-show as there is so much that happens in this film it could easily be a 6 episode series. The characters that are introduced through the film only add more elements for the characters to play off of making it very easy for the actors. I don't need to say much more, this film is a masterpiece, you must watch this film at some point in your life.",10
"When I went to watch this movie, I was feeling particularly down so I did what any normal person does and googled 'feel good Netflix movies'. Of course I had heard of Shawshank redemption- who hasn't- but I was surprised to find it on a list of feel good movies as I had always had it down as a sad, depressing movie about loss. I'm pretty sure I presumed this because of where it was set- in a prison- one of the most hopeless places a man/woman could be if you ask me. However, while watching the movie I realised I was wrong. This movie is about hope, acceptance, love and friendship a,lung many other important themes. The story line is just stunningly moving and the cast... Just amazing. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a feel good movie that isn't just another chick flick, that needs a movie that will hit home.",8
"The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.

I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.

The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",10
I love thisfilm and it is cool. I like this. I like this,9
"One of the all time great films. Morgan Freeman's acting is superb, Stephen King's work added to the excellent screenwriting and directing has offered a film that would rank top 25 on any list.",10

"Watched this movie over and over whenever I'm in a feeling to see a ""compact"" movie.",10
Among the top ten best movies I've ever seen. It's a beautiful story. Morgan Freeman played a lot. It's a masterpiece.,10
"We rarely see such great movies, they are among my best. The sequence of events is wonderful, the choice of actors is wonderful, the duration of the movie is also very excellent, an integrated movie.",10
"You know, there are some movies which will disturb you. Terrify, even. But in a GOOD way. And this is one such movie. Whoever came up with this story irrespective of it being true or not, is undoubtedly a pure genius. After watching shallow movies of this generation where every filmmaker's goal is to commercialize cinema as much as possible, these type of movies SUCK the air out of your lungs. The plot in itself is so gut-wrenching combined with the impeccable acting by Tim and Morgan, makes for a very very disturbing movie in a loving way. Sadly and fortunately you will NOT be forgetting this movie anytime soon. The Shawshank Redemption, Silence of the Lambs, Pursuit of Happyness and a million other older movies are so worth your time. Whoever has said Old is Gold was a true genius in saying so. I will not reveal the movie's plot one bit but the cinematography and the elocution in the sequencing of the scenes are so perfect, you'll actually cry that the movie ended. You'll admire, love, laugh, cry, feel the pain of Andy as if you are Andy itself. Wonderful execution by the cast and crew. Kudos to the effort. Brilliant Performances. And a true worth of your 2 hours 22 minutes.",10
One of the best movie i watched ever.before i watch this movie every time i see this movie imdb 1st rating movie but now i have idea why this movie is top.,9
Some movies you can just watch over and over. This is one of those.,10
What can I say about a great movie ummm GREAT MOVIE !,10
"Simply the best movie I've ever seen in my life. The performances are excellent and clean, engaging story. It's one of those movies that leaves you thinking about life for months. Awesome! It deserves the first place.",9
Everything about this movie is flawless. No better way to describe it in my opinion.,10
"If I get to choose one movie that will remain in this universe forever, it will be The Shawshank Redemption. It has all the right ingredients that makes it enduring and timeless. The screenplay is flawless and the casting, perfect. I thank Stephen King for writing the book and Frank Darabont for making the movie.",10
And we waiting more movies like The Shawshank Redemption,9
"The movie is full of hope and it got me a lot of positive energy. The cast and music are great. I liked the screenplay and it has a really surprising ending. I regret that this movie had to compete with other powerful movies like ""Forrest Gump"" in the Academy Awards and lost many nominations to it.",10
"Andy is introduced to the library by Brooks in 1949. Brooks points out a Louis L'Amour section, but L'Amour's first book under his own name wasn't published until 1953 (he had written a series of Hopalong Cassidy novels in the late 1940s under the name Tex Burns), and didn't produce enough books to warrant his own section until the 1960's.",10
"This is the film that made me realize how far a short story can go. The first time I saw this film I was quite young, didn't fully understand the content but I knew I was watching a master piece and knew that I needed to focus on my writing. Whittmore knocks his performance out of the park. I miss him and Frank is now one of my hero's.",10
"It is with great reverence and admiration that I express my profound appreciation for The Shawshank Redemption, a film that unequivocally stands as the pinnacle of cinematic excellence. This extraordinary work of art, is not only a testament to the power of storytelling but also a shining example of the human spirit's resilience in the face of adversity.

The masterful direction of Frank Darabont, coupled with the compelling narrative adapted from Stephen King's novella, has created an unparalleled cinematic experience. Every element of the film, from the acting to the cinematography, coalesces into a symphony of raw emotion, making The Shawshank Redemption an unforgettable journey.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's iconic portrayals of Andy Dufresne and Ellis ""Red"" Redding, respectively, have left an indelible mark on the annals of film history. Their characters' friendship, forged within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, transcends the screen, resonating with audiences on a deeply emotional level.

The film's cinematography, guided by the genius of Roger Deakins, captures the stark contrasts of despair and hope, painting a visual masterpiece that lingers in the minds of viewers long after the credits have rolled. Thomas Newman's evocative score enhances the emotional depth of each scene, underscoring the film's themes of redemption and the indomitable human spirit.

The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic, a beacon of hope and inspiration that continues to captivate audiences around the world. It is more than just a film; it is a testament to the enduring power of friendship, the triumph of good over evil, and the unwavering belief in the possibility of redemption. In the pantheon of cinematic masterpieces, The Shawshank Redemption will forever hold its place as the best film ever created.",10
Just amazing.No words needed. It makes you feel sad but in the same time ask questions to yourself anyway you can not stop watching it.,6
The which was #1 in the still feel proud about that. It tell that an accountant which doe't commit an crime of murder. And he been sent jail for that and there the story begins he mean time go work with others prisoner's and help cops for hide payment of tax to the government and he planned to escape form prison when the day he came and he escapes.,10
"I never given 10 on 10 for any movie in my life, The fact behind rating this movie as 10 on 10 is

First i watch this movie because of IMDb reviews, thought its overrated but proved me wrong.

Second this is my first and last review in IMDb only for this movie, if i again come to IMDb then its best movie beating this movie, its not about competition its about heart touching movie.

Then next is, i watch this movie half and thought to watch second half next day.

The interesting fact about next day is, i lost my 4k bucks but even though my heart took me to complete this movie.

After watching the movie i forgot all the pains and losses in my life.

What a beautiful movie. Really touched my heart from start to end, But in end, happy tears, what a beautiful feeling, background music, simply amazing.

Its 2017, don't know when i will watch this kind of movie again...",10
"'The more I know, the more I come to know, how less I know'. After watching thousands of movies and having some hundreds with me currently. I found 'The Shawshank Redemption' now. I have been avoiding this for some time, thinking that it would be another usual prison drama stuff. But since, IMDb had top rating, nominated for 7 Oscars, and some good reviews.

OMG what a movie- Amazing, how you get entangled in a web of deceit, and proving yourself innocent among those master treacherous is nothing less than impossible. Here how Hope takes charge and this proves when Morgan Freeman says at last ""Some birds are not to be caged as their feathers are just too bright"". Tim Robbins in role of Andy Dufresne is excellent in 'silent intellect on work' profile. Morgan freeman is not a surprise in ""Red"" as I have always liked his acting and not to forget his convincing voice.

On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.

The only other movie which I liked that far is ""Forest Gump"" and incidentally this was also released in 1994. If this doesn't say enough, set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my tie with Forest Gump.",10
This is the worstest movie i have see tyfussyhdtjigfd,10
Storyline and actors are soo good! All i can say is the whole movie was unexpected!,9
Everything about this film is just amazing. I could watch it everyday of my life.,10
This is the best movie of all time hands down. Everything about this movie is Amazing! What are you doing with your life if you haven't seen this movide,10
A good old tale. Two hour twenty two minutes of unsurpassable storytelling. A poetic dish served by the masterclass.,9
"An eternal movie..

The outstanding acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in additions to the well written scenario create something more than a film.. Something unique!

While you attend the movie you enter slowly in the world of Shawshank Prison. 'Hope' in this movie means not just a feeling but an escape from misery . The desire to be free connected his intelligence and his great knowledge of economics make Andy do things extraordinary that others were afraid or couldn't do . Andy Dufresne was already a living myth in the prison but that was not what he wanted, he was determined to make his dreams come true!

At the end of the movie with the unexpected escape of Andy, you can't do anything less but to bow in front of this unique conception...",9
"Performances, Direction, Lighting, Writing, Location management, Production....... All completely on point, I love this movie.",9
"The shawshank redemption is a great movie. The story of the movie and the messages about love, friendship, hope and the best of them freedom and how freedom can change the person and how the prison had a lot of incident people and all of this with the great performance of tim Robbins and the remarkable voice of Morgan freeman all of this is so great but this don't mean that the movie has issues at least in my opinion there was one character at the movie we had to know more about him i don't want to say who he was because this review is no spoilers and the second issue of the movie is it didn't make any sense that warden Norton character trust a prisoner that much and didn't even have suspension to him again i don't want to say who was the prisoner because this review is no spoilers so the movie is great but it's not that very huge masterpiece! It's not the best movie of all time! It's not the non issues movie!",10
"This is a film that can please anyone of any taste. Put in simple terms, this is a movie I highly recommend. It has a cast that works so naturally well together and not for one moment does the acting feel artificial or forced. I can not speak highly enough for this film.",10
"When i first watched this movie,which was about 10 years ago,i didnt understand much as i was very young,rewatching this it really hits the spot.Throught the whole movie it has really great performance and great actors,a very great movie overall.",9
"The best films are those which you just watch not knowing anything about it...not hearing any publicity...no mad movie premier parties just a tape in the video player, watching it with my granddad. I had just left school and film was a passion of mine. I loved watching and making them. I always loved the way films immersed you in and didn't let you go until the credits. This is the absolute prime example of that. Great story, acting, characters and a twisting slam-dunk of an ending. All my favourite films have that quality, seven, six sense and the game. Its just a shame that over the past few years there hasn't been any films which i can honestly add to that list. So come on Hollywood give us proper gutrenching twists not big grizzly apes!!!!",10
"Prison, murder and mystery- as a teenage girl at first glance this film didn't sound like my cup of tea, however Frank Barabont created a film that both me and my family love! The acting is incredible, the qoutes are powerfull and the storyline is so cleverly written that the ending (and I can't put this any better) had me shock. It is probably the best film i have ever and will ever see.",10
Excellence - truly one of the most amazing pieces of cinema i have ever seen. I wish i could put into words the impact the film had on me and what it lead me to thinking about.,10
"Its old movie but i recently watch this movie , i love the movie . actors and their acting were great . plot of the movig was amazing.",10
"Captivating, Uplififting and Important are three adjectives most appropriate for this picture. Captivating as this film did literally hold me captive under Morgan Freeman's spellbinding narration in addition to his sublime acting from Freeman, Tim Robbins and the supporting cast. Uplifting as this film truly made hope spring eternal and has done for film-lovers across the globe. Finally this picture is important as there are many people in this world who have given up hope, are denigrated and dejected and may even feel that there life has no purpose but this film has renewed life to many people. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne(Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and sent to Shawshank Prison for life and forms an unlikely friendship and bond with Red(Freeman) and his gang, who initially reject him, that's all I'll prefer to tell you of the film to maximise it's impact.",7
"One of the things you prefer not to talk about , fearing that the words would mess its greatness .",10
The most confounding film ever made. Much of it is generic prison fare which we've all seen dozens of times before but is able to rise above most other films due to some genuinely inspired scenes powerful enough to melt the hardest of hearts.,10
"This is one of the most under-rated (by the so-called experts) films of all time.

There are no weak links in the cast. Direction and filming are of classical quality; and the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are virtually flawless. The fact that neither of them received either Best Actor, or Best Supporting actor is, to me, totally incomprehensible. Having said that, I personally would have trouble in assigning which award to which actor. When I see the dross that receive Oscars, I find it totally unreal that Morgan Freeman has, to date (December 2005), received only one supporting actor award - shame on the Academy.

The storyline/plot is fairly standard and competent. All along you get the feeling that Andy (Tim Robbins), and Red (Morgan Freeman) will get something out of the whole affair, but the final twist in the entrapment of the prison governor is quite original.

The Shawshank redemption was worthy of a minimum of three Oscars, and the fact that it received none is one of the greatest ever shames attributable to The Acadamy and its members.",10
"One of the best or I should say, Best of best movie.",10
This movie is an excellent viewing. It reminded me of playing chess.,6
My favorite movie alll time great actor and history !,8
"This movie is just the one of the best movies I've ever watched. It is really really good. Everything's good in it. Some sceneces made me very sad because it made me live the movie like it was my life, like it was me.",10
BEST FILM EVER i have seen 1007 films and 705 tv-series this film is best and after that is not godfather but Fightclub and American History X,10
"I can confidently say, it's the best movie that I have ever seen. The plot is great , you like to follow the olot. Actors are perfect. It has a very nice story with a great ending. Highly recommend it.",10
"Yes, the leads are good actors, but that doesn't make the movie much better. I read an Esquire poll once that listed this as one of the male voters' top 10 movies of all time, and after the listing, Esquire wrote (huh?) couldn't agree more.",10
I did not knew this movie so far.... i saw him yesterday and i am suprised about the quality of this movie. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in one of theire best.,10
"After watching this masterpiece, i shouted... How I missed that!!!",9
When i saw this... my mind was full of hope i realy love this movie the actors are so good,9
It was a beautiful film. I can even say the best movie I've ever seen in my life,9

It is movie that inspires me always.The best movie i have ever seen.,10
The film more than twenty years ago still looks impressive.,10
"This film has some of the best movie line that will inspire me through all the time. whenever i fell bore or something this film make me keep going.when i see that man who had a dream , dream that all he had.that dream, that freedom of life, that his wisdom of thought.in all those movie i watched in my life there is some of them that inspire me,that give me strength this movie is one of them. one of the best line that is to say hope is the best thing , probably the best of thing and no good thing ever dies.",10
Ast and crew have done a full and fantastic job. The continuity and confidence in the story is remarkable. The idea behind the nature of the human behaviour and comprehension of its depth is clearly visible throughout the scenes.,10
"The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",10
"Simply the best film I've ever seen. Inspiring, uplifting, well acted, and beautifully filmed. It is a crime that Forrest Gump was even considered for best picture the same year this film was out.",10
This movie I can see again and again and again...,9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" deserves the title of the Most Moving Movie of All Time.

Picking a list of ""The Best Movies Ever"" is always a ridiculous and futile practice. A look at IMDBs top 10 shows several entirely different movies, from ""Star Wars"" to ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Godfather."" The only characteristic shared by all 10 is that they are ""worth watching."" So, since Shawshank held the #1 slot for many months, it received plenty of ranting, illogical, completely undue criticism:

* That its characters were static - Simply not true. They do become moral icons by the end of the movie, but they evolve into their parts.

* That there is too much preaching/narration/""babying"" - There is nothing out of place in this movie. Red doesn't labor his narration because he's pedantic, he does it because he's straightforward - this isn't a college professor speaking - and absolutely, astoundingly beautiful. Yes, there is the panoramic shot of the azure pacific at the end - but it dovetails neatly with the story - ""Something that big would scare me."" (Not verbatim).

* That there are perhaps 15 minutes at the end of the movie in which the fate of the characters is clear and 5 after questions have been resolved - This is absolutely necessary. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" attempts to leave the viewer thinking about ideas, not plot twists. Though this is only ever argued on scholastic (rather than aesthetic) grounds, even Star Wars' ending would have seemed abrupt without a brief, ceremonial resolution.

* That its foreshadowing or narration cuts drama - missing the point. I shutter to think of this film if told entirely from the present - it would loose its beauty. There's deliberately a lot of ""time passing"" sequences. The real reason this movie has its high ranking is that it grapples with ""hope"" - and hope, like all abstract notions, becomes concrete with introspection, and introspection takes time. This is not a ""prison escape"" movie.

See this movie. Think about this movie. Talk about this movie. The Shawshank Redemption thinks and feels more than other works of popular cinema, and demands that viewers do the same. I almost envy anyone who hasn't seen it yet; the first viewing is absolutely magical.",10
"An all-time favorite. I am a college professor, and have used this film in sociology, science of success, and various legal classes that I teach. The reactions of students are almost always extremely poignant. An inspirational prison movie. Unbelieveable.",10
One of the best movies ever. It's a masterpiece.I could watch it a billion times if I had time.,10
"This is an excellent movie. I usually get depressed watching prison movies. Even though the pace of the movie was slow, it is so well made that it keeps your interest alive all the time. The narrative style also added to the relaxed pace. I am sure anybody who watched the movie would come out feeling good about life. The message is pretty clear - even though the obstacles in life seem to be daunting and often impossible to overcome, with hope, will-power and dedication, everything is achievable. Tim Robinson and Morgan Freeman were simply great and played their roles to perfection. I also liked the concept of institutionalization - after a while some people would rather want to be in prison than be faced with a whole new world which has changed so much from what they were used to.",6
"I first saw The Shawhank Redemption a year back and I was totally blown away. this film is perfect in EVERY sense, from acting to story to score,to costume to cinematography. in fact i think they should have made a new academy award, best feeling film or something.

This film was clearly ripped off at the 1994 oscars. forrest gump IS a good flick i agree, but if u look at character development,story and acting shawshank comes out on top.

If for some reason u aint seen this film watch it now... it truly IS the greatest.

and remember hope is a good thing maybe the best of things.....and no good thing ever dies....and nor will shawshank.

6.58x10^96 is what i give it out of 10",10
"Perhaps the greatest challenge of the AMPAS is determining what defines a ""Best Picture."" I have heard it defined from some forgotten source directly tied to the AMPAS that a Best Picture is one that holds itself superb in the following three categories: Direction, Writing, and Acting, not necessarily in that order. A good example would be Citizen Kane, arguably the most worthy winner of these three categories (Kane lost to How Green and never picked up the Best Picture statue). However, it is certain that the greatest film of all time would need to excel especially in one field: Originality. How many people would even go bother to see another interpertation of Titanic? However, if this particular film had come out before the Cameron version, it would certainly be hailed with critical acclaim. Shawshank is one that meets the AMPAS standards of excellence, and most certainly would have taken the Best Picture title, if not for Forrest Gump, a film which many members perhaps found it impossible to not vote for due to the momentum it had gained. If Shawshank had been nominated almost any other year of this decade, the statue would have been a lock. However, we must look at Shawshank not as the year's Best Picture, but as a film in the long timeline of movie history, a film which tells an original story with original acting style and original directing. Can we look at Shawshank and with all sincerity call it the greatest film ever? Before deciding, a prerequisite should be to see at least 50 of the best films of this century. In this way, Shawshank loses the advantage of being fresh in our memory, losing the emotional effect, and must bow to the annals of time as do all the other superb films of history. Shawshank is not the Best Picture of all time nor the greatest film of all time. This is a fact we must face and learn to live with, no matter how much the storyline touched us all.",10
"A great film. Period. Those of you who haven't watched it yet, make sure to do so. Don't listen to those who say it isn't a great movie - obviously most of the rest of the world does think it was an absolute great movie. Watch it and judge for yourselves.",10
"Probably the best movie i ever seen, Freeman is one of the best actor in this world for me ,",10
"(Note: my English is not really superb!!!) This movie is absolutely one of the most underestimated movies ever. This great all-round performance has never gotten the recommendation it deserves. I was very happy to discover that I'm not the only one who's deeply touched by this movie. A deserved first place I think. And for everyone who hasn't seen it yet, and can appreciate real quality: you really have to see this one!!!",6
"This film was great - and that's a poor way to describe it. IT was fantastic!!! You see into the lives of Andy and Red and all the others in Shawshank. Not only do you gain insight as to how the prisoners live, but also how they work and live with one another, and how badly they are treated at times, by both fellow prisoners and by the guards. This movie also shows how that in some cases instead of preparing a prisoner for life back on the streets, prison will make them prepared for life only on the inside. The example of this is the elderly librarian prisoner. He has been in prison for many many years, and finally he is let out. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes a good prison movie or just one that seems to be real life.",9
"This movie has gradually become my favorite. After the first viewing, I was in complete awe at the way the events lead up to the final events with Andy. The second time, I realized that the prevalent theme is hope. The third, then the fourth, then the fifth... etc.... forever, I realized that this movie has so many elements, that a review such as this doesn't provide ample space to discuss them all.

I think that what makes this movie so unique, is its portrayal of prison life. Most of the time, prisons are either romanticized in that they don't portray all of the harsh elements of it. The other times, the writers try too hard to prove how harsh a prison is. They portray them as places where the convicts should give up hope because its Hell on Earth until you die, and everybody begs to come out as soon as the parole board gives their say-so. This movie, however, completely illustrates the harsh realities of prison, as well as a place where one learns to hate it, but then gets used to it (as Red said). Andy made a best friend there. Had he not gone to prison, he never would've met Red. Besides, the prisoners (for the most part) seemed to be having a fairly good time most of the time and probably couldn't imagine being anywhere else.

Stephen King also brings out an element of crime and punishment. I find it very ironic that Andy, a fairly good man is the only one that doesn't give up hope of living on the outside. I think that one of the most important parts of the movie is when Andy talks about how whatever sins he has committed, has been paid for. Andy is one of the only ones that doesn't give up hope because he doesn't belong there.

One more thing is the way that Andy brings a form of salvation to others. He makes prison more human. He gets the guys the beers so that they'll never forget the freedom of the outside world. In addition, he asks for the name of the ""fresh fish"" in the beginning. As proven by a later movie, Saving Private Ryan, asking what a person's name is seems to prove as a very effective way of humanizing what is actually inhumane.

There are a gajillion other themes, but I would exhaust myself trying to explain them all. So if the thousand of other good reviews on this page don't influence you to watch it, hopefully this will. The acting is incredible (as a guy, its hard to imagine that a two hour plus movie without an actress is bearable). I don't think that you can compare this movie with any others because there aren't too many movies that inundate the watcher from the beginning with loads and loads of themes and concepts. Furthermore, its impressive the way almost every element has some significance. In the beginning, even the most trivial of details that evade the eye the first time become essential elements in Andy's final scene (in hope not to spoil the ending).

But I must warn you. The first time: this movie is good, the second time: its better, the third time: its addicting. Don't say that I didn't warn you. Ten plus out of ten!!! Thank you IMDB for finally putting this very underrated movie in its rightful place.",9
"I truly believe this is one of the best films I have ever seen.

Slow to start, but then it grabs you totally (I Recommend going to the loo before you start watching, as you will not be able to force yourself to turn the Vid off when you get hooked).

The film is full of feeling and emotion, it gave/still gives me goose bumps, in places.

Sad as it may seem, I have bought the video twice, cause I am worried that the 1st one will be worn out too quickly (& I'm not joking).

What can I tell you about the film, nothing much as it would ruin the many brilliant different, yet connected stories within. Except to say it is about a man who ( In true tradition) ends up in a prison (Shawshank) yet professes his innocence, and eventually be-friends a fellow black inmate.

The story is narrated by the afore mentioned inmate portrayed by Morgan Freeman, who's doleful voice, and heart thought comments are so beautiful, and so suited to the film.

Tim Robbins ( the new inmate ) plays his role wonderfully, and interacts with the film ( a credit to his skill ) wonderfully.

If I have not convinced you to watch the film ( Which I personally have Recommended to numerous people, who all loved it) there is the music and the fantastic images of the prison itself. Overwhelming in every respect.

I still have a tear in my eye at the end of the film, even now.

Let Me Know.

I really hope you enjoy, this, so under acknowledged film.

Let Me Know.",9
The best movie ever. Morgan Freeman should have won the Oscar and Tim Robbins should have been nominated. The greatest sin the Academy of Motion Pictures ever did was not give this movie at least one oscar win. 0 of 7 is pathetic! the film should have won every award it was nominated for,8
"This is one of the best movies around. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are great in this movie. I'm fifteen, and the only part of this movie I didn't appreciate is the part about the homosexual rapist gang. That part I can do without, but the rest of the movie is flawless. Rent it, buy it, steal it, borrow it, do whatever it takes to see this movie.",10
My second loved movie about life friends and how to be stronger,10
"story was excellent. i like it when i can relate to a man who is in prison--even though i haven't been to one. my guess is the author's connected me through human emotions and the basic human condition to his characters. acting left nothing to be desired.

i particularly appreciated symbology of the film: cigarettes were money, perverted sex was the norm, corruption from the top down, where's my life going? it doesn't sound like a prison film necessarily.",10
"Why I loved (and still love) this film? There are three main reasons? First the writing is exceptionnal, I haven't noticed a flaw in the scenario (every scene seems logical when you see the film again). Then the actors gives the best of themselves (Morgan Freeman delivers maybe his most poignant performance), but what is remarkable in this movie, is the quality of supporting actors (without them the film wouldn't have worked so perfectly) And finally like I underline above the film shows its full potential only when you've seen it (a least) twice, then you realise the complexity of the story, in fact they could have made two films from this one: One about Red (the old con), one about Andy (""the fresh fish"") and his struggle to endure life in prison.",10
"The Price of Bondage is one of the most beautiful films ever made about hope. Even the hope and dignity of Andy Dufresne is enough. If it is the phrase to live fast or die fast; I can say that it really sums up the worldly life. Finally, I leave by leaving one of the most beautiful words in this magnificent masterpiece movie..",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite films of all time because it triumphs in capturing human feelings through it's acting, music, scenery and many moods. Although the story takes place in a bitter prison, we all can relate to the feelings of dispair and the bonding of true friends and the hope that it brings. A masterpiece.",10
"Okay, the first 20 minutes you think this is a regular movie you have seen a hundred times. But then you are wrong. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie you`ll never forget. Morgan Freeman, not to mention Tim Robbins, both make this movie unforgettable!",10
"It's a great thing when you can finally find a movie you can definitively call ""your favorite"". This is mine. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", based on Stephen King's short novella entitled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", is an excellent adaptation of said literature...I will go out and say it; I've read the story and seen the movie, and although the movie took some parts out (in the story, there were three different wardens over the course of the story, and Red was Irish, not black), it expanded the detail greatly, covering parts the novella never bothered to touch on (such as Andy getting a new set of clothes and a shiny pair of shoes from the Warden ^_^). The characters are all detailed and alive, not once did I find a character unbelievable. And I've never EVER seen an ending so incredible. My eyes were wide, I was chanting ""Oh My God"" over and over...This movie makes you feel good all over and gives you a new perspective on life and freedom. This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece. The only fault I find is that it came out at the time as Forrest Gump, which had a lot more advertising and thus beat this great movie out in the box office. Had it come out a few months later, it would have been much more successful.",10
"This movie should be seen by all the movie lovers. It express a lot of feelings. Mad, angry, love, friendship and a lot more. I could give 10 stars because simply it is the best movie ever. No fancy CGI just the pure genius of acting and a very good story line. The cinematography also outstanding. This movie is fit to be watched by all level of age. There are a lot of things that can be learned in the movie. Even it is screened on 1994, the quality of the movie is so amazing making its hard for the director to produce a better one. I hope there will be a lot more film that has the quality or a better one compared to The Shawshank Redemption.",9
"Very rarely does a movie come along that inspires people to hold on to their faintest hopes. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is just such a movie. Have you ever felt like all hope was lost? Tim Robbins plays a wrongfully convicted man who very easily could have let his hopes die, but instead decides to patiently plot his escape to freedom. Excellent performances make this movie an incredible can't miss.",10
"it is great to see that this movie is in the top 5. this is where it belongs. one of the greatest movies of all time. what made it great was they showed how two had struggles of their own in prison. one wanted to get out, and does after 19 years, and the other makes parole as an old man and almost feels he serves no purpose in the outside world and feels that jail is where he belongs. this is one of my most favorite movies and its hard too see how some didn't like it 10/10",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It is certainly the finest work of Tim Robbins' career, and Morgan Freeman even surpasses his usual lofty standard of excellence. This is one of those few movies that one can watch many times over and never get tired of it. It is hard to believe that the story is based on a novel by Stephen King. Every aspect of this film is first rate. It's the closest to a perfect film I've seen in the decade of the nineties.",10
"This film is purely exceptional in every respect, and as such is in my opinion the greatest film ever made. The performances from lead characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are brilliant in every way, they are both moving and totally believable, tacing the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotions before leaving them in a ending that is unforgettable.

The story of Andy Dufresne's tenure at Shawshank Prison is an inspirational story, and whether you want a great drama, or just an entertaining night's viewing this film is a must see!",10
"Sure, everyone is entitled to his opinion, but in the case of The Shawshank Redemption, the statement ""This movie is not a 1 on a 1 to 10 scale"" is not an opinion, it's a fact. There are no sensible arguments that can be made for this being a 1.",10
A great film for those who enjoy prison-escape-type films and also for Stephen King fans. Brilliant performances from Tim Robbins (Jacobs Ladder) and Morgan Freeman (Se7en) emphasize the intricate and clever plot. A must for everyone who's even just slightly fond of watching movies !!,9
"""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free."" The Shawshank Redemption is the very touching story of a man who makes mistakes with his life and is imprisioned. While there, Andy (Tim Robbins) is faced with some very cruel people, including Byron Hadley(Clancy Brown) and a group of inmates called ""the sisters"". But he also meets a man named Ellis Redding (played by the oh so talented Morgan Freeman) and forms a heart warming friendship. Basically, Andy Dufresne goes through many life trials which will chill your blood, make your heart race, bring a tear to your eye, and a smile to your lip. Wonderful movie, my all time favorite. This is also based on the short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" written by my favorite author, Stephen King.

This movie also has MANY wonderful monologues and great quotes.

Please watch, and I am sure you will enjoy. ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."" ~~ML",10
I'm not going to elaborate on what has already been written by others - except to say that the popularity for this film is enormous. I don't think I know ANYONE who didn't like it - it will be recognised as one of THE films of the 90's.,10
"An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top ""prison"" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through.",10
"This is much more than a prison film. This is a film about how the human spirit can conquer the most unspeakable abyss and come out clean at the other side. In addition, the story at the heart of it, of Andy (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freedman)is simply a story of two men's friendship -- something seldom explored in cinema, and rarely as well. Lastly, the theme of hope echoes and throughout the film and reverberates in the viewer's minds like an aria against hard prison walls.",10
"Hope, love, belief, friendship, feeling. Watch this film and re-establish once again what is good about the movies. If you don't particularly like watching films, I urge you to watch this and experience something unlike you have experienced before. This, alongside AMERICAN BEAUTY, is one of the greatest films ever made.",10
"This was an awesome movie. I didn't expect it to be that good, when I first started to watch it. First time I saw it I fell asleep. It must have been because I was tired. Because now it was a wonderful movie. And if anybody from Mt. Vernon, Iowa reads this. It's great to watch it as we were supposed to do it in a class there last year but weren't allowed to because of the rating (R).",10
"I made my Stephen King debut with this particular story when I was in my late teens. Frank Darabont shot a wonderful adaptation which is not very common. Great actor Tim Robbins played the unfortunate Dufresne with such a grace that you never think that the guy was very small in size in the original story. Morgan Freeman is in his prime playing Red, the most useful person in the jail. The suicide of the old prisoner and the last scene where both friends meet are the most emotional ones. And of course we should salute the most beautiful supporting actress ever, Rita Hayworth. Darabont never tries to steal parts from the original story. May be this is why the film is always remembered as a good piece of art.",10
"It is almost impossible to glorify this movie more than it deserves because, simply I believe it is the greatest ever made. The story, characters, music are absolutely mesmerizing. The story of the never say die hope of a wrongfully convicted man sent to prison for life is awe-inspiring and poignant. Watch this with someone you love and cherish. **** stars",10
"This was one of the very first movies that got me choked up. I first saw it on a Pay television network, then decided that I had to have it. To think that such a worthy film in all categories (Acting, Directing, Etc.) did not receive not one Oscar. Yes! I was p***ed off as well. It was much better that Forrest Gump, but hey I don't decide what wins and what doesn't. This is a definite movie for everyone!",10
This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life the acting and story are superb. If you have not seen this movie go see it RIGHT NOW! This movie has wone 7 Oscars I think and it deserves ever one of them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are a great team together,10
"For those who have not seen The Shawshank Redemption, you have, so far, missed a genuine treat. I have seen hundreds of films. I don't think I have ever seen more than two or three that combined what I consider to be the five basic aspects requisite for consideration as a masterpiece. This is one of those films. The five basic elements are great acting--in which we the viewer see the character, feel the character, not the actor; a great score/sound-track; a cinematic quality that enables the viewer to experience the surroundings, not just view them; great dialogue and non-dialogue--the best scripts usually utilize not only the verbal abilities of actors, but non-verbal expression as well (see a film with Cary Grant or Robert De Niro to know what I mean); and most important a compelling story.

The Shawshank Redemption not only offers ALL of these, but does so at a level few films have ever reached.

The basic plot is simple enough: a man is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and the man with whom she is having an affair. Why then is it so great? The performances, all around, but especially of Robbins and Freeman are so rich, so human, the viewer feels they are living their experiences. The film demonstrates, magnificently, how a man can create a meaningful life against horrid (mentally and physically) circumstances. The film wrenches the guts of its viewers, yet provides great satisfaction in the end. It is a great film celebrating determination, friendship, revenge (as sweet as you will ever see), education, and the basic goodness intrinsic to all people.",10
"...that if you've never seen this movie, that you'll take the time to watch.

Even if it's from the beginning, the middle or the last 20 minutes. I watch this movie when it's on TV. Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors in America, and his portrayal of Red's journey of friendship and to freedom is touching. His words, ""get busy living or get busy dying,"" never fail to hit home. It's just a good story that Frank Darabont turned into an excellent movie. The performances are all good - Freeman deserved an Oscar. Absolutely one of the best movies ever.",10
"I saw Shawshank quite a few years ago now. However, upon visiting the IMDB Top 250 list and finding it two from the top, I was not surprised. Despite the fact that I saw the movie is 1996 or 1997, I can still remember some of the poignant momments in the film and how the entire film made me feel (heartfelt and happy!).

Overall, I think Shawshank was an absoloutely amazing film. It showcases great performances from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and also demonstrates the quality of writing that people should expect from somebody like Steven King.",10
this is the greatest movie i have ever seen. by reading the plot you may think of it as just another prison movie. it's more of a friends movie. the greatest portrayal of how wonderful a friend is i have ever seen. i love this movie and have seen it a million times and will see it another million times.,10
"Perhaps the only thing more remarkable than this masterpiece of a movie is the fact that neither Tim Robbins nor Morgan Freeman won Oscars for their performances. I would put Freeman's portrayal of Ellis Redding amongst the best performances ever in a movie...so moving, so powerful. And the fact that this film did not win Best Picture is all the more unsettling.

This movie isn't just about a couple of guys in prison. Anyone who sees that, well, that must be where the ""1"" ratings came from. The message of hope is so positively inspiring. This is a movie that immensely impacted my life, something I can't say about any other film. Forrest Gump? Sure it was a good movie, but it really was just about a slow-witted man on a bench discussing his life. It never should have won Best Picture. I'm not sure if the MPAA ever saw this movie, maybe that explains it. Not only was the acting magnificent, but the ending is one of the best in movie history. I'm a 19 year old male, and I can't remember the last time I cried for anything. But the final scene in The Shawshank Redemption reduced me to tears. If there is anyone reading this who has not seen this movie, you would be doing yourself a huge injustice if you didn't run to the video store immediately. I've seen all the ""Great"" movies -- Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Godfather (not to mention American Beauty, the most overrated movie ever), but none of them even comes so close as to compare to this movie. Plain and simple, the Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen, and it will be a very long time before something better comes along. 20/10 if I could.",10

"BEST MOVIE EVER !!!

The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.",10
"This simply is the best movie I've ever seen. With 2 of the greatest actors (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) and such a great ending, it will be difficult to beat (in my case). This movie will be the standard for 'jail-movies' for a very long time!",9
"In my book this is the best movie ever made, or at least my favorite. I know that may be going out on a limb, but it is that spectacular. It makes me smile every time in the end, it actually brings me near tears which very few movies have ever done.",10
"With all due respect to the people that complain of it's too stark good vs. evil characters, simplicity and so on... you are missing the point. Having been raised on a steady diet of Hollywood crap, this was first, and only, movie that has been truly inspirational and moved me to tears. This is NOT standard Hollywood material. It has been pointed out that, in general, optimism is equated with ignorance. I was of that opinion as well, but this was truly a LIFE-CHANGING movie for me. This wasn't a movie so much as it was a wake-up call. I've seen all the classics. But nothing I've encountered has conveyed such a message of positivity and hope as this movie, without being contrived or obvious. To all those who pour negative reviews on ""Shawshank"", stop being a critic, and start being human. To everyone else, I think we're all better people for having seen it.",10
"I have no clever thoughts or ideas about this movie. I am not going to discuss the plot, acting, or directing. It is just the best movie I have ever seen. Period. End of story. See ya. .",10
"This was the first movie that I remember as a little kid. When I saw it, i was captivated by the perfect acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I thought all the prisoners were actually prisoners serving life sentences. It was the first Steven King movie I've ever seen, and it gave me the wrong impression about his type of movies.

The movie is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the man she was having an affair with. Andy is sent to jail were he tries to survive a new life behind bars. The movie shows his struggles with the inmates and prison officials. His closest friend being Red (Morgan Freeman) also shares those same struggles as Andy. And the movie has the most powerful ending of any movie I've ever seen.

I can say that everyone that has seen this movie truly loves it for every aspect of it. The Acting, directing, and writing, etc.",7
"i first saw this movie on tv many years ago. i loved it from the start. ever since then i have seen clips and quotes from it all over my daily life. watching it again, i realize how truly wonderful it is. not only is the acting some of the best i have ever seen, the script is very well written and the message it gives stays with you. this movie is the best i have ever seen.",9
Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest flicks I have ever seen. Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins put on an award-winning performance. I think this film would have received more Academy Awards if the subject matter had not been so dark and it had not been facing Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. I watch this film time and time again and still have the same anxiety of the first time. I have ruined three video tapes of the Shawshank Redemption by excessive viewing. Each purchase of a new tape is worth it!,10
"Low budget, weak at the box office, winless at the Academy Awards, and often considered a weak and clitched film. It's too bad that the greatest film ever made is also the most underrated.

The Shawshank Redemption is the story of Ellis Redding (Red), and his views on life, society, and an inmate named Andy Dufresne.

The story is flawless, the score is memorable, the cinematography is splendid, and the movie flows at a smooth pace all the way through its three hour length. While it often appears to be a weak film at first glance, it really just requires multiple viewings. After several viewings, anyone can begin to realize its greatness.

While movie critics can keep calling Citizen Kane the greatest, I realize it doesn't come close to so much as comparing to Shawshank. Citizen Kane doesn't let its viewers relate to its character, think his every thought, walk his every step, or breathe his every breath. Citizen Kane is a puzzling and riveting masterpiece, but like most ""greats"", it doesn't compare to The Shawshank Redemption.

The Shawshank Redemption is leagues away from any film I've ever seen in terms of greatness. It is timeless, memorable, original, and ultimately the best film I probably will ever see.",10
"This film's high ranking on IMDB is both a testimony to its greatness and a spotlight on how embarrassingly out of touch the Oscar Academy is.

Congratulations to all of those involved in making one of the truly greatest films of all time.",10
"This movie is absolutely perfect. If you have not yet seen it, you must get up from the computer and rush to the video store NOW. It is a wonderfully crafted tale of hope and the human spirit. I love this movie, and consider it the #1 movie of all time. I feel sorry for you if you have not yet seen it.",10
"I have seen many movies in my day and none top The Shawshank Redemption. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are spectacular. The story is told from a narration given by Freeman who plays the character ""Red"", a prisoner who befriends Tim Robins character Andy Dufrain. It is a tremendous story of human triumph. As the movie rises to an incredible climax you will find yourself pumping your fist in the air in delight. This is a movie I never get tired of watching again and again and each time I feel delighted. A true masterpiece!",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie that has kept my attention from the first to the one hundredth time that I have watched it. This was the first movie I had ever seen Tim Robbins in and I have like him ever since. Not too often can I watch a movie over and over again, but this one does it for me. It is a very powerful movie with many touching parts. Great movie overall...if you have never seen it before, I highly recommend it.",9
"There's not much left to say about this film. Saw it last night for about the fifth time and I am still as impressed as I was seeing it the first time in cinema. Intelligent, moving, funny, and sad, this movie is just perfect. Freeman and Robbins are brilliant, so are the supporting characters. Too bad that there are not many more films like this one. A must see for everyone!",8
Words cannot describe this movie. I feel this is the best escape/prison movie ever made. The analogy to the human situation is uncanny and it is this fact that makes this movie great and not just very good. Now I know what it means to be institutionalized. ESCAPE WHILE YOU CAN !!!,10
"Our world can be like that scary prison. A place where life is monotonous and crazy. Moving on a straight path to death. But only this hope will help us get out of the prison of the world and break this cycle. ""Hope"" may be considered the last weapon of mankind. Philosophers describe hope as something that keeps us alive psychologically and makes us wait for the sunrise with joy instead of sadness. Hope means the confidence we have in our current situation. Even if we are stuck in a painful hell, hope promises a time when everything will be better. Well, we're not going to be caught in hell now, are we? We all know hell as a place full of ugly demons, endless torture, and painful death and resurrection. Such a place may belong to another world, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" takes us to a real hell on earth: prison.

The prison in The Shawshank Redemption may not be absolute hell, but it is the most hellish part of the planet. Some thinkers think that existence consists of three levels: the highest level is heaven and the lowest level is hell, and the human world is in between these two and contains elements from both upper and lower levels. Earth can be as painful as hell and as pleasurable as heaven for humans. When Andy Dufrin walks into prison, the old-timers make a bet on which of the fresh fish will cry first. The first person to cry is beaten so badly by the prison captain that he dies. This is how we get to know the dual state of the prison (earth). The head of the prison introduces the most important rule of the prison to the new arrivals: respect the Lord and never use his name for trivial things. Then he continues: ""God protects your soul, but your body is mine."" Although the head of the prison seems to be a God-fearing man and in other circumstances he should treat the prisoners better, but his words and behavior are completely different from each other.",10
"Great movie, I don't know how I missed it. Nothing was out of place, whoever casted the movie did an excellent job.It instantly became one of my top 5's. I will watch it again(I don't usually watch twice, at least right away). I'm glad I bought the DVD -can't say that about all movies.",10
The movie was filled with inspiration and hope. Great script and acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freemen. I can never get tired of watching this amazing film. An amazing well written screen play and camera shots too. I recommend everybody to see this film!,10
"This movie has everything - hope and dreams, twists and humor, horror and happiness, success and failure. It is so many stories to so many people. I have seen all but the first 10 minutes 100 times, since every time I am surfing the cable channels and see it I stop and watch it, usually until the end. A fantastic story.",7
One of the best movies in the world. Still in 2019 an very impressive movie.,10
It was one of the best movies I've seen in my life.,10
This is a very well made movie. I like it. Not much to say about it.,10
"I never seen the Movie like This Before.. So, Its Really Cool Movie. Thank you all..",10
This film is encreible the best film in te word. I like this film,9
I hope I can make it get across the border I hope I can see my friend and shake his hand I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dream. I hope.....!,10
"I have watched this movie more than 10 times and still I'm speechless. This movie gives me strength to live in hard times. After watching this movie first time I always speak to myself that don't give up HOPE. But it's very much hard to find friend like Red or maybe prototype like him in real world. This movie gives me strength to move on and never forget those people who left you in in your bad time, so when the RIGHT time comes you can smack them hard. Always love to watch this movie whenever I get time.",10
"So what about this great surprise? This film is a true masterpiece of cinematic history. This great feat will teach you life and what's better than this !!! By seeing this unique film, you will understand the meaning of life, and this film will take you to a world beyond the boundaries of movies and cinema...i love this movie and i am sure you will love this movie too..thank make my dream",8
This is good movie I ever seen and more suspence scenes here in movie,6
"Back in high school, I had an English class where we read the short story by Stephen King and then watched the movie. The short story is wonderfully to read by itself. However, the movie manages to both perfectly capture the whole feel and atmosphere of the original story, and improve upon it. It is rare for a movie to be better than the book, yet everyone agreed it was so. In the movie, many of the characters are more developed, and the warden is made much more crooked. Much of the narration is directly from the short story, but the parts that are not blend perfectly. It is a long movie, with little action and no special effects, yet it is always mesmerizing and beautiful, a movie about hope, with an incredible surprise ending. I still feel cheated because I read the story first and knew the ending before I ever saw the movie.",10
"Shawshank Redemption , Best-rated Film of All Time Huffington",10
Freeman brings the story to life in this cinematic classic!,10
I can't believe I haven't watched it before it's my regret but also I'm happy to seen this movie when I am grown up,10
"Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that hope is a precious and buoyant emotion which can give our lives substance and meaning.

The Shawshank Redemption is based on a novella by Stephen King. Tim Robbins plays Andy, a banker who is sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. The judge who sentences him finds him ""a particularly remorseless and icy man."" Andy's cool reserve and aloofness is not accepted well by the other inmates at Shawshank maximum-security prison in Maine. He is raped by some angry men and given several long stretches in solitary confinement for his bad attitude.

Luckily, Andy is befriended by Red, played by Morgan Freeman, the prison fixer. He is awed by this young man's quiet reserve and inward resolve to make the best of his bad situation. Andy's accounting skills come in handy, and he begins doing the taxes for the guards and laundering money for the corrupt warden. This lands him the cushy job of librarian. Eventually, Andy wrangles money out of state officials to build the best prison library anywhere.

Writer and director Frank Darabont draws out strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as soulmates who support each other while doing hard time. Red sees hope as a dangerous thing that can drive a man insane, but Andy believes it is fuel that keeps one going against all odds. The Shawshank Redemption is a jubilant tribute to hope as an essential quality of soul.",10
The year 1994 was full of great movies. like this movie but i thing forrest gump was better the 1995 oscar winner I recommend to watch that,10
Its was okay i suppose! not really something im personally into,10
This movie deserves to be spotted n1 The acting it has the actors the drama the story every minute is enjoyable in this movie i like it but not my favourite.,10
"Shawshank Redemption is famously one of the greatest movies of all time, maybe even the best. Along with being one of the best it is also one of the most human, the most real, the most heartfelt, and the most impactful film. I've seen people change their lives and perspectives over the message Shawshank is trying give. I've seen this movie nearly 15 times now and everytime I watch it, I notice something new about it that I can apply to my life. It sticks in your head. When you're done with the movie, you don't leave and think, ""Well that was neat"". You leave with the intention to do and be better.

Right now, we have a lot of ""harmless movies"", movies that have you leaving the theater thinking, ""That scene was cool"" or ""That was funny"", leaving with no real impact, just a memory of two harmless hours of entertainment. It's the same stuff over and over and doesn't leave you thinking about the core aspects of the movie or how it can apply to your life. These stories are barely stories. Shawshank is not one of these stories.

There's a reason why Shawshank Redemption is IMDb's favorite, or why it sits on the shelf of the Library of Congress, or why it's considered a modern classic and a masterpiece, or why it's symbol of humanized hope and a prime example of a great film. Discover these reasons for yourself. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",10
"It is one among the best movies ever made in World Cinema and applauded by many film critics. This film was directed by Frank Darabont who adopted the storyline from Stephen King's Novel - 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'

The best thing about this movie is, we experience it with the narration in the background voiceover by Morgan Freeman. It actually helps to bring in the emotional connect with the audience along with some great messages about life, hope, trust and positive attitude. If we look at from technical aspects, we can certainly experience the great work of lighting and camera with an amazing twisted climax scene.",10
An amazing story with a great narrator throughout in Morgan Freeman. There's tragedy and irony and wraps up in a very satisfying and pleasing way !,10
I watched this movie a long time ago and I only can say it is a masterpiece!,10
"In people's descriptions of films, the terms ""best"", ""favorite"", ""great"", ""a classic"" and the like often get bandied about with no real meaning. I've heard someone describing ten different movies, and refer to all ten as the best movies he'd ever seen, all within the span of five minutes.

But with The Shawshank Redemption, those words most definately have meaning. This movie is, quite simply, the single most masterful film I have ever seen. It is completely and utterly amazing, and I have never seen a movie that has surpassed it. Others have come close, but none can match the sheer power of The Shawshank Redemption. Words simply don't do justice to the emotions I feel each time I watch this film, and I am left in awe of how profound it is.

To anyone who has not seen this flawless gem, you are missing out on the single greatest film ever made. Film is Art, and The Shawshank Redemption is the film equivalent of a DaVinci, a Michaelangelo, or a Rembrant. It is simply amazing.",10
The movie Shawshank redemption is the one of the favourite films I ever watched. The slow base movie and climax attracted me to this movie this movie gives us a feel good impression. I suggest this movie to people those who ready to watch slow base and feel good movies,10
"At the first, I'm not really interesting with this movie but my friend always recommend it,so I watched this movie and realized that this movie is perfect hollywood movie. When I first see it, I am to young to understand all the things the movie what to show us but this movie gave me a different feeling.

The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont in 1994. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King Novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption The movie is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place. This movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meants for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system.

The movie had inspiring story,this is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion,from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. The Shawshank Redemption is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. Redemption is what this story is all about. And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have commited,but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life. What emerges in this movie can only be called a magnificent pice of art.

Overall, this movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting pefect,emotional drama perfect,soundtrack perfect,storyline perfect, and everything about this movie is perfect. The Shawshank Redemption is the movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I think this movie reccomended for everyone who like drama,action, and humor cause this film blend it.",8

"One of the finest films ever made, this movie is a sheer work of art. It's a poignant story of hope. That's what makes this film much more than just a movie. It tells a lesson about life. It's a narrative about freedom, friendship and patience. The Plot is average, but the story-telling, acting and cinematography are the reasons that make the movie, memorable. The director Frank Darabont has been flawless with his work. The story is about Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbings through the eyes of Red (played by Morgan Freeman, in his best role ever). Andy is wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Although nothing much happens in the way of plot for 2hours, in a movie having a playing time of 2hrs 22minutes, you would never get bored. I won't give any spoilers, in case you haven't seen it yet. Just go and watch it. You will not be disappointed. There is no way, it is highly overrated. Its topmost position in IMDb ratings is the evidence. ---------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one movie I never tire of watching. 27 times and going strong!!!,10
"Fantastic movie. i enjoyed the movie, i would love to see more of this",10
"The Shawshank redemption is the first Frank Darabont's movie which has taken 7 Oscar-nominations from the Academy but the film not yielded a high profit.Why not? Well,the story of this movie is too good to be true.

The Shawshank redemption is based on the book by Stephen King and certainly this is the most brilliant adaptation which has ever based from the writer'novels. The playtime is rather long but seems to be not boring.It's excellently produced,and the acting(Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman)is marvellous.The script is clever enough about the human's relationships and the escape from the prison.The characters and the story itself are clearly true.",8
This movie was good it illustrated how complex humans are to have to be forced to write fake reviews in order to be able to watch a show that they cannot find anywhere else.,10
"This movie is one of those you need to watch, if you think you know society. As the plot grows Andy becomes the center of attention for the prisoners and warden. Finally having the chance to be free, it is ripped from him in a shocking discovery, he really didn't kill his wife!

The Shawshank Redemption gives an ode to movie viewers and enthusiasts since the film is based on a true story. Liken the film to war veteran on the verge of escaping his enemies stronghold after years of captivity. Finally as Andy tunnels, and climbs his way to freedom, he gets the sweetest satisfaction of knowing he can now start his life again.",10
"Really good movie, you should definetley watch it. has agreat plot. incredible graphich and a well writtem script",10
There is a movie that you should watch throughout your life,10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.

But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.

Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.",9
"It doesn't get much better than this. Perfect performances throughout, wonderful direction... just amazed it didn't do well when first released. Time put it in its rightful place though... top of the tree!",6
"Great movie, amazing messages, fabulous quotes.

Definitely will recommend watching it any any time.

My favorite quote is ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really: Get busy living, or get busy dying.""",5
"Ooh yeah, i found it after 18 years later the greatest movie ever",10
"I watched that when I was a kid , I did not remmeber the name tho till Im 19",10
I just watch it so many times very nice.I can watch it to death,10
"Deserved first place,very nice movie i just watching it so many times :)",10
One of the best film I have ever seen. The plot was decent and narration drives you into it's world but finally delivers an unexpected thrill to viewers,10
One of the all time classics. Not to be missed or overlooked. Trust me! The music is particularly powerful.,10
"I guess not many people will ever read this, but I just feel obliged to praise this work of art. I am an aspiring Neuropsychology student and obviously an extreme positivist. Man IS A MACHINE. Yet, The Shawshank Redemption DEFINES what BEING A HUMAN is! That is the reason why it is the best film ever made. It inspires hope, meaning, aspiration... whatever you would like to call it.

I wouldn't say that it inspired me to be less scientific in my view of life, it's just that it made me feel better about life. I am still very much in the physiological pure hard scientific corner of psychology. What I guess I'm trying to say is that this movie MUST put things into a rather mature perspective, even to the most rebellious and unreasonable nihilist on the face of this planet.

This movie is simplistic, the story isn't intricate, it is subtle and very very very easy to follow. Yet, it resides in that category of movies that include the likes of Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction and Forest Gump; it actually sits on the throne there. The essence of this movie is bigger than the discovery of Special Relativity, in that it gives an answer to the question that you are faced with when hearing the short line of sweet dialog: ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice really: get busy liven or get busy die'n"". ""What is the meaning of life?""",5
Very good movie love it . gives a good understanding of life and very well directed,9
"Tens of thousands of IMDB users couldn't be wrong, this movie REALLY IS THE BEST. I am an avid movie watcher, and I LOVE this movie. I rate it as a 20 out of a possible 10.

The scene on the beach at the end is the best, it makes me cry every time!

Make sure you own it!",10

The best storyline you could ever hope for. The scene when he gets out and find out that his former fellow suicided after being released and craved his name on the wooden bar in the ceiling is always make me cry.,10
"It is not my favourite movie ever but it works for almost everyone. That is saying a lot. It has emotion and it is difficult for me to find a movie so moving as this one, without being manipulative and cheesy. Hollywood seems stuck in creating much noise at first glance and being empty at posterior views. Here, it worked for me since the first view. The emotion is always there, sometimes taken from the dialogue, or from the soundtrack, or the unexpected direction the movie takes.",10
"It is so good , i love , we should make more movies like that",9
I saw this movie for first time in 2016 with no pation only for interesting and see first time morgan freeman in his performance as always great and with temper of sound and dialouge was great the end was not bad and i think will get 8 after all,9

This is a profound depiction of friendship and redemption, a n inspiring film that everyone should watch, because it has the power to uplift your spirit.",9
The Shawshank Redemption is by FAR my favorite movie. It is the touchstone or benchmark I judge all other movies by. It has everything I love about movies and nothing that I usually hate. This is the only movie I think I can give a rating of 10.,10
It's great Movie that i have ever seen when i was child,10
"This is more of an appreciation to ""The Shawshank Redemption"", as if there were a high score than 10, I would have clicked it. In the history of penitentiary films, this one is on my top list, moreover, I find it a little influenced by the story of Papillon, however, have not read about this inspiration; thus if it exists, I would be proud of my theory.",10
There is not a single moment in this movie that makes it boring. Tears in my eyes. What a great ending. Don't know what more to say.,10
"Shawshank Redemption is a defining moment in cinema.

The movie (directed by Frank Darabont) takes a straight-forward, soul- searching novel by horror icon Stephen King and transforms it into a somber, bloated prison drama designed to fill you up with inspiration.

Thanks to supreme performances and beautiful cinematography, you get that inspirational jump-start frame after frame. And you get generous helpings of the novella's deft ironic humour about a inmate quietly turning a corrupt system against itself.

A small box office release which made its name once released on home video, this movie is well worth a watch if you happened to have missed it first time around.",9
For me this is one of my best movie of all time what is interesting about this movie is how the events are more and more intense and exciting to reach an end that is blowing and satisfying. this movie has a well written story and it is full of lessons that can change how you see life it also has many quotes that will stick in your brain and make you think about them very long and sometimes compare your view to life to those of the characters in the movie. the acting is of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is just amazing.,10
"I don't understand how this movie managed to get to Number one on this site. While it's a good movie with talented actors, it's just not as entertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top ranking.

I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn't deserve the 1/10 rating I've given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just isn't as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as 'Trainspotting', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Donnie Darko' for example.

These movies are solid performances with a strong theme in one direction, while I feel that The Shawshank Redemption flounders around with it's, slightly lame, hope and friendship theme, thats just not as entertaining as others.",4
Will forever be known for an amazing piece of work.,10
This is one of those movies that I will watch whenever I come across it. Fantastic acting and a surprisingly suspenseful tale. Highly recommend this movie for everyone.,10

"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.Based on a Stephen King novel,this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film.Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise.This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor - Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career.Bravo to this brilliant modern day classic!... drcrnt",10

What all you need to watch this masterpiece.

Before this movie pulp fiction was my no 1 film and I never imagined that I am going to change my mind for it , but after I saw this my mind changed and I want to say that this is the best work I have ever seen.

A must watch for everyone this film will teach you a good lesson about life.",10

"The shawshank redemption is my favorite movie for many reasons, from the great acting to the great plot progression.",10
"Basically as the title says, this movie is my favorite of all time.",10
"Hello, my name is Ed and I would like to say that at first this movie looked kind of stupid when I was at Block Buster but I remembered that at IMDB it got a 9.0 rating and is the 2nd best movie of all time so I rented it. When I got home I watched it and I was amazed by it. This movie is incredible. The movie is not really about prison but about people and the hardships they face and endure. While I was watching it there were several parts of the movie where you think it is over but there is realy more to see which was great because you don't want this movie to end. The story unfolds and more stuff is going on in the movie then you think. My advice for anyone who wants to see the greatest movie ever is to go out and either rent this movie or buy it. It is worth it. You wont get sick of this masterpiece.",10
"Not exactly a movie you would think to have Stephen King in the credits, which gives the film a sense of irony. When watching the film, one experiences many emotions, and though not enough to make most people cry, enough to leave you reeling. Our hero Andy (Tim Robbins)quite frankly goes through a lot, but is steered toward the right direction because of his undying hope of getting out. Andy also leads fellow inmate Red (Morgan Freeman) ""to the light"", and teaches us all how important hope is to have within us. I guess another good point is just how many films can you name that have happy endings, and aren't in any way at least slightly corny?",10
"If this movie isn't a masterpiece, then nothing is. The story and the actors feel very real and they just charm you from the very beginning. You can feel all the emotions that appear in the movie, when something is unfair you just want to break an expensive object and when something good happens you sit there, smiling like a little sun. Tim Robbins is excellent for the part of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman couldn't have been a better choice for the speaker and the role itself.

Even though the movie is full of surprises it allows you to figure out a few things yourself every now and then. But in the long run it consists of many unbelievable twists and turns and there's just not one boring second. I'm not surprised about the rating either, this movie just deserves to be as high up on all lists as a movie possibly can be. If you haven't seen it, you know what I want you to do next.",10
Probably my favourite movie of all time with great messages. Definitely a movie everyone should see in their lifetimes.,10
"I was very skeptical of how everyone rate this movie very high but after I watching it, I can confirm it is indeed of the best stories told in any movie.",9
Definitely win your heart and worth watching and story acting cast editing all blow your mind away,9
Something to watch again with my son soon! It gave a lot of lessons and it is just real for me,10
"If you have never watched such movies, I would strongly recommend that you follow a very successful quality surely",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" stands tall as a cinematic gem, a powerful and emotionally gripping masterpiece that leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of its viewers. Directed by Frank Darabont, this adaptation of Stephen King's novella is a triumph of storytelling, featuring brilliant performances, a poignant narrative, and a profound exploration of the human spirit.

Set within the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, the film introduces us to Andy Dufresne, portrayed with remarkable depth by Tim Robbins. Wrongfully convicted of murder, Andy embarks on an arduous journey through the prison system, enduring its hardships while clinging to an unwavering sense of hope. Robbins effortlessly portrays Andy's quiet resilience, making him an unforgettable protagonist whose unwavering spirit captivates audiences from the very beginning.

Morgan Freeman delivers a career-defining performance as Red, a seasoned inmate and narrator of the story. Freeman's soothing voice and wise portrayal add a layer of richness to the film, serving as the perfect counterpoint to Andy's unwavering optimism. The bond that forms between Andy and Red is the heart and soul of the film, embodying the true essence of friendship and the strength it provides in the darkest of times.

At its core, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a story of hope and the indomitable human spirit. Through its vivid characters and thought-provoking dialogues, the film delves into themes of perseverance, friendship, and the quest for redemption. It reminds us that even in the most desolate circumstances, hope can be a powerful force that propels individuals toward transformation and renewal.

The film's cinematography paints a hauntingly beautiful portrait of life behind bars. The use of shadows and contrasts adds an atmospheric depth to the prison setting, mirroring the characters' emotional turmoil and yearning for freedom. Every shot is a visual delight, allowing viewers to immerse themselves fully in the world of Shawshank.

The screenplay, penned by Darabont himself, exhibits a perfect balance of humor and heartache, culminating in a story that leaves no emotional stone unturned. Each character, no matter how small their role, serves a purpose in the larger narrative, contributing to the film's emotional resonance and making it a truly unforgettable experience.

Accompanied by an evocative score composed by Thomas Newman, the film's music elevates every scene, evoking a range of emotions that stay with the audience long after the credits roll. The combination of captivating storytelling and a haunting musical score forms a harmonious blend that weaves its way into the hearts of its viewers.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless classic that transcends generations, reminding us of the power of hope, friendship, and the human capacity for redemption. It remains an enduring testament to the strength of the human spirit, leaving an eternal impression that will continue to inspire and touch lives for years to come. A cinematic triumph that should not be missed, this film stands as a shining example of the transformative power of cinema.",9

There are some People with some bad rewiews.... They are not even Humans, they are monsters disguised as Humans :)))... GO ahead and watch this movie, you have nothing to lose, you Will get inspired, happy, and that great message from it and realize what the world really is ! But Also a little sad...

Amazing movie definitely one too see and too see how is was in those prisons.,9
There is not a movie better than this. This movie is simply the best movie ever made and it can not be argued.,10
"This is a fantastic film and deserved the countless awards that it was given during the 1990's! The film is visually astounding with a fantastic cast of legendary actors. Films that have twists are always impressive and Frank Darabont does this film justice by creating an original and at times, very moving screenplay. I would suggest that anyone watches this film as it takes its audience on a roller-coaster of emotions from pity towards Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) at the start of this movie when he is convicted of murdering his wife, to the moving performance by James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen, the lonely and 'institutionalised' old prisoner.

The ending made me cry and made me want to go and visit the 'big hayfield up near Buxton'!! I must have watched this film hundreds of times and I still get nervous when Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) goes into Andy Dufresne's cell and realises something astounding about the prisoner...",10

One of the best movie ever made! This can change ones life style !,10
When I was searching for a thriller and suspense.i got about shwashank redemption.. when I was this movie at first time.i was really shocked about story of this movie and suspension of story. that day I was make a big fan of Hollywood's movie.,10
"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this maudlin Hollywood package. The storyline is predictable; the characters and performances are one-dimensional; the dialogue is absolutely embarrassing (""Prison is not a fairy tale."" Ya think?!) If it would have been about women instead of men, it would have been dismissed as the schmaltzfest that it is. It isn't even courageous enough to admit that it is a gay love story. Tim Robbins should be ashamed to have taken part, for his performance was the most wooden I'd seen since Daryl Hannah in (insert any 80s movie she appeared in here). Morgan Freeman was even more dreadful and has been giving the same dreadful performance ever since. I don't expect much depth from Stephen King-inspired movies, but ""Children of the Corn"" was insightful in comparison to this dribble.",10
For all the people who never watch this masterpiece .... YOU SHOULD WATH IIIIT .,10

What can i say. Its just awesome. Grt acting. Grt story. Its just awesome. Till date i didnt watch this sort of film in my life.,9
"A phenomenal film. A rare gem that surpasses entertainment, resonating with meaning and enlightenment. The film, and the Stephen King novella it derives from, are a treasure. Even if you're not a big reader, seek out Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. It's contained in a collection of 4 novellas - one for each season. After you've seen the film, it should be apparent which season Shawshank is allocated. The book also has enough deviations, including a different ending, to keep you enthralled even if you've seen the film several times.",10
I find movies where you lose track of time are the best,9
It's cool but i have a probelm with subtitles and that I don't like,10

"NICE ONE, EXCELLENT STORY.rEALLY i LIKE IT VERY MUCH.",10
"This is one the best movies I've ever seen. The acting, writing and production was impeccable. I'd watch this movie over and over again.",10
I would watch it over and over again. This is on e the best movies I've ever seen.,10
"When someone who has never seen this asks why this is my favorite movie - I never know what to tell them. It's the perfect movie, it's like God decided to allow the creators, writers, and actors to blend perfectly together - with the end result being the greatest movie ever written. The first time I saw it, I thoroughly enjoyed it but didn't allow for the intake of dramatic genius to fully set in. I have seen it over 100 times since I first 'experienced' it, and now it is impossible for me to watch any scene without getting chills down my spine. Frank Darabont should have a day made in his name for his adaptation of Stephen King's compelling and brilliant story. No one could have surmised that allowing for one of the more likable inmates to be killed would make the movie even MORE powerful...but he did. One last thing...I just wanted to thank God for allowing them to change the ending to that of a diminishing Robbins and Freeman at the end, no words needed.",9
"With L.A. Confidential running a close second, this is the best film in a surprisingly good decade for movies. Finally, somebody gets Stephen King right. The film is based on one of his short novellas, and director Frank Darabont absolutely nails it. Of course, he has a lot of help from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows. All give amazing performances. Throw in Darabont's screenplay, Roger Deakins' cinematography, and Thomas Newman's score, and you have a bonafide masterpiece. If you don't dig this movie, please check your pulse.

It's a real shame Hollywood did not know how to market this back in 1994, because word-of-mouth came too late for the film to make money or win the Oscars it deserves. So when you see Shawshank for the first time, you'll wonder how in the hell Forrest Gump won best picture. To this day, I've never left a movie theater feeling better than when I saw The Shawshank Redemption.",10
"It's a movie you must watch, enjoy and learn from how to not lose hope, identity and to be unbreakable",10
"This movie i don't know how did i miss it. heard from no one at all. N e ways not many good movies are subject of talking in India and 2 days ago i was searching IMDb ( which i know since just a few days ago ) and i got this movie name a couple of times in few titles...guess what thought of renting it to give a try to IMDb and OH MY GOSH I know i am writing about a movie which is more than 10 years old...but Oh my its kind of 4:00 am now and i have just finished watching this..and man this is for sure in my Top 5 movies of all times ( u know i just don't have Hollywood movies in my list but bollywood movies too ) and it makes it to Top 5 explains that what a great movie this is...

The story is simple...but boy try to do some guessing work here and if u succeed tell me...Morgan Freeman is phenomenal actor. This movie is his legendary work...the other guy ...i am seeing him for first time..and i kind of believe now that he is great actor..

But all credit goes to the Director and the Writer of this wonderful movie...Such a simple story told so powerfully and controlled so amazingly ..is just great.

This one sure gives hope to most hopeless people in world...

Watch it guys if u still haven't ...this is best Hollywood can give u ...believe me and zillion fans...

and now i have to specially thank IMDb and fans of this movie on IMDb...its u who recommended me this amazing movie...thnx so much...",9
This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.,10
......I was recommended to watch this God.awful movie,10
"That Red had his back from when they met, climbing out that sewer pipe not me",10
"The whole movie is inspirational,but why redemption?",8
"The whole movie is inspirational,but why redemption",9
"Free is in the sun leisurely to breathe. For us, it's like air, and you don't usually think about what it's like to lose it, but for an elite youth who has lost a loved one and is permanently locked up in prison for no reason, it's a fatal blow.",10
Very good it is one the best movie i have ever seen in my life,9
Good movie! it's good to watch on a rainy day at a saturday night. recommended,10
This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.,9
"A banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all",10
"One of Stephen King's BEST adaptations (one of the best I've seen anyways). Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give all-star performances, it has a really good story line, and the directing, producing, music score...etc. all comes together quite well and really shows off King's talent for storytelling. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think I even have any cons for this this one. No bad acting, no weird camera shots, no mistakes (as far as i know) but maybe I will watch it again and re-edit my review accordingly. Maybe I missed something? Or maybe it really IS flawless? That is just my opinion, so watch it for yourselves and form your own. :D",10
Even if you loved marvel or Dc movies Shawshank will top my listing for sure.,10
Nice (only doing it for my profile checkout) Should watch though,10
"I remember when i was i kid, my granda watch this film and i watch too. But i watched again with my family(mom,dad,youngers) month ago. It still surprisingly and heartbreaking , shocking. And very heart melt ending is safe that film ahh goddamn it ,maybe i'll watch it again with my own family again",10
"I think this is one of the best films ever made, Morgan freeman is ameizing, is hard to understand life without the final outcome",10
"Over and over and over, it's one of the movies you never get tired of. Everytime you watch, you will see or hear something different.",9
An integrated movie in all respects in my opinion is the best movie I have seen so far and it is difficult to abandon this opinion unless there is a shock coming,10
"If you have ever watched shows like Prison Break then you would not be amazed much with The Shawshank Redemption. It would rather tell you a reality of a prisoner's life after living long in a prison.

Institutionalised as they say, rehabilitated as they laugh.",10
"I am in love with this movie , this one has all the action , thriller and all thing which I think it must have",10
"If intention is what counts, A Dream of Freedom is a great film, especially when it focuses on showing the strong friendship of the protagonists. One of the most beautiful friends ever portrayed in the movies. A movie that is very exciting, With great interpretations of great actors",10
Everyone told me to watch this movie I am just wondering how good this is.,9
"Immensely enjoyed the movie! The acting was very good. It, also, helped me to view people in prison more compassionately. I loved Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in this. Morgan Freeman is an outstanding actor.",10
This Video is Veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Gooooooooooooood . Thank you for taking the trouble to help me.I do appreciate it.,10
"Shawshank Redemption has superb performances, a good script and interesting story all leading to a deep emotional climax! One of the best film.",8
The Shawshank Redemption(1994) the best movie of all time ever,10
A very good movie. The story line is very nice. The movie teaches about life lessons in every dark times we face..,10

"I have seen this movie many times and I still get that wonderful feeling every time I see it. I love it so much that I have so far bought 6 vcds for my friends and they all love it. And if you want to know why, just see it for yourself.",6
It's a must watch movie . The storyline is amazing . I can say that you will not regret watching this .,10
"Quite simply the best film it has been my pleasure to have watched. When it first came out at the cinema in the mid nineties, it wasn't tremendously successful, however as a regular cinema goer at the time, I was lucky enough to see this magnificent film. As soon as I left the cinema, I promptly recommended this film to everyone I knew. As soon as the video and then the DVD was released, it was purchased immediately and watched and re-watched several times. Even though I know the entire storyline and all the twists etc, I still watch the film whenever it comes on TV. I still watch the DVD at least a couple of times a year, some would call it sad, however it totally deserves the title of 'My Favourite Film'",10
"It is an all time -classic movie to watch ! The acting , plots and intensity of characters , inspiring in many ways . A beautiful film which is a must watch for all out there 💙",10
"A film that will make you cry and with it a sense of satisfaction after witnessing a once in a lifetime film. Amazing direction, amazing cast, a story of freedom and the price you pay for it. A story about good vs evil, a story about life, a lesson you will forever keep with you. An experience that you would most definitely want to share with others. It provides us with a lot of talking points. Other movies show us hasty and artificial emotions but this movie slows you down and completely immerses you. The progression of the story is something that feels natural. Very in depth film, about hope and friendship in a lifetime.",9
"I have to be honest, this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen!",9
The best movie i've ever seen!...Most motivationa.. And inspiring!!,10
Mind-blowing film with nice motivation for human psychologist.,9
Seems Interesting I'll watch this when I'm Free. :3 free reviews XD.,10
"I sure whenever i saw this, i feel the fun and act. The real fun is here without any action. Everyone on this earth has their own freedom.",10
"This movie provides everything what is needed to be inspired to achieve one's goal in life, if it doesn't inspire you or doesn't teach you about the greatest lesson on patience then nothing will...talking about movie It's a all time masterpiece...A must watch for anyone.",10
"I was recommended to see the film by my friend, and it did not disappoint me. Both the content and the plot and the performance of the actors were excellent. It is easy to be moved by actors when watching, which makes people feel the same way. In general, I am very satisfied with this film and I like it very much. I will recommend it to my friends",10
"this film is possibly one of the greatest all time, anyone who watches and thinks it is bad, they need shooting, love this film and can watch it loads of times and not get bored. upsetting at some points but still amazing. Morgan Freeman's character Red loved, him, he saw things on a different side, and a more realistic side, whereas, Andy saw things as a more fantasising which he always believed could come true. There are points in the film which many would say, i have seen this before or we all know wot is going to happen, but in this film, you never know wot to expect, there are many points which are very unexpected. To end this, my word on it is amazing, i loved the film, and if this is not considered one of the best films of all time then i don't know what could be.",10
"This movie is highly underrated and thought of as just another ""new guy in prison"" type of movie but, the messages of friendship make this movie one in a million. The movie chronicles Andy Dufrasne, a man wrongly convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. He meets ""Red"" a man who can get ""anything for anybody"" which is a common role in prison movies he even says, ""there must be one like me in every prison"". These unlikely friends help save each other in the end, Andy saves Red's soul, which was calloused from prison life. And Red saved Andy, teaching him all he needed to know about prison life. Although there is some lude remarks and alcohol consumption in the movie, the good definately outweighs the bad in this case.",10
This is just a gem of a movie...Best film i have ever seen,10
"He Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover.",6
Best movie i have ever seen. This movie is completely different from the rest of the movies i've seen. The actors were outstanding. They gave their 100%. Dramatization was on point. 10/10,9
This is a masterpiece. It shows that the patience is the key of success How the character shows the patience is invaluable.,10
"One of the greatest movies ever made. Good action, better cast and the best end of this magnificient movie.",9
Everyone said that this movie is the best movie. That's why I also watched this movie. But it can't fulfill my expectation. The story was common to me. But this film has some message for us. Happy watching.,10
"One of the reasons why the full title of the Stephen King novella, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" was not employed was because there was a perception in Hollywood that the film was actually going to be a biopic of Rita Hayworth. Indeed, Frank Darabont even received solicitations of audition requests from several actresses and supermodels and their agents about playing the lead.",9
Best Prison Break Movie! It is a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,9
"The best movie of all time Everything is perfect, well written ,stunning actors performance and touch my feeling",10
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best classic movie ever directed by Frank Darabont.,10
My all time favorite movie..I Inspired Morgan freeman,10
Best Movie With The Best Close Ending Ever Seen Although Its So Old But It Kept making Me Go Back And see it.,10
"Great directing, great acting, great story line, great movie. Nothing to dislike about this movie, you can watch it from the beginning to the end and enjoy every minute of it.",9
I like this movie very much. Nice act by everyone. I really like this,10
"There's a reason why The Shawshank Redemption is top of so many film lists. It is a brilliant adaptation of the book by Stephen King. It captures the eloquence of his words and brings the characters to life. You care about the people in this film, and you're hurt when they are hurting. You want them to succeed, and the pay-off more than justifies the journey. If you haven't seen this film, why not watch it next?",10
Story is exciting and realistic While acting is great. The length is a bit too long but enjoyable till last minute. I very recommend watching before you think its an old movie or the trailer is not exciting,9
"This is the best story unwrapping I'd ever seen. It left me the feeling of justice I felt so fulfilled with the ending. To be honest, the cinematography isn't that extraordinary but the plot and the screenplay left me out of breath so I didn't give it much of a thought. No need of those things with a story like this and less when it's told this beautifully. I think this is one of the biggest must-watch ever.",10
Sick film mate. sickest film ive ever seen. would not call another one sicker than this,10
Sick film mate its the sickest film ive ever seen would not call a nother one sicker that this,9
It is a mind blowing movie. The emotions that run through after the end are simply inexplicable. What performances and what direction. The best movie of all time.,10
"In the face of reality's ruthlessness and injustice, people are powerless to resist. Patience is the best choice, and then rely on your own wisdom to win the final victory.",9
Excellent Movie!!! I enjoyed it...I strongly recommend it!!!,10
"Honestly this movie is a masterpiece, if you think your life is not working out then you should watch this movie for sure. Not only it is based on hope but shows us how the character improves and develop over time. This movie shows a lot of emotions such as happiness, sadness, inspiration, anger, etc. I really recommend to give it a shot.",10
"The thing that amazes me most about this movie is its perfect pacing. Every time there's some serious crap that goes down, there's always a hopeful or amusing anecdote afterward to pick you back up and get you in the hopeful headspace of Andy Dufresne. A veritable masterpiece in writing, cinematography, and commenting on the human spirit.",9
Most powerful movie of all time. Can't even describe it's greatness and the value it has held for so many years after it's release. The performances are incredible. There is no better movie ever made. This is the greatest ever.,10
This film is it 10/10. Great masterpiece of a prison movie.,10
I really enjoyed this movie and watched it several times...it never gets old. The characters are believable and the story line is honest and believable. Give it a watch...it may become one of your favorites too!,10
"There's no wonder this is one of the best movies ever made. I'm writing this review after watching it for more than five times (if not more).

The acting was excellent, the screenplay was excellent and the script was excellent. I can't fault it.

It's a good all-round movie.",10
"There is ""NOTHING wrong"" with rubbing pancakes all over yourself, but it is not productive. The Shawshank Redemption has about ONE idea in it at best and, if that idea is not fully absorbed after one viewing of this blandsterpiece, further views will be of no use. Ironlion is free to spend their life sitting in front of a screen watching this simple story again and again, just as others are free to point out that this activity is the very definition of a waste of a life: unproductive, uncreative (taking rather than giving), and (let's face it) idiotic.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.",10
After watching this movie I got to why this is the top rated movie ever,10
"Well Well Well, one of the best films made in this century, and of course you get the haters, people who are more interested in the CGI in films like The Transformers, (god bless them with their mental age of 13) .A film with Morgan Freeman in it makes you sit up and take notice, a fine actor, director and narrator. IMHO. Its time to forget the haters on here.Any film with a rating of at least,,,,,6.9 upwards is going to be a cracker of a film",10
"The Count of Monte Cristo isn't a very good book, and has spawned a few pretty poor films, but it's the ideas which make it an enduring story. Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas's (""Dumass's"") book when writing the original short story I don't know - what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically coarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The big step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing. I don't think there's a dull line of dialogue in the movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like 'Braveheart' did in the year 'Shawshank Redemption' was nominated) I'll truly never fathom. Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent: wait ten years then take a vote - that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what's left is worth remembering.",10
"A must watch, truly a masterpiece. The story touches the soul. Watched several times and can still watch this movie 100 more times.",10
I have never ever seen such a nice web series. Waiting for your new project,10
When I think about a movie with character and human feelings I think about Shawshank Redemption. This movie digs deep into raw emotions with the incredible Freeman and Robbins. It's a classic that will last forever.,9
Definitely an all time favorite I'm so glad that I saw this movie growing up even though I was not able to appreciate how great of a movie it was at the time I have re watch the movie multiple times as I got older and now i can appreciate it alot more!,10
All the elements of this movie is perfect. Every actor has given their best. Loved it.,9
This is a very good movie and it has one if the best storyline and plot I have watched this movie so many times and I highly recommend this app to all,10
An impressive movie. Really the story is perfect. You must watch !,10
"The acting, writing, directing, and scenery is amazing. I watch this show every time it comes on the television. I still believe this is simply a story of friendship that triumphs over evil.",10
"Great movie watch it one of the most beautiful, super awesome movies I've watched, it can be watched as a family, I definitely recommend it, it's beyond perfect, it's beautiful.",9
This movie is AWESOME although it's super long! I don't care I can watch it over and over again and not know how old it is.,8
"The Shawshank Redemption is the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. Great movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",9
Mazing i like it amaxzing watch it lol omg hi omg watch it watc it wath what omg mi wai xk,10
"I'd like to start of with saying ""the Shawshank Redemption"" is a very good movie, but I can not give it a 10/10 review. The only movie thats is and proberbly will ever be perfect is the Godfather and Shawshank doesn't even nearly reach that level.",10
Amazing actors acting amazingly. Superb writing and told wonderfully. I love this movie.,9
The Shawshank Redemption is a remarkably compelling film with a powerful message. Maybe for everyone!,9
My favourite film ever! Can watch it every day. Had to watch it twice the first time,9
"It's an ok movie...but the hype isn't really warranted. So many people I know regard this as the greatest movie ever made but it's not. That honour should definitely go to more deserving films such as Blazing Saddles, Mike And Dave Need Weeding Dates or possibly Close Encounters of the Third Kind.",5
I think it's really good overall and I genuinely enjoyed the ending / progression of the piece as a whole.,10
Best movie. It connect with you emotionally. . . . . . . . . . . .,10
This is the most beautifully put together movie I have ever seen. Amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. The message of of hope and the idea of freedom that Andy Dufresne conveys is truly inspiring. One of parts of the movie is the way they show the passage of time.,10
You will enjoy every second of this movie 😉 from start to end,10
This movie is standard for what a basic good entertaining movie should be. Not that much action but it's well put together enough to keep you following the story as it unfolds.,5
I think The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movie in the world. This movie story is just amazing. and the movie plot is very interesting. Just Highly recommend it.,10
"Why do I want to write The Shawshank Redemption's 234th comment? I'm not certain because about everything that could have been said about it has been said. But like so many other commenters, I was and continue to be deeply moved by this understated yet powerful portrayal of friendship, hope, and redemption.

To Kill a Mockingbird is the only other movie I've ever seen that has such a profound impact on me. Having seen both films, I feel better for having done so.

I had no intention of seeing this movie because I typically avoid them and don't like them. When I was checking out The Shawshank Redemption to one of our elderly customers one day while I was working at a branch library, she stated, ""Whenever I feel sad or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always helps me feel better."" That seemed pretty unusual to me at the time. One day, there was nothing on TV but programming that I would never, ever watch or that I had previously seen too many times. I watched it because I recalled what she had said. Since then, I've seen it a ton of times, and each time, it gets better.

Just two men conversing while wearing jail garb-no action, no special effects.

My two favorite films are To Kill a Mockingbird and The Shawshank Redemption. I'm not going to judge it on its technical merits since I don't really care. I've read that The Godfather, Citizen Kane, this movie, or that movie is the best motion picture ever made. They might employ the most advanced techniques or be the most significant films ever produced, but they are not the best. The best movies are the ones that move you emotionally. To touch the soul, a film like The Shawshank Redemption is necessary.",10
"Amazing Story, amazing acting, and amazing emotional movie.",8
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption",10
This film inspired me in so many levels and has given me hope to never give up.,10
"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.

Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.

From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.""

The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?

People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about ""redemption"" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business (its $18 million original gross didn't cover costs; it took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar nominations, including best picture).

There wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a ""prison drama"" and women don't like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Clearly this was a movie that needed word-of-mouth to find an audience, and indeed business was slowly but steadily growing when it was yanked from theaters. If it had been left to find its way, it might have continued to build and run for months, but that's not what happened.

Instead, in one of the most remarkable stories in home video history, it found its real mass audience on tapes and discs, and through TV screenings. Within five years, ""Shawshank"" was a phenomenon, a video best seller and renter that its admirers feel they've discovered for themselves. When the Wall Street Journal ran an article about the ""Shawshank"" groundswell in April 1999, it was occupying first place in the Internet Movie Database worldwide vote of the 250 best films; it's usually in the top five.

Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value ""Shawshank"" so fervently. Maybe it plays more like a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their baseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are seen objectively, not exploited.

The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space.

The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it's about to listen to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions. In the third, he rejects the whole notion of rehabilitation, and somehow in doing so he sets his spirit free, and the board releases him. Advertisement

There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red's mind.

Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman's narration. There's a feeling in Hollywood that audiences have short attention spans and must be assaulted with fresh novelties. I think such movies are slower to sit through than a film like ""Shawshank,"" which absorbs us and takes away the awareness that we are watching a film.

Deliberate, too, is the dialogue. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro."" (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's epiphanies.) Because he does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings, he becomes more fascinating: It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know.

Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the crime.

Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. ""When they put you in that cell,"" Red says, ""when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits.",4
Best film I have been came across till date what a concept what suspense Not only films subject but it's emotional balance is also way deel,9
This movie needs to be watched by every person in the world... it's worth 200% the best movie i have ever experienced....,10
"Wow, what a film. Initially got told about this film for so long and brushed it off as 'overrated'

It comes on TV from time to time and thought why not give it a watch, I'm so glad I did.

Would definitely recommend!",10
This Never Ages.handsdown the best movie I ever seen!,9
"It is amazing movie but But it is not the best movie in my opinion. It disappointed me. I understand because ending is like a ""prison break""so the movie didn't impress me.",10
"I can see from the bulk of the reviews on this page that I don't have to write a glowing review of this film...but I want to. Having read most of Steven Kings work I cant tell you how many times I have been let down by films made from his writing. In my opinion however this film surpasses his story so much so that it becomes the best film ever made. Morgan Freeman's narration of the film gives me goose bumps,the story just grabs hold and will not let you go. This film is long but I guarantee when you reach the end you will wish it would just keep going. The DVD is lacking in special features which is a shame because I'm sure I would have watched those countless times as well. All in all I say not only should everyone see this movie (rent it now!!!) but own it as I do.",9
Such an amazing movie has got to be the best by far its just so great its amazing for anyone to see i swear.,10
Good movie classy cinema less effects good lookin actors,10
Awesome movie. Such tempting. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth nd Shawshank Redemption.,10
Great film to watch! Love the film and the soundtracks!!! Great job!,10
"One of the best movie i have ever seen, i have watched this movies recently though i dont know before about this movie, then im found it on imdb top #1 movie, then i have make a decition that i will watch this movie as soon as possible, then finally i have watched this movie. And im shocked at the end, this movie was damn, the thrilling of this movie was just amazing, but maybe while you will watching this movie the story goes little bit slow, but you will find every single connection of this movies at the end. And im damn sure that your mind will blowing up at the end of this movie, The Shawshank Redemption, one of the best movies i have ever seen in hollywood, and whoever reading this review if you havent watch this movie you should watch it as soon as possible. Thank you for reading this review...",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most well written, played and directed movies of all time. Incredibly humane and realistic, it will keep the viewers interest at top throughout the whole movie without making him tired, will travel him in the same journey with the actors and leave him after the end with a sweet taste in his heart and his mind. ""Fear can set you prisoner, Hope can set you free"" claims the movie and you will really believe it. This is only one of the many massages the movie is sending. The story is so real that is breathtaking. The acting is excellent from all the actors, even in secondary roles. It is a movie that I enjoy to watch at any time, touching me each time. It is really a classic masterpiece!",8
"Story was fantastic.

Acting and the fear of actors were great, had the best storytelling and directing.",10
"There are some movies which you like because they are made on the topics you like, field you are in or hobbies which you enjoy the most. But The Shawshank Redemption is certainly not based on your life story yet it will make you to live and love every single moments of it. Just remember, Hope is a good thing in fact the best of all the things and no good things ever dies :)",10
"It is certainly the best prison movie. It's definitely the best outing for Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It's certainly the best movie of the 90's.

If you haven't seen it - buy it for your collection today!",10
What can i say...all these reviews speak for themselves...,10
"A sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word",10
The Shawshank Redemption is very thrilling and entertaining and jail based movie. Shawshank is a fictional jail in England and the movie lead manages to take himself out from that jail just by a small hammer and his wisdom.,10
"I must say that I was I little surprised to see the euphoric comments that other users have bestowed on The Shawshank Redemption. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I would not place it with the cinematic greats. It has an excellent storyline that both surprises and ultimately satisfies, and is well acted. However, there is little flair in its direction and some of its characters are a little cliched. To sum up, the Shawshank Redemption is an enjoyable film with some well thought out twists to the tale, but the 2nd best film of all time? I don't think so.",10
"It's the best movie without question but I couldn't tell anyone why it is. Does he have the best action? No, is he the best thriller? No, is it the best drama? No, no. It's the best movie. It's so simple but so good.",10
"In short, this movie is the life and hope that anyone needs to rise",10
What a great movie. Just amazing. The characters are the best.,9
"What's not to love? Action, romance, drama, it has it all!",10
The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat and is arguably one of the best movies of all time. The way the story flows in a quick and coherent manner definitely contributes to it being interesting and upbeat from the beginning to the end. It is one of those rare movies where you experience no boredom. It is an entire 20 year long journey fit into this movie in such a great way. This movie starts greatly and ends greatly.,10
"Very good movie, it give a message. I like the plot.",10
"A great movie about both good and horrible people

Who can say they watched this and did not become immersed? Everything about this movie is askew, as it gives enormous insight into our lives, the system and negative reinforcement. There are some wonderfully cathartic moments, as well in this surreal story about a man betrayed by a skank of a wife and a system that rewards profit and power over the truth. Yet, he knows much, and what he knows has been fed diligently to the same powers that oppresses them. With a very carefully thought out plot that takes the time to flesh out each character, and actors equal to the task, The pigs are disgusting and the bible thumping freak such a menace. I would hope this incredibly original film is watched by even more people.",8
"The film is satisfying but cloying. Andy is the minister of the healing power of hope. He educates the inmates on the healing power of Mozart. He builds a library. He asks Red why he stopped playing the harmonica. When Red replies that it's no use in prison, Andy looks at him soulfully and replies that ""here's where you need it the most."" Despite the somewhat unbelievable friendship between a white, upper-class banker and an African-American man in 1949, it's a valuable lesson that may seem inspired to kids who haven't heard this story before.",10
The hero is going to die and yes he killed his wife and it's a great movie amazing twist at last .,10
"There are so many movies inspire you out there, but the Shawshank Redemption is exceptionally exceptional. I wonder what make this movie exceptionally exceptional. A man with no aggression and commitments to life is behind the bar, he obeys the orders without saying a world, he won the trust of the administration and do everything silently.",10
Amazing movie! I have watched it 10 times and it will always be my number one.,10
I never saw a film like this in my life. The film was also have a strong message.,10
"Won't say to much about this movie, it's a good one. It has an interesting theme (but not new or reinterpreted), a nice effort in describing the characters and their transformation, yes. Some bits of good soundtrack, yes. and OK climax and overall an entertaining feature-film, yes.

But how in a million years can be this the greatest MOVIE of all time? Please

Please",10
I watched this movie with my friend. We both didn't have any plan for this. But we got to know from IMDB so made plan. Once we started to watch we couldn't even blink our eyes. This became one of my best movie ever. I really recommend to everyone to watch this movie.,10
"I really love this movie, I think this is the best I've ever seen, love the way it makes me think and to value my freedom. it's sad but also reminds me of a saying, if live gives you lemons you do lemonade.",10
This movie is amazing a pure masterpiece Hollywood movie,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a popular movie directed and written by the famous director Frank Darabont. The actors in this movie are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. And the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for killing his wife and her lover. The story is amazing and a must watch for all.",10
"This is an example of extremely fantastic movie, from start it made me sit by the edge of the seat and as the movie proceeds , it was just getting more and more awesome.",10
One of movie that be my favorite but not the best one,8
"The world has turn against you. You've been backed into a corner. Despite, whether you actually committed your murderous intent or not you've been ostracized from society & thrown into prison. Shawshank Redemption is a movie where characters are faced with accepting the cards they're dealt or fight for a better tomorrow knowing it's unlikely due to their past choices. You will explore the meaning of determination, strength, patience & hope.",10
I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talk.,10
"No words , can not explain how that movie affected me . Changed my perspective about cinema.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an unforgettable movie experience that left me speechless. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by the story of Andy Dufresne and his journey through the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Tim Robbins delivers a standout performance as Andy, a man who refuses to let his circumstances define him. Meanwhile, Morgan Freeman is equally phenomenal as Red, the wise and witty narrator who serves as a source of inspiration for Andy and the audience.

The film's themes of hope, friendship, and determination are woven seamlessly into the story, creating an emotional rollercoaster that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Frank Darabont's direction is impeccable, bringing the characters and their struggles to life in a way that is both raw and real.

The cinematography and score are also top-notch, adding to the film's overall impact. The stunning shots of Shawshank and the surrounding countryside are a true work of art, while the score effectively sets the mood and amplifies the emotional intensity of each scene.

In conclusion, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a must-watch movie that will leave you inspired, moved, and grateful for the gift of cinema. It's a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll and will leave a lasting impact on your life. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves films that are both thought-provoking and emotionally charged.",9
"Rarely do movies come along that change a persons perspective on life, but for The Shawshank Redemption this statement is granted. From start to finish a beautiful adaptation of what movies are supposed to be like, displaying humanities most important elements, hope, joy, retribution and redemption, they all come into play and thats what makes it a cut above the rest. Society changes views on certain aspects of life but somehow hope always stays at the forefront, for change, for a better life. To change ones situation and to free the soul of a prison of emotion. Shawshank doesn't have special effects or big blockbuster openings and endings, but it does have one thing that is more deep and special, it has a message that appeals to the good in everyone, that no ones situation is indefinite and that where there's hope, there's life.",10
"Great film u watch this when I was kid

This is lit!!!",10
Favorite movie of all time. Would highly recommend for anyone to watch,10
"My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.

A lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the actors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificent.

I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.

I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.

This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.

So see it, buy it, love it.",8
"My absolute favorite movie. The plot, the acting, the music and the camera work.

Together make an almost perfect film for me.

A film that gets by without cgi action bombast like many of today's flicks and still deserves to be #1 on Imdb.",10
"Why did I rewatch this movie? I asked myself. Sometimes i want to remember the same felling as i watched this for the first time. Iam not a guy who watches the same movie twice or more but when it comes to Shawshank Redemtion i couldn't stop myself. I am truly moved by this movie's beauty. There aren't many movies like Shawshank Redemtion. Don't lose your hope, as Andy said""Get busy living or get busy dying.""",10
"The best movie I've ever seen. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film made for midnight showings. It's ominous, brutal, pretentious, and often stirring. Even though some sections feel rushed and it falls apart at the end, every part of it is memorable. Set mostly in gloomy fairy-tale woodlands, where representatives of science are terrorized by forces both human and uncanny, this is a low-budget thriller that carries itself with the swagger of a larger production.",10
The casting of the movie must be realistic. It is an important element of review writing to tell the readers how the content of the film fits into your course. Is the movie distorting the historical facts?,10
"The main character of the film, I think that after watching, everyone fell in love. First of all, an excellent actor, not everyone can play such a brilliant role so brilliantly. To convince the audience of your image so much is simply superb! The image itself is amazing, I don't know whether I fell in love with an actor or with a hero !? Hide behind all your talents, with a smile, such a secret, and without telling (only then with guesswork and ingenuity) even your only friend in prison - get out! Hope is the main thing for every person. And also to remain human everywhere, even in prison.",10
"This movie is outstanding, a brilliant art and certainly one of its kind. No doubt why 27 years have passed and still it is everywhere, infact ruling IMDb too. Hats off to everyone part of this masterpiece esp. The director, cast and writer.",10
:3 THIS WAS VERY AMAZING!!!! I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH THIS AGAIN.,9
"Very good.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.",10
I liked the film from the bottom of my heart. Absolute masterpiece.,9
"This is the film that seems to make people excited that they can tell other film-lovers that they like, because it seems sophisticated. With it's captivating title and the feel-good story of friendship, it's about as complicated as most American movie-goers can get. This can be a decent one to keep on, if you switch to it on TV and have some laundry to fold. However, there are hundreds of films I'd rather watch to stimulate my mind. I would have said thousands but I've only seen slightly over a thousand films so far. I know that many people have a special place for this film in their heart, but they never really seem to stop and ask themselves ""why?"". Shawshank does have a few, fun gotcha-type moments, and the shot of Andy in the stream after escape is quite memorable. However, the film itself is not one of those birds whose feathers are too bright that ""are not meant to be caged."" This film needs to stay shelved when we are discussing the greats. It can find itself comfortably and appropriately filed between Shallow Hal and Shiloh.",10
"When you watch this movie,direction is so good you will feel yourself in jail and even that if you go outside you're gonna miss the jail...........but the suspense they open in the last i'm 100% sure you're not regret it i would give it a 11 out of 10 if they'd give me a way.............",8
"Shawshank Redemption is a great film. This is one of the best dramas ever made, and probably Morgan Freeman's best film. One of the reasons why it was so good is the voice-over in the film. Morgan Freeman has a superb reading voice and works well as a narrator. I think the best scene is when Andy plays the opera music and all the prisoners look up to the speakers as if it is a God or idol. It shows a glimpse of freedom in the eyes of the prisoners. Also the story-line was excellent, but I dont think that it was explained clear enough what happened in the beginning. But it still is one of the best films made.",9
"One of the best classic movies out there.

Wouldn't say its a hundred times rewatch, but definitely worth the hype!",10
"Patience,Hope, Determination and hard work ,the key of success Must watch movie once in a lifetime Strong message and life changing.... Do watch.",10
"I must have seen this movie over twenty times, and every time i watch it feels like the first time i'm watching it. words escape me in describing how good this movie is, and i dare say that ""The Godfather"" became second on my list because of it. Simply Amazing, simply invigorating, simply a masterpiece. If the 20th century's best piece of art was to be searched for, then search no more. This is the definitive piece of art that movie makers should look up to. The minimum length for a comment is 10 lines, but what more can i put down to describe such a movie. i own four copies of this movie 2 regular edition DVDs and 2 Special Editions. do i need to say more. Do yourself a favor and acquire a copy, you'll be glad you did.",9
Fantastic film. Such enticing. It is a Stephen King adaptation of the novellas Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption.,10
"I feel like people ranked this movie so high just because it was the thing to do. The movie was overall just ""okay"" if you really look at it and pick it apart.",10
Isn't obvious that you definitely should watch this one?,10
Best movie i have ever seen. Made me rethink some parts of my own life.,9
"Based on a novella by Stephen King, it was critically acclaimed upon release, but bizarrely won no Academy Awards, despite being nominated in seven categories.

They'll just have to satisfy themselves with the equally prestigious recognition of being voted the best film of all time by LADbible readers.

As for the other films in the running, they were chosen because of their high-rating on film encyclopedia website IMDb.

Currently, Christopher Nolan's second Batman film holds a rating of 9.0 on the website, as does The Godfather Part II.

The Godfather starring Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan - among others - has a rating of 9.1, whereas The Shawshank Redemption rates at 9.2.

All of the films in the running were stone cold classics, but when everything is eventually boiled down, The Shawshank Redemption has it all.

Well, apart from Kermit the Frog and Tim Curry, anyway.",8
I am stunned after watching this . This is a proper life witnesss movie . I fell in love with morgan freeemans acting here . This film is lenghty but its full of entertainment and joy .,10
"A masterclass in pretty much every category. An incredible script, wonderful direction, gorgeous score and phenomenal performances by Freeman and Robbins. Cinema doesn't get any better than this.",10
"""This is no fairy tale""
Red (Morgan Freeman)


No matter if you watch this movie in the 2000s or In the year 2040.

This movie is always going to leave you with satisfaction and completeness.

The narration, acting, storyline, screenplay are thought and executed to all most perfection.

A story about an escape that narrates life as it is inside those walls.",10
"Until past few year this movie still now top rating in imdb. I seen this movie when i live with my parents, story are so impressive .",10
Its really a good movie but this movie don't deserve the firs and best movie ever.,10
"This is one of the few titles I wish everyone had in his library. It's a film to be watched again and again. It's a timeless masterpiece.

The Shawshank Redemption has the power to first make you look inward and then uplift you more than any other film. It's meta score should be 100. Shame to those self declared critics.",10
Best Movie Ever. Must Watch. Slow In The Starting But It Changes All.,7
This Movie Started Slow But Then Little Twist Change All . Must Watch Movie.,10
GUYS I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE AND YES! I WILL WATCH IT!,10
This is my favourite movie ever infinty even more than the room.,10
"There's 2 kinds of people who watch this film - this who get it and those who don't.

Of the latter category, yeah OK, it is just a film about a couple of guys in prison. It's excellently acted, scripted, directed and filmed. And yeah it does have a great ending.

But there's something more than that. And this is where former category of people come in.

The film is about hope, and living with hope. ""Andy Dufrenes"" (Tim Robbins) is imprisoned wrongly. Where many people would have given up, he refuses to do so and throughout his time in prison, clings to that hope. A journey of 1000 miles is taken one step at a time.

Contrast this to ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman). He's become used to being in prison, he's institutionalised, his repeated parole refusals have meant he's give up hope. And like Brooks before him he knows that he wouldn't survive on the outside.

""Get busy living, or get busy dying"", says Andy. It's the hope that Andy has carried throughout that provides the salvation, the redemption, for both himself and Red.

I can't recommend this movie highly enough.",10
"Hope is a good thing,may be the best of things, And no good thing ever dies....💓💓",10
It is the best movie I have ever seen no cap better than all movies it is the best movie I have ever seen no cap better than all movies.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption, based on a Stephen King novel, was directed by Frank Darabont.

It's challenging to adapt a book to the big screen (especially if it is a popular book). Due to Mr. Darabont's work, the movie not only respects its source material but also stands on its own.

Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red (a great example of adding or differentiating an essential part of the original material) makes it new and more effective.

Red's friendship with the protagonist Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) adds more layers to the story.

Andy's Journey keeps the viewer engaged for the entire length of the film.

Having a flawed and complex protagonist made the story more compelling, and having not two heartless villains alongside The Sisters, gave the audience more reasons to root for Andy.

Also, shout out to Brooks he has the most heart wrenching character arc in the entire film.

Overall a must-see movie that will give us hope and teach us not to give up on anything in life.",10
Best friendship movie in the world and jail life explain is perfect. That movie watch night time then better experience. My rating in the movie is 10/10. Defenatly must watch movie in your life. Most motivation content in this movie.,10
Good an awsome move watch it it is a best movie ever.,10
Shawshank Redemption is worth watching at any time. If you haven't watched it yet then you have missed one of the greatest movies. The best thing about it is that you will love the pace at which the movie will forge ahead and there will be a glimpse of a smile at many scenes on your face.,10
"Story, action every thing of this movie i enjoy to watch.",10
Speechless with this film. What a performance by all that actors in this film.,10
"There are just no words to describe just how cleverly put together the script is. The actors are at there very best. Freeman and Robins have a chemistry that is unique to find these days. It can only be described as a classic.

The directing is on point and the cinematography.

In the day of DVD, this would have been a must as part of a collection.

I would struggle to rate a movie higher than this. In a movie void of CGI, the film relies just on story and superb old school acting.

You will want to watch this movie again and again as the years go on.",10
this movie was awesome you guys should check it out. i seen this movie so many times. i believe you guys will love it. i really think you guys should watch it. its very interesting so guys if you believe me check it out.. its worth the time watching.. its very popular and i think you will like it too. hop you guys check it out its great an that's a promise so guys please check it out its an really good movie and while you are reading this check out a even better movie the intruder its also a fantastic movie everyone should watch..please guys check it out its great just like this movie its very great i promise its a time killer,10
"As I mentioned in the title, the main reason of popularity of this movie is to address all ages.

When I was a child watching Shawshank with my parents I could understand the messages as well as today. Such a masterpiece!",10
"I saw the Shawshank Redemption with my parents when it first came out in 1994. I remember being sucked into a story that I could not stop watching. I do not want to give any spoilers, so being as vague as possible... as the story unfolds you start to wonder how the story could possibly end for Andy, and then when the crucial scene comes... wow. This movie has quite probably the best ending in movie history. An ending that has been built all the way throughout the entire movie without you even noticing. I have always thought this was the best movie ever made. When I discovered the IMDb website I was very excited to see that many people must agree with me. If you haven't already noticed, it has been given a 9.2 rating which is the #1 highest movie rating of all time.",10
"Everything about this movie is excellent. The plot, the acting, the suspense, the ""realism"", so much more. Love it.",1
Everyone deserves a Oscar for the way each actor has acted in the film.,10
"The cast is superb. A real chemistry seems to bond Robbins, Freeman, and their inner circle. Will Sadler, the stone-faced bad guy in Die Hard 2, steals several scenes as the country-loving Heywood, and Vancouver native Gil Bellows shines as Tommy, the cocky high-school drop-out whose fate is pretty much sealed once we're told he has a wife and baby son waiting for him outside the prison walls. Brown, with his hair trimmed so neatly he's this close to being a dead ringer for Al Gore, displays an obsessive brutality that his Highlander role never hinted at. Freeman delivers a subtle but potent performance, letting just the teeniest dabs of despair leak through the cracks of his easy- going facade. Robbins brings the perfect mixture of fresh-faced bewilderment and canny deceit to his role as Dufresne, handling the dramatic and comic elements with equal ease. Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they more than make up for the script's deficiencies.",10
"This movie is in my top 10 best movies of all time. The storyline is simple and because of that, this film is easy to recommend. The acting, the characters, the beginning, and the end are all perfect. It is one of those movies that are beautiful as they are, they don't need sequels.

Even though the story is simple it is still timeless with classical motives of friendship, belief, and of justice.

I think everybody should watch it even once because it is entertaining, motivating, and especially satisfying. It all clicks at the end and leaves you fulfilled.

Some day this movie will be considered one of the most essential classical movies of all time!",10
"This movie takes you like a storm, starting of easy, but as the movie moves along you get pulled back in your seat just enjoying the fine acting, and story..

Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins does some of the best acting i've ever seen...

THIS IS A MUST SEE!!",10

"The Shawshank redemption "" is based upon legendary stephen king's novel which represents very truth of life never lose hope because it probably best of all . Great direction by frank darabondt , impeccable script , screenplay , towering performances by cast made this movie greatest movie ever made . Duffrian's relentless effort to get away from prison life stands him alone from others , life in prison is totally different one just have to confront his /her fear trauma , one has to tackle with them else life will be nothing less than hell , also keep your mind busy as mind itself can be most troubled thing in prison life if it remained unattended . Casting is another great thing about this movie , characters of Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman have been crafted by director so perfectly that they have become great source of inspiration for all.",10
"I'm not an English major so take this as it goes -

I'm gonna try and make this quick. My favorite movie of all time is T2 and Jaws...but this film...man if I had to pick one...JUST ONE...this would be it. Sure its based off a book but goddamn is it amazing. The acting, the set design, the cinematography...EVERYTHING...literally...NOTHING is wrong with this film. The Score, the story, the pace...EVERYTHING. After my house fire I had two years ago I felt like Andy...everything taken away from him...nothing but himself and what was inside (a reference to him and Mozart remember?) ....as time went on I learned that its not the physical items in your life but what you have inside. Even though I had seen the film more times than most...a few days after the fire...and a few days of drinking and self pity(rightfully so) I was inside my hotel room and said screw it and watched the flick. Get busy livin...or get busy dying......THATS GOD DAMN RIGHT! I owe a lot to this film both before and especially after the fire. If you don't think of it as AT LEAST one of the top 5 movies of all time...you better have one good damn reason. R Smith Cape Cod, MA wink emoticon",10

"""Hope is a good thing probably best of all & good thing never dies ."" This line from this movie shows the actual truth of what humans need most. "" The Shawshank Redemption "" is based upon the legendary Stephen king's novel, which represents the very truth of life never lose hope because it is probably best of all. Excellent direction by frank Darabont, impeccable script, screenplay, towering performances by a cast made this movie the most deserving film ever made. Casting is another great thing about this movie. The characters of Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman have been crafted by the director so ideally that they have become a great source of inspiration for all. I believe this movie is a life learning lesson, and everyone must need to watch this movie and understand how difficult, traumatic life can be. One of the scenes where one of the inmates committed suicide when he was released from prison and allowed to live every day was tough for him to adjust to society like he has become accustomed to prison life. That harsh reality will shock you at how traumatic it is life could be. This great movie is absolutely an everything gem of world cinema. Don't miss this great movie. It's a lifetime experience of a kind you won't ever forget.",10
"The Shashank Redemption is a very good movie that is highly rated on many popular movie rating websites.

What I learned from the movie: 1. Plan everything, be good at planning everything so you can escape a bad and secured castle prison easier.

2. Use tricks, be extremely smart, get power in the prison by your super smart brain and powerful mind to gain the trust of the boss, the police guards that have weapons, and the prisoners that might be innocent in the prison.

3. Do not be found by anyone until you escaped, make sure you are safe and secure and no one can find you.

4. Do not ever give up, so you do become a good and more powerful guy, then you can live the rest of your life peacefully with a good house.

5. Bad guys are bad because they start doing bad things, though sometimes they succeed. Then they do more bad things until they failed, then they got caught by police, and be in jail.

6. Everything is possible, and the people that think not everything is possible are a problem for the people that think everything is possible, and it might causes arguments.",10
Brilliant movie with unexpected twists and turns. Best acting from all the cast. Just awesome work from the entire crew. There are a lot of nail biting and edge of the seat moments. A must watch movie.,10
This movie is not like other movie you haver ever seen. The message and the way it is build is perfect.,10
"I can't say anything that'll do this movie justice, just go and watch it, you won't regret it.",10
"This movie shows a great friendship between main characters Red and Andy. People should strive to gain an understanding and have immense respect for one another. Andy gave hope to Red throughout their friendship. I learned there is a right moment for everything, because Andy planned to escape from the prison when no one had any idea. When the warden was caught saving that money, by filing false claims, he ended up killing himself. This shows that justice seeks to find itself in the end. This movie was shocking, because no one would have thought about how Andy planned his escape. However, if you watched the movie closely you could see hints about how Andy was strategic on his every move,like a chess game is played out.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption, release in 1994, was released to critical acclaim and box-office success. Morgan Freeman ever won the oscar. I too love this movie. I will take the DVD of this film to my grave.",10
"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.

Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch)",10
I like this film so much! I don't believe that somebody can make a great film. That is amazing idea and insprise. I will introduce that with my friends.,10
"watch it twice, thrice or how many ever times, the shawshank redemption is one movie that you can never call boring, especially for the way it has dealed with abstract terms like humanity and hope. the movie does have its flaws such as Red being the only guy who's hair has greyed after 33 yrs in prison. but then, when you watch such a great movie, these flaws are easily to be forgotten.what is to be remembered is the victory of the human spirit.",10
"Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.",8
"What an amazing emotional film. Performances are all top notch, and the story is so moving. Tim Robbins as the quiet and introverted Andy gives us a look at performances to come, and Morgan Freeman proves as always he can be counted on to give an authoritative performance. While the name ""Stephen King"" attached to a film might suggest something in the horror genre, this simple tale of men in prison is so much more. The sublime moments, while small move so much. And the character Brooks deserves special mention too, simply moving. Frank Darabont has created something with this film, and it will stand as one of (if not THE) greatest films ever made for quite some time.",9
"It took me 23 years to watch this movie. 23 whole years, and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The simplicity, the story line, everything just amazing. I have read plenty of reviews and many people suggested that I see this move and I have actually owned it for a number of years but never took the time to watch it. I then read a book called 1001 movies you must see before you die and of course, this was one of the movies. I decided to make a list and start making movies off. I am so glad I did but this is a jewel that I would have never taken the time to watch.",8
"Honestly, for me the movie is almost a 10/10 and I never consider anything perfect.

Didn't feel the time passing at all, more like 10 minutes!

It is an incredibly great movie - the way the prison is presented truly made you feel like you're mesmerized.

So the director never made anything else really? Intrigue on top of quality., The plot. The script. The storytelling. The cinematography. The acting. The music. Everything.

One to re-watch again. And then again.",10
"An incredible script, wonderful direction, gorgeous score and phenomenal performances by Freeman and Robbins. Cinema doesn't get any better than this. 🙌",10
"is the best movie ever made i love it This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie ranked in my top 5 list. The movie is based in a prison, where violence, sexual references and profanity are part of the daily life. The story line is excellent with great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman especially. I have watched this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it every time I see it just as much as the first time.",10
"This is the best film ever that has done. So if u havent watch this u should. I dont need to write more then that becouse whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated becouse this is one off the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everthing you could possibly want",10
This movie kept me completely engulfed in the movie and it's characters. It is well written and the acting is top notch. I watch this movie once or twice every couple years and it's like watching for the first time everytime.,10
"Andy Dufresne has been at Shawshank for 19 years. He spent 19 years of his life in captivity for a murder he did not commit. During this time, he especially told Red and the people around him not to lose hope by turning on small lights in such bad conditions. It's time for Andy to get rid of Shawshank. In his last conversation with Red, he tells her that he has to choose between living fast and dying fast.

Andy makes a will-like request to Red. If he goes out, he says that there is something very important belonging to him under the volcanic glass, a stone that is not of this world and buried under an oak tree in the place he describes. This is one last piece of advice that will keep Red's hopes up.",10
"It was given by a friend as a marriage gift, I loved this movie right away. everything is soo perfect, the music, the narration, the end. When I feel down here is the dvd.... and I am perfectly in a good mood. I really thank my friend for giving me this movie.",10
"Simply marvelous entertainment.

A tough, complex story with clarity, compassion and considerable dramatic force. An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time.",9
as with many others i first saw this film on video and after watching it i was stunned by what is a very simple story told in such a way that at the end of the film i knew i had watched a cinematic masterpiece. the performances of robbins and freeman are excellent but i believe all the cast make this film what it is. a modern classic,6
"One of the best films that give hope in a place surrounded by despair and corruption. The performance of the actors was more than wonderful, and the plot of the film is more than excellent, and it is enough that it is the strongest rating so far.",1
"A person can did anything, nothing is impossible, for him. The movies learn us to keeps faith in God and makes your path with full of positive vibes and attitude.

Really nice movie.

Once you must watch this.",10
"Writing, acting, location, sentiment and everything else... great movie. Watch it once and then 5 more times, you will without question. PhillyG @talktalkphillyg",9
"If I feel low for any kind of reasons, I just sit and watch this movie. I have a list of my favorite movies. In the list there are name of the movies like the pursuit of happiness, good will hunting, into the wild etc. In the top of the list there is this name. You can say it my all time favorite movie and I can watch it any number of times irrespective of the situation. I'm no one to say which one is best movie, but I can definitely say that this movie is a masterpiece and you will feel the warmth of happiness for believing in the positive side of people. Believing in love, hope and friendship is truly an exclusive feeling and this Shawshank Redemption give me 100 times of this.",10
Best emotional and meaningful scenes i have ever seen. Must watch this film at least 3 times. It is ok to watch with childs too. You can not describe film with words. Easily 10/10.,9
"Shawshank Redemption was a splendid watch, from the detailed story telling and accuracy of the environment and human psychology we receive this masterpiece. A complete different scenery and life happens between the walls of Shawshank Prison as from the commonly known life of Andrew Dufresne a successful banker, that is what we learn after the infity of obstacles, ups and downs he encounters while serving his time on his imprisonment. EXCELLENT DIALOGUE, VERY GOOD PACING, VERY GOOD ACTING, EXCELLENT SCRIPT AND STORY.

We can appreciate the amazing work writers have accomplished by delivering this work of art and its script to us the viewers, a fantastic ending and pacing throughout the whole film that keeps us entertained and makes us understand with no additional explanation needed what every character feels and goes through. A great performance by the lead actor Tim Robbins as he displays what is to be a man who is taken everything away from him, where many men would have lost hope and will to live but not him. The most remarkable performance we can see at this novel adaptation is Morgan Freeman's as the perfect supporting actor and narrator of this story, he really demonstrated how people's actions especially close friends and even family can affect you.

This film really gave everyone of us a different perspective of life and how prison can damage you even to a point where you become dependent of it.",5
This is the greatest movie of all time. It is based on a Stephen King novella. He is the best author there is. This movie stars Morgan Freeman. One of the best actors there is. This is a highly emotional masterpiece. It draws you and and does not let go until it wants to. A great date movie. A great anything movie. See it.,10
"Truly a great movie. It has amazing casting with amazing story. I can't express how much I enjoyed it.

When I started watching it I didn't really expect high from it since it is an old movie, and it isn't the type of movies that I watch, but oh my god how wrong was I.

All the actors did their job wonderfully and made me feel all type of emotions as I was watching it. I was happy when they were happy and sad when they were sad. It made me feel as if I was one of the members of their friend group.

The story is full of meaningful messages. I watched it about 5 days ago, and I'm still thinking about it.

I recommend it to everyone and to those who have already watched it, they might as well watch it again.",10
"This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made. It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins. But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes). Very memorable, showing what movies are made of. Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie. A++",10
"It is just so well acted. You believe it all and want more of every single character!

Clever, moralistic and entertaining.

Hollywood has done very few consequential movies since (V For Vendetta, Captain Fantastic and perhaps Watchmen..) so grab this one if you have not watched it.",9
"I only just viewed this film, which my mum said would be good watch in my revision breaks. And it is! its very hooking in the sense that you cant stop once you begun, but i had to as i did an hour of revising before hand, having 30mins of viewing time. Then i gave up revising when i had enough of this stop start routine and watched it through. And i think its influential to any type of person out there, and if you have time to watch it. As its most probable my ""now"" favourite film. As i really like horrors and sci-fi's i thought i wouldn't like this. but anything that Stephen King writes or Frank Darabont directs.

I recommend this to anyone.",10
"This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories. Stephen King, who penned Stand by Me, also wrote the short story on which The Shawshank Redemption is based. Here we have all the things that made Stand by Me such a satisfying experience: lovable characters, writer flourishes, one- dimensional evil antagonists, enduring friendships, poetic justice, and a happy ending. This one is far darker and far more violent than Stand by Me and so ought to be reserved only for older teens. The story is slow to develop, and younger kids and children sensitive to the suffering of others may find this world a difficult one to sit with for the film's duration.",10
"A wonderful film with a wonderful cast. A very long climax makes you not lose sight of the plot. It was very pleasant to watch this historian, I will definitely recommend this film to my friends.",10
"The film is a breathtakingly simple story: an innocently convicted guy is imprisoned, and how he manages to live there. And it is to live, not to exist like everyone else. Especially considering that he knows that he is sentenced for a very long time.

A film that gives you the opportunity to think about a lot of things. A man like Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) can be an example of how to live and deal with all the troubles.

The entire cast is wonderful. Of course, Morgan Freeman could have been singled out, but in my opinion, none of the actors stood out from the overall picture.

I don't think anyone stood out, but I don't think any of the actors stood out. It was a movie to see.",9
I didn't think anything bad would happen because of the high score. I am very impressed. It is a production that I will watch over and over again as I remember it from time to time. Sorry for watching so late.,10
"And the final dialogue, when Red reads a letter from Andy: ""Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of all, and good things don't die."" ""I hope I can cross the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope that the Pacific Ocean is as blue as I saw it in my dreams. I hope so.""

I have seen this film countless times, but with each new viewing I watch it as if for the first time, reliving the events and rethinking life together with the characters of the picture. After watching it, I sit for a long time in thought with tears in my eyes, but at this moment there is calmness and some kind of lightness in my soul. Everyone should watch this movie, and even if you are not a movie fan, after watching ""Escape from the Shawshank"" you will gain a lot for yourself. One of the strongest and deepest dramas in the history of cinema.

10 out of 10.",10
"Something really wonderful to watch every few years while wishing that you were watching it again for the first time.

I believe several reviewers here together with critics (which I normally don't agree with) have already reviewed this movie far better than I could I'll just leaving my final thoughts on it.

Personally I really enjoyed watching Andy from start to finish with Red and the other supporting cons coming together in a really enjoyable set of tales that united them all in the horrible place that they were pushed into. Sure, they were all (mostly anyway) guilty and deserving of their new ""digs"" however watching and wondering if it really was possible to bend circumstances to make life just a little better in such a hell hole sure was entertaining.",10
"This the good moive and good graphics and good sound. The story telling is the best scene to watch and good at comedy and full fun of the good scenes. Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films and the film medium. In general, film criticism can be divided into two categories: journalistic criticism which appears regularly in newspapers,",10
It really was one of the best and most instructive films I've seen in my entire life. The theme of the film really makes people eager to pursue the film.,9
"Actually I think this movie is flawless. Intresting story_line and Characterizations,the Shawshank redemption is the best movie i have ever seen. At least it is in my top 3.",10
"In my opinion, this film shows a very good life expectancy.",9
"This movie showed me what inmates have to go through to survive in prison, and taught me to walk a straight line. I loved how it allows you to connect to the realism. People actually go though these things and some never will have the opportunity to be heard. This movie shows there are consequences for actions, it also shows how the judicial system is and it also shows love, hate, and triumph. Sometimes we're dealt a bad hand but you can overcome that, this movie gives hope to other prisoners that have been through similar situations. I loved it and this will always be a memorable movie.",10
"Not for a reason. But for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. Its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. A film who reminds more than presents. Values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in.",10
"One of the most highest rated movies on IMDB and deserves to be so. It is just phenomenal 👍🏻. Very motivating, life changing, Thriller, Suspense, Drama, exciting movies of all time. Definitely amongst my fav top 10 movies of all time 🤘🏻",10
"Amazing movie. It was really entertaining , the cast played their role really well. Morgan Freeman was really good in this movie. The plot is amazingly written and portrayed , Overall i recommend it 100% one of the greatest movies of all time.",9
"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before?

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

You never know when they'll get you. I have been ready since the day I was born to stave off a bear attack. I hope this movie educates people on the danger of bear attacks. So like the main character is the greatestted guy cuz he like talks about bear attacks but I don't like the villain cuz he talks about sharks instead of bears and I didn't like the part when they revealed to be his brother because that is a spoiler.",10
This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that.,9
"You must see this film. It´s a homage about friendship, freedom. Wonderful cast, great script. Memorable moments. An excellent chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

"""Hope is a good thing, maybe best of things, and no good thing ever dies""- Andy Dufresne, Shawshank Redemption, 1994.

This film has a special place in my heart. It starts with setting a brief premise to the overall cause of 'How our protagonist ended up in the Shawshank?', and which serves the purpose. Latter the story opens up with more characters, their perspective on life, and their course of activities which they assume are necessary to survive in Shawshank. Although Andy is the main protagonist, the movie also gives its supporting cast good opportunities, which gives the story a more mature, realistic, and solid foundation.

The story opens up layer by layer and throws you into the heart of Shawshank, where you can observe its analogies with human life brilliantly depicted by eye-soothing cinematography and exceptionally well-written screenplay. At its core, it's a story of faith and hope.

This film is a remarkably best example of setting a difference between 'Reaction and Response' to unfortunate incidents in our life. While everybody was busy reacting to these events, licking them till they bleed again, Andy was busy engraving his future in Zihuatanejo.

The narrative let you feel the experiences of the protagonist at the time of his stay in Shawshank. The enormous tragedies that lie between Andy and his salvation will astound you. Andy's selfless actions are the highlights of his journey in Shawshank, which defines pure Karma. His belief in tiny actions and unprecedented faith in hope is the backbone of the Shawshank Redemption.

The experience of a lifetime, definitely recommended watching it.",10
"WHAT. A. MOVIE This is a great film It is just so well acted. You believe it all and want more of every single character!

Clever, moralistic and entertaining.",2
Could watch it everyday for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. The shawshank redemption is a timeless classic. A simple story with such a profound message combined with the acting of tim robbins and morgan freeman makes it imo the best movie ever made.,10
"I can feel goosebumps all over my body every time i saw the movie , it's like the first time , i already now can repeat the words with the main characters, i can't believe there was anyone put any movie before that masterpiece, with respect for all opinions but the shawshank redemption is a work of art no one can doubt that . And i am thankful to keep seeing this movie until i die . For everyone in the work thank you , no one can do this art and no one can make such a masterpiece, tim robbins was super great and morgan freeman , he is like the movie itself , i can't imagine how possible can this movie doesn't take a single oscar . Such a shame.",9

"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

A movie that should be shown in every classroom. An enlightened work that could help many avoid a few curbs balls up ahead as they set out on their life and possibilities ahead. The message here is friendship and freedom and tenacity of the human spirit. Redemption is possible even in the most dire set of circumstances.,9

"this movie has it all. it has an exraordinary plot and the storyline between morgan freeman and tim robbins is one that i have never seen before. no movie has a ""buddy to buddy"" relationship as in this movie. this movie made me cry at the end, although to be honest, it was kidna predictable how he would redeem himself. the ending was also predictiable, but still, why does a movie not have to be predictable to be great? being predicatble makes the viewer happy that the movie is headed in a happy direction.",10
If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment.,10

"I cannot believe this movie came out in 1994 and I just saw it for the first time today. I have been missing out! This is my new favorite movie of all time. If you haven't seen this movie yet,you MUST see it. It's Morgan Freeman's best work ever and he should have gotten an oscar for it. I have never liked Tim Robbins,but his performance deserved an oscar also.",10
"Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.

The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.",10
Everyone should watch and add this excellent movie to their favorite playlist. Everything is amazing about this amazing from story line to the ending. It is so great to see this type of amazing picturisation and screenplay during that time. It is still recommended to watch it now in the year 2022.,10
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There is no need to comment on this. I would suggest everyone. It is a kind of movie that is made for every audience.,9

"Orget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.",10

It was a perfect movie I ever seen. I really didn't expect that I had a sort of ironic feeling between good and bad. it keeps me reconsider about what is good and what is bad. I couldn't tell the answer because it made up like that. what a nice movie.,9

"One of the best dramas of all time!

This film is not your typical Hollywood production. It carries a powerful and profound message. This film's basis, which is hope, served as a solid base upon which to build.

In addition to the film's message, the performance was outstanding. One of the best performances ever was delivered by Tim Robbins. He was positive, knowledgeable, and most importantly, motivating. I was merely amused by his performance. The character Andy Dufresne, played by Robbins, was falsely imprisoned for the murders of his wife and her lover. Even if he receives life sentences, he never gives up. He befriends Morgan Freeman's character Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding in the movie. In contrast to Robbins, Freeman, who delivers the best performance of his career, has given up.",7
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.

Darabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce The Shawshank Redemption, which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, principal photography took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio, with the Ohio State Reformatory serving as the eponymous penitentiary.

"Shawshank joins Misery and Stand By Me as the best adaptations up until now.

This is simply one of the best films ever made, and I know I'm not the first or the last to say that. This can be measured by the IMDb ranking. According to this date, it is ranked #3, but I'm sure it could rise to the top. As a result, I will skip the usual praise for the film since we all know how great it is. My fascination with Shawshank lies in the fact that it was written by Stephen King.

There is no doubt that King is one of the world's best writers. Some of the greatest stories ever told have been found in books such as IT and the Castle Rock series. Nevertheless, the best directors are always responsible for his best adaptations. Kubrick interpreted The Shining beautifully, and Rob Reiner directed Misery and Stand By Me as well. As a result, Frank Darabont made one of the best King films ever made. King's message is clearly understood by him, and he conveys it beautifully through his writing.

Among the best films ever made, this one demonstrates a powerful message. Hope is eternal in it. Despite not committing a crime, Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne is sent to prison for one. Despite this, he never gives up hope. No matter how hard he tries, he never gives up on his quest for freedom. With years of tenacity, patience, and wit, he has not only kept himself sane, but he has given his mind and spirit a will to live. The film has a unique feel. This is the first time I've seen anything like it, and I don't know if it will ever be repeated.",8

The film portrays how Andy Defresne, uses his banking knowledge to gain ""freedom"" from predatory inmates and the officers in charge of the prison. In the passage of time, he becomes hopeful and influential within the prison. This made him gain the respect of his co-inmates, especially longtime convict ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) who became his closest ally. Andy eventually, achieves freedom by escaping.",10
"This is one of the best pictures ever made. The acting, directing, screenplay...are so wonderful! But, for the Academy, the best picture of 1994 was...Forrest Gump (!!!!!!!!!!!!).

I enjoyed this movie a lot. I do not wish to spoil it so I will leave you with that much!,10
"Given how gorgeous the movie is, it is not surprising that it receives such a high rating. What can I add that hasn't already been said?

Unlike other movies that you watch and then forget about days later, this movie sticks with you after you've watched it.

The ultimate tale of friendship, optimism, and perseverance in the face of difficulty.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.",10

"I saw this movie yesterday again. First time I saw it I was 13, and I had already loved it. The pleasure and sensations felt while watching this picture are difficult to describe. It had been a long time since I had last felt this way about a movie. I was completely submersed in the plot, all my mind concentrated in the facts of the movie. One loses connection with reality and, for some time, one's life disappears and the movie becomes one's life. This is the sign that indicates us that we are in presence of a great masterpiece. The plot is a beautiful story about hope, freedom and friendship. The cast couldn't be better: both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman (one of the greatest actors of all time, when are they going to give him an Oscar?) are superb in the leading roles. Supporting cast is great too, especially veteran James Whitmore. Thomas Newton composed the music, which perfectly supports the scenes in an extremely subtle, but at the same time incredibly effective way. It brings sensibility to the images without using sentimental tricks. And this is one of the great qualities of the movie: it's moving and evocative, without ever being sentimental. Sentimental music could have ruined the movie, but Thomas Newman made a great job. The director of photography is Roger Deakins, who has already astonished us with the amazing black and white photography of ""The man who wasn't there"". A masterpiece.",10
"This gem of a movie The Shawshank Redemption, ironically, was snubbed during its time (1994)---both critically and commercially. In recent years, however, there's a growing legion of cineastes singling out this film as the best, if not, one of the best of all time.

This movie is the perfect example of a masterpiece way ahead of its time. Take it as Beethoven's Symphony #5 of cinema. Years go by and the echo of its message gets louder and becomes even more relevant. It's about how we are defined by the establishment's greed and corruption.

It's about how we have forgotten our humanity.

It's about why our possessions, especially money, continue to deny us of the ever-elusive happiness we all yearn for.

It's about our capability to love our fellowmen under any circumstances.

Most importantly, it's about life as a matter of choice and how we can outdo the fear that imprisons us in misery. If only we tap our power from within. As its main message suggests, ""Fear can hold us prisoner. Hope can set us free.""

The Shawshank Redemption is a must for those undergoing severe depression. It keeps us glued to our seats while all of its elements seem to magnify the message of hope, love AND yes...redemption.

With a budget of $25 million, it earned only $58 million. It had 7 Oscar nominations but won nothing. NADA.

It is underrated and over qualified.

However, it has been #1 on IMDb's user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed The Godfather. In my opinion, this is the best movie of all time. Morgan Freeman must be honoured with the best performance of all time.

My criteria: unlike The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption does not only grip the viewer's heart. It zaps the audience to boldly declare: LIFE IS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL!

Don't ever blame me if you fail to see this movie after this post. I warned you.",10

"What makes this film universal and timeless is not its cinematic mastery to adress nostalgia, or its perfect performances by the leads, but the afterwards sensastion that linger for life.

This sensation comes from my interpreation of one of the meanings of the film, that is that we all indeed owe to others but never at the expense of not owing to ourselves the freedom of choice. Beyond that, one should always be free to decide if, and when, give up hope or renounce to life. And everyone should work for a world where choices are available.

Andy Dufresne's conviction -judicial- is by no means equal to giving up the conviction -hope- of his own identity and freedom.",10
"It's one of the best films you will ever see.

Morgan Freeman's narration is always a classy move for a film. Everyone is convincing in their roles.

Clancy Brown is great as the guard..what a b#@#%&<!

Morgan is Great. Period.

Billy Sadler, Bob Gunton.. a lot of actors you should recognise.

Tim Robbins is convincing as the lead.

It is one of the best Stephen King adaptations. So many have been cringy, but this is spot on. If it had been in the oscars that year, it would have swept the board but I vaguely remember some reason it wasn't.

Only scene that feels slightly off is at the end with Gunton in Andys cell and the manner that he makes the discovery. Why would you throw that object at what he throws it at? Sorry...code to avoid spoiler. It just doesn't quite feel natural. Anyway, 9 out of 10. Watch it and you won't be disappointed.",10
"Thanks for entertainment. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.",8
What an incredible film...it chills my nerves watching this ...,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film that has captivated audiences since its release in 1994. Directed by Frank Darabont and based on Stephen King's novella, this cinematic gem has become a beloved classic and is often hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time. Some essential things make The Shawshank Redemption a must-watch and explore its enduring appeal.

The Plot: At its core, The Shawshank Redemption follows the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary.

Through their unlikely bond, the narrative unfolds, weaving a tale of hope, resilience, and the power of friendship. The film takes the audience on an emotional rollercoaster as they witness Andy's relentless pursuit of freedom and eventual redemption.

Cinematic Excellence: One cannot discuss The Shawshank Redemption without acknowledging the impeccable execution of its various elements. From the compelling performances to the seamless direction, every aspect of the film contributes to its brilliance. Tim Robbins delivers a powerhouse performance as Andy, effortlessly portraying the character's intelligence, strength, and unwavering determination. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is palpable, enhancing the authenticity of their friendship and making it the heart of the movie.

The Shawshank Redemption also stands out for its visually stunning cinematography. The deliberate use of color palettes and lighting techniques adds depth and symbolism to each scene, effectively immersing the viewer into the world of Shawshank. The hauntingly beautiful score by Thomas Newman complements the narrative perfectly, evoking a wide range of emotions that stay with the audience even after the credits roll.

Themes of Hope and Redemption: One of the main reasons The Shawshank Redemption resonates with audiences is its exploration of profound themes. The film depicts the indomitable power of hope amidst despair and the transformative nature of redemption. Through the character of Andy, we witness his unwavering belief in the possibility of a better future, inspiring others around him to hold onto their own dreams. The movie serves as a reminder that no matter how dire the circumstances may be, the human spirit can triumph against all odds.

Movie's importance: The Shawshank Redemption may not have achieved commercial success upon its initial release, but it garnered widespread critical acclaim and has since gained a dedicated following. Its enduring popularity can be attributed to its universal themes, nuanced storytelling, and exceptional performances. Over the years, the film has been celebrated for its profound messages of hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit.

The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences and inspire viewers around the world.

From the stellar performances to the expert direction, every aspect of this movie contributes to its enduring legacy. Whether you are a fan of drama, crime, or simply appreciate storytelling at its finest, The Shawshank Redemption is a must-watch that will leave a lasting impact on your heart and mind.",10
"Sometimes you go to the movies to be entertained, to escape, to laugh, to learn something, to be inspired and maybe to cry.

THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has it all. I have watched this film at least 10 times over the last couple decades and it never disappoints and just watched it again, hence the late review.

It has moral lessons and inspiration that are beyond comprehension. It has humanity that is beyond compare.

The story, the premise, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's acting, the music, cinematography are all as good as movies get.

It is such an emotional film - the human spirit is rejuvenated.",9
"Yeah this movie deserves to be known as one of the best ever made.

This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.

This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is rightfully considered a classic. There are no scenes that felt unnecessary from start to finish the story moves at a good pace. We see both the good and the bad inside the prison.

Hollywood has lost the ability to make good films nowadays.

Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns,",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. Every frame, every line of dialogue, and every performance in this film is a testament to the power of storytelling and filmmaking.

First and foremost, the performances are absolutely stellar. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver performances that are nothing short of iconic. Robbins' portrayal of Andy Dufresne is a tour de force, imbuing the character with a quiet strength and determination that is truly compelling. Freeman's portrayal of Red is equally mesmerizing, with his wise and soulful narration providing a perfect counterpoint to Robbins' character.

The screenplay, adapted from Stephen King's novella by Frank Darabont, is a work of art in itself. The dialogue is sharp, poignant, and often laced with a dark humor that adds depth to the narrative. The pacing is impeccable, allowing the story to unfold with a sense of both urgency and deliberation, keeping the audience engaged from start to finish.

One of the most striking aspects of The Shawshank Redemption is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions. From moments of heart-wrenching despair to soaring triumphs of the human spirit, the film takes its audience on an emotional rollercoaster that leaves a lasting impact.

The cinematography by Roger Deakins is nothing short of breathtaking. The way he captures the starkness of prison life juxtaposed with moments of transcendent beauty is a visual feast for the eyes. The use of light and shadow, particularly in the iconic ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" scene, is a testament to Deakins' mastery of his craft.

Moreover, Thomas Newman's hauntingly beautiful score serves as the perfect musical backdrop to the story. It weaves seamlessly with the narrative, enhancing the emotional resonance of each scene.

Beyond its technical brilliance, The Shawshank Redemption is a story of hope, friendship, and the enduring power of the human spirit. It reminds us that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is the potential for redemption and the possibility of finding meaning and purpose.",10
"i love movies!!! i really truly do. i realize that everyone on thisplanet has a love of their life. it may be a guy or a girl. it may be a sport, or it maybe a hobby or skill. for me, i love movies! i strongly believe in my heart that everyone loves movies in theor own special way. they all can have an effect on us in their own very special way. thats what makes them special. what films are special to you? i love asking that question becuase you would be amazed with the types of responses you might here! iwas once asked that question seriously about a month ago. "" tanner, what film is the most special to you?"" it took me about 2 seconds to give a response! it was easy....."" THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.""

everyone has a moment or two in their life that stands out above th rest. they are those special moments that will live with you for the rest of your life. i also find that these special moments come at time when you are least expecting it. when i sat down for the first time top watch this masterpiece i felt that i was going to be in for anything but..... i knew absolutley nothing about this film except it was a prison drama and it was long....wow....i was really on the edge of my seat! about 2 hours and 30 minutes later when the credits began to roll against that beautiful heavenly landscape i could only think one thing.... "" this will forever be the greatest motion picute i have ever seen!""

when one talks about their favorite all-time movie one usually hears the same responses: THE GODFATHER, SCHINDLER'S LIST, CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA.... these are the usual nominees. i have been thrilled to see THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION being added to this nominee list more frequently! why is this happening? it is truly one of the all- time great hollywood stories! the film came out in 1994 to dismal boxoffice and while it received strong reviews...it failed to gather an audience. this even proved to be true when the film gatherd 7 oscar nominations including best picture. than....when it seemed as if this film had been lost forever a miracle happened.....it came to video and television. becoming more and more praised through word of mouth on video, the film reached a new public view when it premiered on TNT to a record viewing audience for a film. the film sincer than has become nothing short of the ""ITS WONDERFUL LIFE"" of hte 21st century!!! it meens that much to people!

why is this filmed loved and appreciated by so many people? i beleive the answer is oh so simple. the film is unlike any love story ever made; the film is a love story between two men! we become increasingly involved with these two men as we learn about them. we eventually begin to care deeply about these men and their friendship. the wonderful, music, cinematography, and direction bring us a film and a story that has touched our hearts in a way that no other story has before. this film focuses on the two greatest thems in all of life: hope and friendship! we learn through the film that one cannot exist without the other....just as andy and red cannot live without their beautiful friendship formed against all odds.

as we are shown throughout the film the many unnecassary horrors and butalities life can bring, then we are shown as the clouds break....just how wonderful, special, and beautiful life can be. this film accomplishes this task like no other film has in history.

walk with andy and red as their friendship grows into a love none of these men thought could ever exit for them again. we see them as their friendship brings a light into lives that we all dream about, but seldom find. its that darn good!!!!!

so....what am i finally getting at. if there ever comes a day in your life when you might lose sight of all the glory and beauty that is life.....if you ever want to see what can happen if you have hope.....if you ever want to know that a happy ending does truly exist for all of us in the end.... sit down, place the film in your vcr...and be prepared to see a display of all these themes of life in a light that you cant even imagine!!! ""GET BUSY LIVI'N....OR GET BUSY DYI'N....thats dam right!!!!""",10
"""Schindler's List"" is an emotionally devastating masterpiece that powerfully captures the horrors of the Holocaust while also celebrating the indomitable human spirit. Steven Spielberg's direction is nothing short of brilliant, and Liam Neeson's portrayal of Oskar Schindler is hauntingly poignant, making this film a timeless testament to the capacity for good in the face of unspeakable evil. The black-and-white cinematography, the haunting score by John Williams, and the outstanding performances from the entire cast combine to create an unforgettable cinematic experience that leaves a profound impact on the viewer. ""Schindler's List"" is a harrowing, essential work of art that serves as a stark reminder of the atrocities of the past and the importance of never forgetting them.",10
"The Good: The story is Epic. The acting is top notch. The message is sublime. The writing is off the charts. The cinematography is superb. The soundtrack (when there is music) is great and even symbolic to the story. You want a movie that excellently tells a story about I guy going to prison and at the same time demonstrates the universal value of self-forgiveness,patience, and sear determination ? THIS is the movie and THIS is how you do it.

The Bad: None. One of the few films I give 10/10,

The Ugly: Hahhahaha. If you think there is any ugly in this movie, may Morgan Freeman have mercy on soul. Just watch the movie.",10
"most reviews measure up up to the book,,,, but this movie is better than the book....... it is the cast you see that does it

I did read the book after reading the book.... and found a tighter story..... I will watch it anytime it's os on,,,,, I do have a greater understanding of the story ........ THIS is a great movie,,,,,, if you can watch 1 movie...is is one of the top 100. even the top 50 for all, who want to tell, a story that is a template to use........hope is a thing.... that nobody can estimate and,,, no one can judge..... stories,,,,,

everybody is innocent....",8
Just awesome...loved the movie... my all time favourite,10
"Ne of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.",8
This movie is a classic and will watch for years to come !! I highly recommend it. All the actors are great and the scenes will keep you on your feet !! I have already watched it 20 times and purchased a copy that will forever live in my video library .......If you love drama this is the movie to watch,9
I was expecting something else entirely to a better movie. Sorry not impressed me so even give birth. The only thing I liked was how they interpreted actors.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption isn't just a film-it's an experience, a poignant exploration of human endurance in the face of profound adversity. Set against the grim backdrop of a maximum-security prison, this narrative seamlessly intertwines themes of injustice, friendship, and indomitable hope. Robbins delivers a beautifully understated performance as Andy Dufresne, while Freeman's portrayal of Red is both captivating and heartfelt, offering a voice that guides us through the shadowy confines of Shawshank. Director Frank Darabont's storytelling prowess shines, turning Stephen King's novella into a cinematic triumph that resonates deeply. Its powerful climax and memorable score leave a lasting impact, making it a compelling watch, time and again. This film isn't just one of my all-time favorites-it's a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and an absolute must-see for every cinephile.",10
"I think that those who are saying that the movie is unoriginal is unaware of what a sequal is. It is the same demon, so some of the same things will still occur. It differs from the original in that there are a couple of jump scares, and the entire way around getting an exorcism is different. The fact that the possessed girl goes into a chick has only been done in one other movie, that I can think of, and that's one of that annabelle movies. I think that others are comparing it to other 2023 horror movies where you much be at the edge of your seat the entire time, while that is just not the case for the original (when viewing now), or the new version of it. It makes amazing references to the first movie, and was honestly one of the best horror movie ""sequals"" that has come out from an original in the last few years.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a 1994 dramatic film and adaptation written and directed by Frank Darabont. Inspired by Stephen King's story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"".

The film is about the wrongful imprisonment of a banker named Andy Dufresne and his life in prison. Despite being wrongfully accused, Andy remains hopeful and humane and fosters change by forming friendships among the inmates. ""The Redemption of Slavery"" deals with universal themes such as not losing the goodness and hope within man, friendship, freedom and justice.

The acting performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the emotional depth and character development in the film were praised by the audience. The film has achieved cult status over time and is among the best films in cinema history. It is considered a production that is both critically successful and loved by audiences.",10
This movie is just simply fantastic. Every scene is perfect. I had a very good time watching it. It is definitely a must-see.,10
"I've watched this movie for many times. Each time I'm moved. Although the director is not the best, the actors are not the best, the story is the best story that I've ever known, at the end, it leads to the best movie I've ever seen. I'm a movie fun, and quite famous among my classmates. One day they came to me and said to me:"" Hey, you've watched so many movies, which one is mostly worth watching?"", I answered:"" You get the right person, Shawshank Redemption.""""What? Never heart."" Then they took the Video from me. One hour later they came back.""Are you kidding? It's so boring, that we even couldn't get though of it. I smiled,"" I've only one advice, watch it over, please."" Hours passed..., when they came back to again, you can imagine the expression on their faces. ""wonderful..."",just one word, they could give to me. Hope and freedom are the mean subject of this film. They are so beautiful, that anybody can be moved, no limit of countries, no limit of races. It's the treasure of whole humankind. ""Hope the most beautiful thing in the world. It's deeply in your mind, only one thing really belongs to you, no one can touch it..."" How I hope it's a true story... It's best story I've ever known, it's the best movie I've ever seen.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into the human spirit's resilience. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver compelling performances, portraying the enduring friendship between two prisoners. The film's poignant narrative, gripping plot twists, and themes of hope and redemption make it a timeless classic that resonates with audiences across generations. With its powerful storytelling and emotive storytelling, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remains a must-watch for all movie enthusiasts. Darabont's direction, coupled with Stephen King's poignant storytelling, creates an unforgettable cinematic experience that continues to resonate with viewers worldwide.",10
"Best movie I have seen in my life This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. Movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.",10
"I never Seen Before Like This Fantastic Movie,This Is my Favorited Movie which i saw , and i recommend to my Friends to watch this awesome movie what a direction and the roles are played very natural in this movie the acting is awesome.I appreciate the stars who played such an awesome roles.",10
"However delightful as it is The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance.

It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches it's only a very safe buddy story A damn good one but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for Friendship Huh neat At the end of the day Shawshank is a good film but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review as countless others have done but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is it's about as likable and massmarketed as possible There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences it plays it safe and in my opinion a bit too safe. I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film .

Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry but I found it utterly average I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker.",10
"For someone who always thinks they are being wrongly accused of something, this movie is the ultimate journey of one man's redemption and triumph over his past. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the entire cast are flawless in their performances and this movie hits the head right on the nose with the social justice politics and policies of the time period that the movie appeared in. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good ""man vs. nature"" story. One of my favorite scenes is when Timothy plays the opera music in the office. The Italian arias that the two women sing are incredibly beautiful and speak to the caged bird that he has become who wants to break free and soar past his circumstances",9
"Deserves an Oscar for the vignette around Brooks Hatlen alone. When film students begin the path of learning about the art of motion pictures, they would be well served to study this as an example of what can be accomplished by a master craftsman.

Using a simple plot as a foundation around which all the necessary detail and thoughtful insight of human conditions can be layered, this is the closest you can come to telling a story flawlessly on film.

Screw all that. How good is it? Every single time I'm flipping through the channels and I see it's on, it doesn't matter where it is in the plot or time-line, I stop and watch.

Every time.",9
"Simply one of the FINEST movies ever produced by Hollywood. Great in all aspects - acting, story line, cinematography and dialogue!

Dont miss this in your life time!

I rate it 4 over 5",10
"What more can be said about this film? It was a short story given a big budget but flopped at the box office, likely thought of as just another prison film. Then people began watching copies and by word-of-mouth the characters, the plot, the sheer brilliance of the story grew so as it became almost legend.

Gripping, harrowing, horrific, and finally uplifting due to its totally unexpected ending you may well find yourself appalled, laughing, sad, angry and finally even shed some tears whilst watching this intelligent and moving film. The ending is exceptional.

A cinematic masterpiece, now enhanced by being available on BluRay and well worth obtaining.",9
If you wanna learn a new lesson about life. You should watch it.,10
"I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie or not, but my brother kept raving about it and finally made me watch. I'm tremendously glad he did.

The acting is perfectly accurate and plot leaves no gaps or unbelievable events that spoil the whole movie. This movie was amazing and was instantly my favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is absolutely perfect and so are Robbins and the rest of the cast. Wonderfully well put together as Freeman narrates his character's (Red) thoughts which I thought was pretty cool.

I've never written a comment on IMDb, but this moment compelled me to write one. By far my favorite movie of all time.",8
This is one of the best movie I have ever seen. I changed myself many things. Thank you director and storytelling,9
"One of the ways that I figure out if a movie is really good or not is by watching it several times and seeing if it keeps my interest.

Some movies are just good movies with people that you associate with and like to be around. ""Forrest Gump"".

Some movies make you envy the star or the character and make you a better person for the watching (Gary Cooper in High Noon).

Some movies are just cool (Pulp Fiction).

This movie is one you want to watch because you feel the respect between two men, the determination of one man, and the power of friendship. Watching Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman develop their relationship over the course of 20+ years is a journey you don't want to miss and a journey that you enjoy seeing over and over again. The grit and determination to survive in a world that was so alien to Andy is a revelation on the human spirit.

Finally the friendship that Andy and Red developed, kept Red from committing another crime just to go back to something safe and familiar. This is a testimony to the ability for one man to truly change the life of another. This is one of the three best movies of the 90's and one of the best films of all time.",10
"Having read Stephen King's short story when it was first published I never would have predicted it would be made into a movie. The movie adaptation is also alot more interesting than the original story, mainly because the characters are better developed and the story is livlier. This is one of the few movies that surpasses the book. The weakest point of this movie is the rather one-sided view of the penal system, even in the dated version of this story.",10
"It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.",9
"If you are looking for a movie about strong human feelings you should see this one. Stories like this make you believe again in people's strength. It's amazing how faith and hope could take the character so high, up to the point of taking everything jail had for him. His need of freedom takes his mind away from that terrible place.

Man, every time I see the scene where he is down the rain and he looks up, i get chickenskinned. This is a beautiful story.

Everyone of the actors did a great job.",8
"Shawshank Redemption, a true heart warming epic has sat in my heart among my favorites. Tim Robbins has given the performance of his life, even after watching the movie again and again, i cant stop thinking what he did, how patient and intelligent the guy was that even his closest friend morgan freeman cant think of what he can do or what he did. The strong dialogues and the delivery makes an unstoppable emotional attachement between the characters and audience. If you havent seen it, dont blame me why you are missing it.",10
"This movie is so timeless...it is definitely an instant classic. This isn't even my type of movie, but if you have a heart, you will be extremely moved by this touching story. I would never hesitate in recommending this movie to anyone!",10
"No spoilers, no repeated synopsis from me.

Just some heartfelt advice to sit down and enjoy the experience of this beautifully-told story.

Don't read what it's about - just find it on a streaming service, or on a second-hand store's DVD shelf, or perhaps a friend or family member has a copy. However you find it - get it - watch it - you won't regret it.

Written, Directed, Acted, and crafted so well that you too will see why it's 10/10 for most people.",10
The best film ever made! Everything about this film is a high standard and inspirational!,9
"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.

TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as ""the only guilty man in Shawshank."" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape.

Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.

It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.",10
The movie was just brilliant. Just the right actors had been picked and the movie was just great. I recommend sincerely if you haven't already seen it.,10
"Forget Citizen Kane, A Clockwork Orange, Apocalypse Now, Midnight Cowboy, and some of the other so-called best movies of all time. Those movies are overblown, egotistical, Hollywood film maker elitish crap. Not to say they are bad movies, just way overrated.

Shawshank is different. I have seen this movie, literally, hundreds of times. I watch every time I see it on TV. I will never tire of it. It is as close to perfect as a movie can be. It evokes every human emotion you can imagine, but never allows itself to mire in any of them. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are superb. James Whitmore as the ""institutionalized"" Brooks Hatlen, just breaks my heart in his last few scenes. You grow to truly care about these people. The ending is just and satisfying and makes you think, even if only for a few minutes, that everything will be right with the world.",10
"First, I would like to say I did not see this film when it originally came out in the movies. The trailers and the fact it was a ""prison"" film never interested me. My manager recommended it about three years ago to me when I was looking for films to rent on a cold snowy weekend. Because it did have Morgan Freeman in it, I made a mental note and said to myself, ""If its available I may give it a go"". All my manager would tell me was it was ""long, drawn out and tedious"" but that I should hang with it cause it would be ""well worth the wait"". Now he's a decent manager but our lifestyles are so different outside of work, I was like ""yeah right. He would recommend something that I would like."" But it was available and I rented it. I held on to it for seven days, about to just take it back since it was due without watching it but hey--I hated to feel like I wasted money.

I watched it and I did not waste my money.

This has become to me one of the best films I have ever seen(so far) in my life. It was long but I got into it slowly, methodically and so captivatingly, the time drifted slowly. Sucking me in, I could hardly know what to expect. And what I expected didn't happen and I just was transfixed. Tim Robbins to me was brilliant. He painstakingly went through those years, aging and moving forward through all the disappointments, growth and experiences as if he were in a long chess game. I became so caught up I could not even begin to think about how this would turn out all the stories and events.

And when the end came, I was just blown away by it. I truly loved all performances and so many ""character actors"" now are faces and names I know and they all performed well and are remembered in my head when I see them--for this movie.

I find myself recommending it now to people and I too ask them to ""hang with it. its well worth the wait"".",4
Never gets old. A masterpiece and worth watching more than once. Little details emerge that you might not have noticed first time round.,7
The best movie I've seen so far. it is from 1994 but it is still in the top,10
"There is something in each one of us, which nobody can touch, defile or pollute. That is our sacred place where resides our strength, hopes, dreams and character.

What this movie amazingly shows us is that it is possible to access our strength and keep alive our hopes when situations would otherwise defeat us.

I have seen Shawshank 3 times over a span of 8 years. I can't see it again and again as it hurts...it's so perfect. When I viewed the movie for the first time, all by myself, it was on a cold winter morning. Who would go and see a movie 9 am on a regular working/week day (college, actually)? But the international film festival was on in my city and it was the last screening of the movie in the festival. So I missed some lectures, rode through the morning fog, and sat long after the projector was switched off in the theater to an incredible movie experience. The press and public had given the Shawshank a standing ovation that day.

And I was aching to share it. So saw the movie again, once with my father and once recently with my husband.

Just now when I happened to see the Top movies listed on IMDb and that Shawshank is listed at no.2, I was hit by the memory of that cold winter morning.

And when I clicked away and read other viewers comments, I noticed how majority of them remember vividly the how, when and where they had seen this film for the first time. For most, like me, it was an unforgettable thing.

Just wanted to applaud the voters at IMDb to give Shawshank the right spot on all time top movies. I went and registered with the web site right now, just that I too could add a vote in its favor.

9 out of 10!",10
A stunning example of the craft of film making in all aspects.,10
"I am sorry to say that one who hasn’t seen ‘Shawshank Redemption’ hasn’t had experienced any good English films yet. But I was wondering how such an awesome film could be deprived of an Oscar and to add a pinch of salt to injuries, I was zapped to find that ‘Forest Gump’ was considered as best pictures, Robert Zemeckis as best director and Tom Hanks for best actor. No offence, I am a die hard fan of Tom Hanks. Not to mention his performance in ‘Philadelphia’, Oscar was written all over it. But in ‘Forest Gump’!!!!! He could have got it in ‘Cast Away’ had ‘Russell Crowe not been there in ‘Gladiator’. But in ‘Forest Gump’ in comparison to ‘Morgan Freeman’ in ‘Shawshank Redemption’, I personally don’t buy the idea. As far as ‘Best Picture’ is concerned, again how in the world could ‘Forest Gump’ earn the best picture award when ‘Pulp Fiction’ & ‘Shaw shank Redemption’ were there in the proximity? One of the prime features of ‘Shawshank Redemption’ is its dialogues, so heart rending. The cinematography, acting of Tim Robbins, (Andy Dufresne) an innocent banker, sentenced 30years back to back is so brilliantly executed and ‘Morgan Freeman’ my man, my ‘Red’ is simply outstanding. It is his best performance till date (Don’t know about ‘Invictus’ though (2010)) and to me it is undoubtedly better than ‘Million Dollar Baby’ (in which he finally got the Oscar). I personally feel sorry for Frank Darabont, ‘Shawshank’ is probably the best film of his life. A rare gem did not get its true worth. No wonder it is no. 1 out of the top 250 films on IMDb, (9.2 out of 10). I give it 10.",9

"the movie is life changer Out of any film that has ever been made, this is my far the best one. It's just so special and moving. Such a deep and touching message about life and the institutionalization aspects of prison life. It really touches the inner hopefulness in all of us, or at least everyone who has seen this movie. If you've never seen it, watch it,",10
This is the best of the best movie of all time...!!!,10
"At one time this movie was my faveorite of all time, but then I saw it repeated 2000 times on Turner's cable networks. Although the book by Stephen King is much better than the movie, the message that hope lives on, remains. I have to admit that I never liked Tim Robbins untill I saw this movie, but I thought he did an excellent job in what is one of the great movies of the nineties.",10
"I have just finished watching this movie, and I have no words in how to describe this movie. It is absolutely the best movie I have ever seen. I have given this movie a 10 because the story is almost life changing, and differs the views of people about the world. Everybody should get a chance to watch this movie, it is life changing! Ten out of ten should definitely be the number 1 movie of all time, because it is such a good story, with such moving acting.",10
I really enjoyed this one. The lead actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. I never felt like there were any scenes that left me feeling empty. There were parts in the movie that I felt like I knew how the emotions of the characters actually felt. Needless to say I believed them. I find it hard to watch movies where I don't believe the characters in the movie. But these guys really did their job. Of course I usually find myself enjoying the roles that Morgan Freeman plays. He's got a great knack for this sort of stuff. I was really glad that I watched this one and will watch it many more times in the future.,10
"During watching this movie,You just forget that you are watching a movie ,it means that much emotional and realistic Performance by TIM ROBBINS AND MORGAN FREEMAN...........10/10",10
"No spoilers here.

A remarkable Stephen King penned story. King has often found ways of getting to wonder about even our most strongly held values. Most consider people in prison as throwaway members of society, and those that guard the prisons as public servants. King twists this into the protagonist prisoner (Robbins) against the hopelessness of prison and the brutal display of power by the warden. The story is beautifully narrated by Morgan Freeman as ex-con Red.

It lost out to Tom Hanks' portrayal of Forrest Gump for Best Picture, which is a shame, but I'll never forget the impact it made on me.

The film has an edge, and a heart. I couldn't recommend it enough.",10
This movie change my life forever..all time best movie.,5
"In 1994 I saw Pulp Fiction in the theater 5 times. I was obsessed with it. Still am...it's my #2, and on occasion, #1. But there was another film I saw multiple times in the theater in '94 - The Shawshank Redemption.

And this one, hardly anyone saw in the theater. Nobody really knew about it, until all of a sudden it was nominated for Best Picture and lots more Oscars. But honestly no one in the world thought it would win, I'm sure the Vegas odds were laughable. And of course Forrest Gump overshadowed both Shawshank & Pulp Fiction.

So Shawshank was my film for years, I found it - randomly at my local theater. I owned it on VHS, I watched it incessantly. It's been my favorite film for 20 years.

It's well known it gained a cult following on VHS. But IMDb really put it on the map. And IMDb is to be thanked for the last 7 or 8 years, of idiots who've just come into the film recently claiming it's ""a trendy film to claim as your favorite."" I want to get physically violent with people who say that. Rather, it's trendy for idiots to say it's trendy to love Shawshank.

It doesn't matter. Shawshank is timeless. It is so layered, so thick & dense with ideas & emotions, subtleties & nuance & little moments that are gigantic. Watching Shawshank is a spiritual experience, a journey that never gets old. It's a drug.

God, I just saw IMDb is getting close to racking up 1,200,000 votes on Shawshank. And 9.3. You cannot argue with that. It cuts across cultures, sexes, and races.

Unbelievable miracle of a film, created by sunlight itself.",10
"Nothing to say with this masterpiece ,this movie was so much touching and the soundtrack was PERFECTO thanks to this lovley quality",7
"Every time I see this film, I am filled with dark thoughts which ultimately gets overshadowed by hope. After all these years, this one still stands in number one list and one of my few reasons to join movie industry.

Well, so many things have been said and written, so I want to focus on one particular note-patience. Yes, friendship is the key theme of the movie that propels the plot till the very last shot of the film since the beginning of the narration but apart from the main theme of film being hope and friendship, this film strongly con-notates the power of patience and persistence.

Would not like to talk about the entire story here but next time you watch this, just take a close look at Andy, and the way he holds his emotion at the beginning in the court and till the very end when he wears the polished shoe of Warden, no doubt there is deep sorrow and regret but above all, a sign of hope and his patience to make things happen is always there throughout the movie-be it winning to get the books, more books or even beer for his friends despite he doesn't drink himself.

Well, I always discover so many hidden subtle meanings every time I watch this, I loose track of the information and the key things but for sure, apart of Hope and Friendship thing, patience and persistence tops the reason why is film is so courageous in its way.",10
"I really do think that this movie has earned a place in the illustrious halls of Imdb at the number two position. This movie gives you more each time you see it. It is not an exercise of the mind, rather a true introspection of the spirit, that reveals to each of us what we can only hope to become.

However, I do think that Fraggle Rock deserves a place at number four.",10

"This movie makes me feel like the energizer bunny - I can keep watching and watching and watching...It's incredible. The Shawshank Redemption is of the few movies which I can watch always, even if I know what's coming.",10
"This movie can be summed up into just that word, WOW. I mean out of all the movies i have seen in my life this one i have loved from the first time i watched it to the last time watched it. Everytime this movie is just as exciting and interesting as the time before. It has a great cast and story and truly captures the fight of oppression and the challenges of the Human Spirit. Very inspirational and a timeless classic.",10
"Its a wonderful film to watch, with different moods and sub plots throughout the film all woven together beautifully.",10
"Motivational movie with good content, story, direction, actuon and screenplay is the hero",9
"This is without a doubt my favorite movie. I can see this movie so many times, and I never get tired, because I always feel the magic and the beauty of it. Almost all the time when I talk about movies, I strongly recommend The Shawshank Redemption.

The roles of Andy Dufresne, Red, Brooks and several others are very well performed. This movie just have it all: excellent music, it's fantastically written, good acting, etc.

It's so hard to believe that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes, but the best of all is that The IMDb voters have it at #1. It really deserves to be at the top.",9
"It's weird to see a good rated movie only after ten years and find yourself smiling happily at the end. There are less and less movies able to provide that feeling.

The Shawshank Redemption is one great movie that reaches to your heart and mind and makes them both better. I won't go around comment about how it's like or how it's been made. I just wanted to share what it made me feel like.

If you haven't seen it, go out, rent it and watch it. It's definitely worth the time and the money. I finally understand why its rating is that high.",9
"Don't miss it.

The depiction of brutal injustice and hopelessness in this movie is utterly convincing. I was totally taken in, and by 80% of the way through was dreading the end: on the one hand, I knew that stagnation, institutionalization and hopelessness are the fates to be expected in the U. S. prison system, and would not be disappointed or surprised to see an end similar to the beginning in those regards; on the other hand, I hoped for some kind of positive uplift at the end. Unfortunately I was disappointed in both expectations. The Hollywood ending was too contrived and unbelievable to maintain the high level of realism of the first part of the movie.

1. You cannot tunnel through 15 feet of concrete with a rock hammer, even in 20 years. 2. A Portland newspaper cannot banner-headline a prison corruption story, ever. 3. The Warden could have notified all the banks to expect an escapee masquerading as a customer before Dufresne could have withdrawn funds from 10 banks. Have you tried to close a bank account recently? 4. Dufresne could not have kept his suit and papers intact crawling through 500 yards of sewer pipe.

Etc., etc. No ending is better than a contrived feel-good ending. Were the producers concerned that we might be too inspired to advocate prison reform unless they gave us a shot of feel-good at the end? Fortunately the power and artistic perfection of the first part of the movie dominates.

Very disturbing and powerful. I am grateful for the conversation it inspired between my stepdaughter, my girlfriend and myself this morning. We ranged over the Massachusetts Geoghan case, the death penalty, criminal justice in the U. s. vs. China, and the thousands of movies that do NOT have Hollywood endings.",10
"Without The Shawshank Redemption, which can be called best?! These day, i check in every day in time with my suit, and live a peaceful life. some day, i feel not good, i need refresh my soul, i need bring some light into my heart. so i get The Shawshank Redemption and watch it. It has been 15 years after Frank Darabont made The Shawshank Redemption this greatest movie until now. It says:""the greatest makes every one feel in the same greatest way"",The Shawshank Redemption is something like this. When some one got be sentenced to spend his rest entire life in the prison, the more hope he carries, the more dangerous he is. but Andy told Red, hope is good, and goodness never die. so Andy can hold his hope and dig the tunnel to out of Shawshank, when he finally crosses the tunnel, and shout aloud under the rain. the faith of hope breaks every nest.",10
The Shawshank Redemption is by far the best movie I ever seen. I saw this movie more times than i can think.. it will never get old.. the plot the people everything is just at point I recommend it to everyone it is a MUST movie for all Humans! you will not regret it (I really hope it will stay IMDb 1st movie of all times for all times),10
"`The Shawshank Redemption' tells the story of wrongly accused murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and his story of survival inside a maximum-security prison. As Andy enters Shawshank prison, he soon realizes his innocence doesn't matter. He's in a place where everybody thinks they are innocent. Andy is portrayed from the view of a second person, and most of the time we see what this second person sees. He meets Ellis `Red' Reddings (Morgan Freeman), the man who can get things from the outside. Red was able to obtain almost anything the prisoners want, but always for a price. Slowly a friendship grows between Andy and Red. It's interesting Red is the only `guilty' man in Shawshank Prison. This movie is not about the normal prison violence that is seen in many prison films. There is some violence, but nothing too drastic. The film focuses more on making the best of a bad situation. Andy demonstrates if a person's life is based on strong values, he doesn't compromise his values in any situation. Often these values can affect others in a positive way. Andy never gave up his hope, his hope that someday things will go right. The tagline `get busy living, or get busy dying' sums up the message of the film. It is a good film. It has a simple story that is easy to follow. The acting is good, and the director Frank Darabont, is able to keep me interested through the entire movie. It also has a surprising and memorable ending. I don't know much about prison life and how it really is, but there are a few things which seem a little unrealistic: alcohol for the work crew, and how Red is able to obtain almost anything the prisoners want. Overall, it's a good movie. It can give the viewer something to think about and maybe learn from.",8
"This is a classic movie, kind of an adventure which will give you goosebumps for many days. Highly recommended. This movie has so more than one story going on and it needs a real good observation to understand all the aspects. If you can watch it with film critics, watch it as they will add a new angle to watching the movie. After watching try to add some of the aspects of the movie to your life as this movie teaches us many lessons of life.It also shows to us that how harsh prison life can be and a person needs to be mentally strong to handle himself in the jail.He must also make friends in jail as they can help him.",10
"I too, will not go into the plot details, etc. We actually visited the Ohio Reformatory in Mansfield Ohio today, where it was filmed - it's the 25th Anniversary and it was well worth the trip and tour. After we returned home, we viewed the movie (just finished it), and having been there, it gives new depth to the film. If you ever get the chance to visit the Shawshank Trail, or just tour the Reformatory, do it.",9
"With all due respect to Forrest Gump, this was the real best picture of 1994. Tim Robbins gives the best performance of his career, and Morgan Freeman is his usually outstanding self. The story is totally engrossing, and never loses your attention. And if you are watching the movie for the first time, the ending will throw you for a loop. This is one of the most underrated films of all time. It deserves must more respect than it usually receives.",10
"The movie of a lifetime. I'm not going to compare it with the Forrest Gump or the Godfather series, but this movie stands out saying 'I'm the One!'.

Remarkably perfect screenplay, wonderful dialogues and an unmatched cast, this movie takes you to a journey through a life of a prisoner. You never get bored of the movie even for a split-second though the movie goes beyond 2 and a half hours if I remember. You realize what it is to be a prisoner and its horrible after effects and the deferment of human rights there. Perhaps you may have committed a crime, but that surely makes you think twice before you commit a mistake/crime.

Unmatchable cinematography and this movie indeed sets a benchmark for the ones to follow!",9
"There is one simple reason why the Shawshank Redemption is the second best movie I've ever seen. It made me want to be a BETTER PERSON. It actually changed my life. I wanted to help and be kinder to others after watching it. The character of Andy defines the human spirit and how a person whose life is based on values of honesty, goodness, and freedom, will not be compromised no matter what the situation. Others may have their opinions that it isn't that great based on artistic and technical merits, but they don't understand, it is the STORY that is compelling and what that story represents. The reason it is #2 in the voting is because it resonates that universal truth of the human spirit. It also portrays how one person by being resolute in their goodness can affect others and lift them up. That is why this movie has so many emotional high points. Andy is constantly lifting those around him and making their lives better even in one of the hell holes of our society. The two most emotional points in the movie for me are when he plays the music and when Andy and Red embrace on the beach in Zihuatenejo, Mexico.

(Bye the way, my #1 favorite movie of all time is 'A Man for All Seasons' which is similar to Shashank in that it tells the story of a man who is uncompromising in his beliefs.)",10
"This movie gets you out of any bad mood to a state of serenity, Every conversation got deep meanings inside of it.

The Shawshank redemption was made to inspire all of us to never ever give up. The cast just fit right in their roles their voices move the right feelings in the right time. Tim Robbins gave his best performance of all time the way he talks and walks reflects his calm personality in the movie with a smile always on his face. Morgan freeman was great as usual specially as a narrator.

excellent performance and great story sets an example of friendship and hope. A must see for everyone.",9
"Everything about shawshank is memorable. Both Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman deliver wonderful performances, the dark mood settings in the prison and Andy(Tim Robbins)response to these drab settings, the superb cinematography, the masterful plot with its unique twist, the soundtrack,the simple idea of hping to be free. What more can i say, its truly a modern day masterpiece.",10
"Thats movie change a lot of things in mylife, my oppinion and behave. realy so real and feeling",9
Great movie i thought because its toooo real.. the same thing basicly today just in in another form. two of my favorite actors,10
"Definitely a really good movie but not the best. I don""t really feel like to watch this movie again and again, I believe people rates effect each others that's why it is going stay as number 1 forever.",10
"I'm just curious and interested in taking a poll here since just about everyone (or at least a lot of people that I know of) keeps on insisting that original written works are ""always better"" than their actual on-screen adaptions. But, seeing as how this is currently IMDb's #1 rated film of all-time...

As for myself, I have not seen the movie nor read the book, and so I have no opinion on the matter; I'm merely challenging the aforementioned statement based on what other people (who have both read the book and seen the movie adaption) think.

One of the best movies I never forget! Both actors are great! No doubt it is listed in IMDB's top movies.,10
"When I raad the book in 90's I remember that I was think to my self like ""Wow, if they make it a movie, it would be awesome"".",10
I have just watched this film for the third time and it still knocks me for 6 and brings tears to my eyes. It is criminal that this film did not win any awards. That does not matter because in time if not already it will without doubt go down as the greatest film of all time. Nothing gets anywhere near it.,10
"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I think I was 14 years the first time I saw it. Mamma tell us a little for me before I got to cuddle me down on the couch and watch a movie for over 2 hours - That it has with little trouble and jail to do. After I saw the movie I wanted it to continue. Wish in the future to it will continue. You'll see how 'Red' experience meeting along with Andy Dufresne. You get to see how they manage the prison with fractions, friendship & grief. Or what happens to the 'Red' & Andy's friends. Think it would make a great blow through all categories of stellar top! I have even heard of me to Castle Rock & other to give them a tip about making a new sequel.",10
"Many, including myself, would wonder what the point is of writing the 4,368th review of this film.

Well, I have been a member of this website under one log-in or another for the last couple of decades and never written a review, so if i'm going to write just one review, it may as well be about the best film ever made I suppose.

The Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly, in my opinion, deserves to be the highest rated movie of all time. It is a film you can watch again and again and take something more from it each time. It is simply life affirming, which we often need in these times where so many of us float through life, not appreciating what we have, and taking simple pleasures for granted.

It is a moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. The friendship between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is fantastic.I feel sorry for people who say this film is overrated. Not because I don't respect that other people have different opinions, but because if you cannot appreciate this film and the messages it gives us, then I feel you are missing out.

If anyone ever bothers to read this, the 4,368th review of this film, then I thank you for reading the only review I feel the need to write.",10
"I usually don't write reviews but this has got to be said, hands-down the most magnificent movie I have ever seen! One of the few movies that actually made me cry and I'm a grown man. It had it's cries, laughs, anger, and happiness all in one complete package. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and this film truly holds him to be legendary. There is nothing about this movie I would change, absolutely perfect no complaints here. I can watch this 10+ times and still have the emotions I had when I first watch it. A must watch for everyone (age appropriate of course) because this is a masterpiece you cannot not see. You feel what the characters feel, you are part of the movie. Beautiful, stunning and heartwarming, I cannot stress enough how much this movie touched me.",10
"This movie is the best movie ever for me ! He deserve the first place ! Story : ""Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" -This short story said everything about this movie, i liked all the personality, specially the hero of the movie. The Director Frank Darabont he had know how to play with all the personalities and their roles. So great thank to him because he make a great movie. For the stars, ""Tim Robbins"" he's my best actor all time ! 14 October 1994 is a special day, so always remember it ! :D I liked everything about the movie, even the Soundtracks. I think in our day we missed the movies such as The Shawshank Redemption :(",10
"This movie has lot's of depth and it's somewhat a rollercoaster with your emotion.

Have You not seen it, give it a go. It is old yet one of those films You should have seen at least once. I believe I've seen it about 7 times.

The story is told perfectly and it's not to dark, it has it's bright moments.",10
Best movie Ive ever seen...and i love it so very much,10
"Some people say that cinema art has one purpose. Awake all our senses and lead us to it's own paths ..,well this movie does it very well ...is Art!!!!.... It's a picture about friendship , the value of life and the importance of education ..... the point its to be free wherever you are....some people are not in prison but live in fear for everyday difficulties and lose all the courage they have about life but our characters have the strength to feel free inside and catch their dream outside the prison. This movie directed perfectly !!!! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman saw to us their tremendous talent !!! . A must see !!! p.s : is the best movie i have ever seen !!!",10
"This is a great film. It is well constructed, the acting is superb and the characters are so likable or in the case of the pigs so detestable. This movie is one of those that makes you think deep about life, your life! Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere.",10
"Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.",10
"My personal opinion is that the Shawshank Redemption is the greatest film ever made. However I fully appreciate the fact that this is not everybodys opinion. My knowledge of the film industry while not conclusive, is considerably extensive, and in my short time on earth I would like to believe that I have seen enough movies and learned enough about them to warrant comment on this particular gem. From the opening sequence to the memorable finale, this is filmaking at its finest hour. Yes, the overall message may be simple, but the study of human nature throughout the film relays the complexities and frailties of the human race. I dont think there is one fault in this film and I have watched it many times now. I have seen many film opinion polls at this stage and I cannot remember shawshank being outside the top five in any of them. So we all cant be wrong. What it all boils down to is whether or not a film can move you, or leave a profound effect on you. Films like Shawshank, Seven, Braveheart, American History X and Jaws had a hugh effect on me, these films to me are what makes movies magical. For someone else it might be pulp fiction, the godfather or its a wonderful life. The magic of the movies is the effect that a particular film has on the particular person. I think the shawshank redemption had a profound effect on so many people, because we can identify so well with the point its trying to put across (Hope is a good thing, even when all seems lost) and that true friendship can get us out of the worst of times. Films will always have their critics, thats the nature of the business, but I was always told they dont make them like they used to, this film is proof that they still can. P.S. Stephen King is a genius.",10
"This movie was actually filmed partly in my hometown. Plus, my dad's in it. So, I'm a little partial to it. But, I have NEVER talked to someone who hasn't absolutely loved this movie. It's definitely a must see!",1
"Everything is awesome in this movie!

The best for ever I think...",10
"The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",8
"Have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.",9
I WILL KEEP THIS SHORT.... If you haven't seen this movie you have wasted your life. Watch this movie as it will change the way you look at life. I have made it a priority to watch this movie at least once every year.,10
"I thought i've watched some really great movies in my life. The ironic thing is, every time i watch a movie that is great, i'll miss much of it because the TV is busy advertising some rubbish prime time movie like charlies angels.

Shawshank redemption is not a good movie, it's a GREAT movie. Thankfully, i got the DVD and finally watched it from start to finish. I've never watched a show that made me feel like watching over and over and over again like it has. The way the director captures human emotion, makes this one hell of a great prison movie.

The movie is great at the start, but none better when it comes closer to the end. Believe me, there will be a point your jaw will just hang open in amazement. I love this movie, if you've not watched it, please do so...",9
One of the greatest movie of all time. I still enjoy re-watching it once in a while.,10
"This has got to be one of the best movies of all time. The simplicity of the direction, the casting, the performance and the suspense in the end just adds to the beauty of the story line and script. As the summary says - Simply Brilliant! Needless to say, Morgan Freeman is what makes your heart love again in this one.",10
"Well i have watched all the movies listed on IMDb top 250,all the AFI 100 movies and other major titles.

But, without a single doubt in my mind, i can say this is by far, by far the most beautiful masterpiece that Hollywood ever produced. It is more than just a film because it takes you away with it. As Roger Ebert writes ""watching Shawshank takes away the feeling that you are watching a film"". That's exactly what it does to you, you become dissolve in the characters and are able to feel the atmosphere.

Tim Robbins as a quite Andy Dufresne is Brilliant. And Freeman as Red what can i say even at this moment while writing this comments I can feel his story narrating style and voice in my head.

Direction, Cinematography and Screenplay are excellent. You can't take you eyes from the screen for a second.

The climax is one of the best i have seen.

For people who haven't seen it i would like to say, you haven't seen the most beautiful work of Art in the World.

It deserves more than just ten Stars and seven Oscars nominations.",10
"This perfect prison drama has everything except women. Tim Robbins gives a truly majestic performance and should've been nominated for an Oscar alongside co-star Morgan Freeman (he's good, too). It's a whole lot better than other prison movies you see nowadays. The film is honest, deep, and shows that you can find hope in the most unlikely of places. I would give this movie ten thumbs up if I had ten thumbs. But since I don't, I'll just give it two. I wish Stephen King could write more honest stories like this one. Remember, this movie came beforere 'The Green Mile', and everyone knows classics are always better. It's nice to see that Hollywood can produce movies that aren't complete garbage.",10
"This is definitely one of the best movies ever made. Hard to choose first, as comparing different genres is not fair.

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman roles will stay in your memories forever. The way the characters develop over the movie is awesome. There are twists one after another and the movie keeps you focused every single minute.

The emotions range from anger to delight and from being touched to being sad. It's amazing how interesting can movie can be within prison environments.

Movie also makes you think, that is it really necessary and rational to have lifetime sentences or sentences which last for decades for so many people. With such time vast majority of people can change completely. And how to pay attention for those who are released from prison, so that they have a chance to get back to right track.

So in addition to being excellent movie, it makes you think many important questions and makes you see that there are many nice people with interesting lives also in jails, some even being innocent.",9
"This movie is without a doubt is one of the most brilliant films. It encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it gives hope in a dark place like prison there can be love,fun, happiness, kindness and hope...It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.Frank Darabont directed only 2 movies and both of them were amazing. What more can be said about this film? Pulp Fiction and Forest Gump were released in the same year and I would still choose this movie over the other 2. Can't believe this movie didn't take home any Oscar. It's absolutely brilliant and captures the mind with its simplicity. Hollywood doesn't make them like this anymore.",10
"Just watch the movie. I don't care what kind of movies you might typically be a fan of because this one carries true meaning. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at their best. If you are ever feeling down, then pop this in the player because it helps. I just love this movie. I only hope I can look forward to a movie in the future that will touch me the way this one has!

See it! I promise you won't regret it.",10
A must watch. This film really hits home. It's amazing so much can be fit into such a short film. Hanks is amazing. Delivering an amazing performance that does not disappoint. No matter how many times I watch this it has the same affect. I would not recommend for young children. A real hit. Will always be remembered. A movie you can watch 1000 times. If you enjoy this movie you will also enjoy castaway as well as many other movies that Hanks is in. It is a shame that some of the cast of actors has passed away. I hope you will enjoy this film as much as I did and it will make a positive impact on your life. There are few great films and this happens to be one.,9
"It was a movie like a novel. As we know, it's an adaptation of a short story by Stephen King, and it also feels like reading a classic book. Morgan Freeman is a very good story teller. I would also congratulate Frank Darabont for giving the audience such intense emotions and creating a legend for everyone.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an instant classic by far.This is probably one of the most greatest movies of all time.Tim Robbins did the role tremendously.Morgan Freeman made the movie what it is today.I love this movie.Im telling you if you haven't seen this movie watch it right now.you will fall in love with the movie.The first time i saw this movie it almost brought tears to my eyes.The director Frank Darabont is a genius for this movie and we also have to thank Stephan King for writing the book.Both of those guys are amazing.please if you haven't seen the movie watch it, it will blow your mind.those who have seen this movie don't you agree with me?? This movie is great.",10

"After watching this movie I couldn't find a specific word to describe what I was feeling and what I was thinking, the closest word that I could get was 'amazed'. Every scene of the movie brings up one different feeling, and I think that this is why I liked this movie this much. The dialogs, the actors, the scenario, everything on this movie goes directly to your mind in such a way that it makes you feel tied to the movie and you just can't stop watching it. All the aspects of the movie are great, and that is what makes the movie even better. When I watched this movie, I was paying attention to the screenplay, and in the end of the movie I was delighted with the screenplay. The writer did such an amazing job and built this awesome and unique story about prison. I strongly encourage you to watch this movie because its very hard to get the entire picture of the movie by only reading this review.",10
The Best movie i have ever seen. I love this movie so much.,10
"Great movie! I am so picky in movies and so hard to find good movie nowadays. But The Shawshank Redemption one of the best Movies I've Ever Seen! The Ideas the Actors all in all perfect. They told me about it many years ago, you should watch it and I kept postponed it till one Friday I said I have to spare 2 and half hours to watch then voilà! Glad I've watched it.",10
"Hey there, I must tell you I just saw the movie and it's been out like eight years or so ...Great movie even now in the 21st century. I'm sure it'll still be great many years from now, such as ""Gone with the wind""- another classic. I'll sure be seeing it again and then some. I'm not gonna spoil it because I'm sure by now you've seen it or if not someone has already given you or you've read the synopsis. However, just trust me in my words, "" Don't rent the movie, BUY IT! It's that Good!!!!"" Well, take care and look no further this is the last advice you need :-) go see it, your ""hopes"" will come true!...",10
"Woooow this movie the best for me The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.

The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.

But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while",10
"What can I say...Flawless, spectacular, wonderful, brilliant, great, classic, wondrous, an achievment beyond words! This movie, is without a doubt wonderful. I remember seeing only a few moments of it on TV, when I was twelve. I rented it, and found myself ASTOUNDED by the magnitude of its emotion. I didn't cry, but I felt as though someone had pierced my heart with an arrow. It felt good!!! I have never seen anything in my life so affecting. This is my favorite film ever! Nothing will ever beat this as my number one. I love Citizen Kane, and I think it is ""the best film ever made"" on a critical standpoint, But I love this just a little bit more. Cinematography, music, writing, directing, acting. EVERYTHING PERFECT! It is spectacular. I will never forget ""The Shawshank Redemption"".",10
"The movie was absolute trash. Horrible scripts, least menacing villain ever, no chemistry between the actors, and mundane story line. The movie was immensely over hyped and definitely does not deserve anything near a 9.3 rating. Its alright as a kids movie. It does not come anywhere near the unprecedented standards set by the dark knight or for that matter does not even come close to spiderman 2. The movie is often commended for its humor. In my opinion the humor is extremely dry and futile. Nothing special at all, despite its box office success it would have been better off as an animated movie. So if you want watch at least a decent super hero flick you might as well pick up Watchmen, X-men first class, Spider man 1 or 2 and of course the batman trilogy.",10
I very good movie i saw ones. Is not the best movie but is ok can bee whatch again,9
"Beautifully shot, lovingly portrayed by Tim Robins, Morgan Freeman, et al., written and directed with aplomb from beginning to end.

That Shawshank didn't win any Oscars but tops just about every list of best movies ever is an injustice bordering on a travesty.",10
Such a great film. On so many levels. It's a must-see!,7
"This film deserves to be at the top,of the list. Career defining roles for Robbins and Freeman. Sometimes the movies that stand the test of time won't win the biggest awards but gain the loyalty of fans for generations. This will be one of them.",10
This is one of the best movie of all time! Don't waste any more time and go watch it Now!,10
"""Hope is a good thing probably best of all & good thing never dies."" This line from this movie shows the actual truth what humanity need most . "" The Shawshank redemption "" is based upon legendary stephen king's novel which represents very truth of life never lose hope because it probably best of all . Great direction by frank darabondt , impeccable script , screenplay , towering performances by cast made this movie greatest movie ever made . Duffrian's relentless effort to get away from prison life stands him alone from others , life in prison is totally different one just have to confront his /her fear trauma , one has to tackle with them else life will be nothing less than hell , also keep your mind busy as mind itself can be most troubled thing in prison life if it remained unattended . Casting is another great thing about this movie , characters of Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman have been crafted by director so perfectly that they have become great source of inspiration for all. I personally belive this movie is life learning lesson , everyone must need to watch this movie and understand how difficult traumatic life could be ,one of the the scene where one of the inmate committed suicide when he was released from prison and allowed to live a common man life as it was tough for him to adjust with society like he has become accustomed to prison life , that harrowing reality will shock you how traumatic life could be . This great movie is absolutely an evershing gem of world cinema . Don't miss this great movie it's a life time experience of a kind you won't ever forget.",7
"Voted the best movie of all time, and I couldn't agree more. The film is a masterpiece and can be rewatched a 1000 times over. Thank you to all those who created this film.",10
"If you are open-minded, patient (possibly emotional or even compassionate) you will be happy by the time you finish this movie. If you like films like 'Schindler's List' or 'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest', then you will love this films progression and style.

It has some of the very best acting you will see, the plot is superb (wont go into it here) and all sub-plots play out well with the overall movie tying up rather nicely. You'll most definitely be rooting for our guys:- Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) & Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), two of the finest performances you'll see. Due respect also goes to the support, Bob Gunton, William Sadler & Clancy Brown with a great early role from Gil Bellows (Ally McBeal).

Outstanding directing, impeccable timing and excellent photography and the music was very chilling and uplifting, whichever was required. One small let down IMHO was the running time of 2h 22m which becomes noticeable during its final moments but the film itself is generally tight, the cast & crew did a great job here.

9/10",10
"it is, if not, the greatest movie i have ever seen. it is inspiring, a tribute to the great acting skills of morgan freeman and tim robbins. there are maybe two or three movies i would give a 10 to, and this is one of them. if you have never seen it before, you should watch it. movies like these are rare.",9
I really liked this movie specially the ending was so satisficing but I would like to say that in my opinion I would be way better if the didn't include the valance and r*pe part in the movie.,10
"There aren't many films that have as much of an emotional pull on you than the Shawshank Redemption does. Emotions flood through and through as you watch this movie. One second it's sadness the next it's a feeling of optimism and hope. A movie which solely takes place in a prison is one of the most inspiring pieces of art to ever be released. A film which features a brilliant screenplay by Frank Darabont, astonishing performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, an amazing score by Thomas Newman, delightful cinematography and camera work, and a film featuring some of the greatest and inspiring themes ever seen in a film. One of the only films to ever bring me to tears, this beautiful film will stay with you forever and leave you thinking of life, and the possibility of wondrous things to come.",10
"It is one of the best movie I have ever watched. This movie is based on the real story I guess. It shows a talented person. His passion and love for freedom. His friends salute him very much. Really the must watch movie. Will you be the same, if I saw you in heaven. No words more than this. I guess the movie may help the depressed guys to once again live up their life.",10
"This is the most enjoyable movie ever made. With many one liners that can fill ones life with hope.This movie came out the same year that Pulp Fiction and Forrest Junk came out, the only reason this was not a Best Picture winner. Vote 10 if you can.",8
Why is this movie only first-runner-up? This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever created! All I'm saying is GET BUSY LIVING OR GET BUSY DYING... Thumbs up!,10
"I really wish that I had never seen this film as I have wasted so much of my time in front of the tv watching this wonderfull film. I must have seen it about 100 times, and bought the video or DVD 5 times for myself and friends.

Well done to Frank Darrabont for making an excellent film from a very small book, I can hardly believe that 2+ hours of my life have gone so quickly. (As they say time flies when your enjoying yourself! )",10
This movie leave me feeling refreshed...i loved the dramatic depiction of hope and friendship,10
"I dont know from where to start talkin about this movie.. i saw this movie around 4yrs bak. i have never been so involved in a movie before.. this totally took me by surprise .. everything about this movie be it the performance of the actors.. the story telling is excellent.. the situation of the prison life being shown really touches you.. and the climax was more than an icing on the cake.. its background score is just awesome.. esp the part of ""brooks was here "" i cant get enuff of that piece of music.. all in it easily comes as the best movie i have eva seen.. and one thing i usually do is make other people also watch this masterpiece.. its brilliant..",10
"A man who was in the midst of Deception; deciding to follow it in, and with using another sin. He began to sober up, but he was too late, he turned and caught the justice of the two lovers fate. He found himself locked with in. Finding foes and friend, that sums it up for corruption. He was placed in the Dark, seeing glimpses of the light. Only to feel the need to escape his plight. He kept real cool, as far as everyone knew, but underneath his skin, a hole began to cave in. When all was said and done, his salvation laid just behind another women. Out of the tunnel in his mind, and through the muck, he was baptized. This was the man we called Andy, who ended his journey keeping the chess board ready. Seeing his new found friend, walking toward him in the sand. As he had just escaped, using the words ""I don't give a Damn"".",9
"It's sad it's uplifting. It's right it's wrong. but most of all it's the greatest film of our time and everyone should have this in their collection. Everything from the heartache that tim robbins character faced to the power of friendship with one mans struggle agains a wall of oppression he made his path to the top and he fool them all. This is with out a doubt the greatest thing I have ever watched and I feel that everyone should know about it and watch it at least 20 times, for there are some valuable lessons to be learnt but dont take my word for it go there and see for yourself. This film set the marker for what prision films aspire to. These guys should be knighted and given the key to the world never mind the city.",8
"Usually the movies/films are NEVER as good as the BOOKS! Whether novel, novella and or short story.. Yet ""THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION"" shatters that ideology. From the writing of the script, production, the casting, directing, cinematography to every ""drop"" of acting, leached, extracted most exquisitely much like the vinification of cultured grapes to a fine wine. The actors fully embody their characters until the characters are not there but the people the viewer watches as their individual lives are played out before us.

This is a movie that draws you in by your very heart and soul and ""places"" you there.. You ""breath"" this film. ""You"" feel this film. And once a person with a sense of life and empathy has seen ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it resonates with you just like the first time one sees the ocean or the mountains.

For the average every day person who doubts life can change so drastically in the brief moment it takes one to exhale.. To the true film connoisseur this film.. Much like the oceans and the mountains.. Should never be left.. ~unperceived..

THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF WHOLE CINEMAS HISTORY,10
This movie is my numbe 1 movie of all the time. It is filmed so good and the story lines up perfect. This is all time classic. I recommend this movie to everyone that havent seen in yet.,5
"this is a must see in my opinion, a truly timeless film. One of my favorites of all time. This film is what started my deep respect for Morgan Freeman as not only an actor but a narrator. You are doing yourself a serious disservice by not seeing the Shawshank Redemption. trust me, watch it all the way through, right now, I've never heard anyone say they didn't like this film.

I don't want to say anything about it because i don't want to ruin it, see it for your self.

now.

right now.",10
I got lost for words. Strongly recommend this movie,9
"Firstly, as you probably know, this film is great! There's no two ways about it, this film is great and always will be for many decades to come.

The casting is perfect and the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are just brilliant. The film also has a message which all viewers will relate to in one way or another and the last half an hour is probably the best period in the film.

However, the plot of Shawshank is entirely predictable and the movie is way too long with periods where absolutely nothing is happening.

All in all, Shawshank Redemption is a great film, if not the best of the last century. It has many things going for a bit but is let down by a few dull scenes and a predictable story line.",10
"Shawshank Redemption Is as Perfect as a Film Can Get This film has everything , Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) Has played His ace in his acting life With this film He plays his part so close to perfect it hurts , Morgan Freeman (Red) also played a massive part in the film and his acting at times was amazing together with tim robbins they made the film as good as it was, but even Bob Gunton (Warden Samuel Norton) played a superb ruthless warden Together with Clancy Brown (Capt. Byron Hadley) They made acting seem so easy and it was joy to watch them , also this movie had u thinking whats gonna happen next will he or wont he. It Was just one them movies that was always destined to be massive Hit with many great quotes and smooth as u can get storyline with an amazing twist to the plot that will catch u off gaurd anyone who has not seen this sould watch it soon as possible to see how films sould be made 10/10

Fear Can Hold U Prisoner. Hope Can Set U Free.",9
"Everyone should watch this movie. Profoundly moving and very emotional. Amazing acting. A great watch, a true 10",10
"In a life time, at least once, you must watch this fantastic movie. I really liked it to my heart. I was so impressed with how every single scene was given a great deal of respect and attention from the ace director. The movie has a great and deep message that everyone should take it as positive in our lives",9
"The movie features friendship and the bond created between two strangers who have never met each other before. How they feel comfort in a place like Shawshank which I can say is a Hell in real life. Kudos to the directors and actors for such a lovely masterpiece and a must watch for all movie lovers. Even those jaded film fans will love ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. The movie will make you emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important and you will realize it once you have watched this one. A strong recommendation.

MJ",10
"I never intended to ever watch this movie. A girlfriend of mine told me ""you'll love it."" And after I finished watching it I was stunned. No movie other than ""The Accidental Tourist"" has had such an influence on my life. This movie is about hope and it shows you that it can never be lost. It also shows you that the weakest looking people may actually be the strongest. The thing about Shawshank Redemption is even if you hate dramas you'll appreciate this movie nevertheless. This movie stopped me from being an action genre junkie and turned me into a connoisseur of great movies. Even though there is no science-fiction in this movie you'll still feel that its magical. However, the first time you view it will be the best. Go see it.......it'll make your day brighter!",10

"Easily the greatest movie ever and perhaps a little bias in my review. The length perfect, building the characters is perfection without taking it too far. The direction again perfect. Of course they nailed the narration. But honestly this is a movie I can watch again and again it's timeless even now in 2021.",10
BEST MOVIE EVER YOU GOING TO WATCH SPECIALLY ABOUT THE STORY,10
"This is an masterpiece. A very intense and thrilling movie which aged well.

After I bought it in the DVD-Palace and watched from my couch, I recommended it to many people living in my street.

It was fabulous!",9
"The Shawshank Redemption was a film that I have heard so much about. Many of my friends have hailed it as their favorite film and one of the greatest films ever made. Now, being someone who isn't easily pleased; I went into The Shawshank Redemption with reservations.

Coming out of the film, I realized that it made me feel warm. I know that's a weird saying but it's a comfort film. A lot of people love it because it leaves you feeling happy and hopeful; not disturbed like Chinatown or frightened like Halloween (1978).

Shawshank is sentimental, joyful and has one great ending. Yet, the film feels so ""safe""; leading the audience to a bittersweet and somewhat forced conclusion.

Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a good film; it just doesn't take risks. Shawshank feels just fine in its little comfortable cinematic world.

If people enjoy that type of film, that's fine; I just think a film that takes more risks (2001: A Space Odyssey or The Tree Of Life) should be deserving of the top spot of the IMDb Top 250.",10
"This movie about time, patience and loyalty of two persons, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends.

At first I did not believe that this movie is very good but when I saw it I was without words. Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins did a great job by moving the story smoothly. One of the best movies.",10
Overhyped socialist movie that tried to convince me that prisoners are better people then us and deserve much better treatment.,10
"Every so often, a certain type of movie comes along that deeply moves anyone who watches it. This movie is grand in scope and scale, its character portrayals so moving and so real, that you cannot help becoming completely engrossed by it. I believe that the Shawshank Redemption is one of these movies. Often times, movies based on books are sub par, with the common complaint being, ""The book is better."" Well I, for one, have read the book and watched the movie, and I assure you that the movie is not a let down at all, but rather a triumph of modern cinema. The Shawshank Redemption saw career-defining performances from many of its cast members,including Tim Robbins, who became a top star after his incredible performance, and Morgan Freeman, who added to his already impressive list of accolades with his perfect supporting role. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker who is unjustly convicted of killing his wife and her lover after he discovers that she is having an affair. Andy is a true outsider in the bleak world of Shawshank prison, an educated man not used to violence and despair that are an everyday part of prison life.",10
The plot is so good. Everyone should watch it. Morgan's character is one of the best ever.,10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" has a hype so high that it is unfair to the film and its potential viewers. But it is an expertly written ocean of what a movie should be, and how a movie should capture such emotions from the audience, and how an audience will realize it is not glorified, but a masterpiece that is sure followed by almost any filmmaker by the slightest of touches. In this single film, it contains all of the basics (humor, drama, dread and redemption), but it tacks on much more. From the depths of its characters to Andy's shoes. It is about freedom, friendship and those metaphorical shackles. It's final scene could have not been so touching in a lesser movie, but it all pans out. Pans out in ways we hoped. In ways we dreamed.",10
What good can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already if you're in the mood for a good long movie and a happy ending then this is it.,10
"The short novel by Stephen King has been adapted by Owen O'Neill and Dave Johns and is likely to prove popular with fans of the film as well as those who are too young to remember the original format. Based on the 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption, the play examines desperation, injustice, friendship and hope behind the bars of a maximum security facility. The 1994 feature film, regularly voted Britain's favourite ever movie, starred Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Two of TV's best loved leading men, Ian Kelsey (Doctors, Casualty and Emmerdale) and Patrick Robinson (Casualty, Midsomer Murders), star in this new production of The Shawshank Redemption, which is running at Milton Keynes Theatre until Saturday. Despite protests of his innocence, Andy Dufresne is handed a double life sentence for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover. Incarcerated at the notorious Shawshank facility, he quickly learns that no one can survive alone. Andy strikes up an unlikely friendship with the prison fixer Red, and things take a slight turn for the better. However, when Warden Stammas decides to bully Andy into subservience and exploit his talents for accountancy, a desperate plan is quietly hatched. A minimalist set is the perfect backdrop as the story unfolds in the confines of the prison walls. Dim lighting with the sound of doors slamming and keys turning makes you feel as though you were inside the 'Shank' with the inmates. The onstage partnership of Kelsey and Robinson has a genuine warmth to it, and this is complimented by their co-stars who bring both light and shade to the performance. No one can miss the distinctive laugh of Rooster, wonderfully but hauntingly captured by Leigh Jones, and Ian Barritt as Brooksie and George Evans as Tommy Williams shine in their 'darkest' moments. Owen O'Neill is perfect for the role of Warden Stammas, chillingly bringing a sense of fear to the stage every time he features. With the film's cult status, some die-hard fans may not like the fast-pace of the stage adaptation, which takes you through the years inside at a much quicker pace than the original film. But there is no harm in breathing new life into a classic and if you loved the film, why not indulge yourself in re-living it in a new format. The show contains strong language and adult content and is recommended for people aged 15 and over.",10
"This movie has it all. The screenplay, direction and dialogue are all first class. No movie comes near it. The speeches, Morgan Freeman's acting...my oh my, just brilliant, absolutely brilliant. The movie shows how crucial it is for us human beings to live in a world of hope, and not in fear. As he says in the movie, ""...so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, some things are best left unsaid""...that line is very true of this masterpiece. I will say no more, but just bow down to possibly the GREATEST movie that there was, there is, and there ever will be!",10
"One of the most amazing films I have ever watched, script photography everything. You will not be dissapointed. Loved it!",10
"The fact that this film was reviewed by many users and still many more are going to states that this movie is a true classic. You have to say only few movies can make you store them for life and relive and enjoy the moments like you are seeing them for the first time.

I enjoyed the characters very real and we may not see them everyday but we still get a feeling of knowing from eternity. Director used all the film making techniques to good use and let us be the eye rather than a stranger.

The writing is flawless and inspiring. The eternal satisfaction that makes us feel fulfilled at the end of the movie is priceless. I hope if ever I make movies in real, to make such a human movie.

Bravo to the team.",10
"To me, this will be and stay a masterpiece. The acting is phenomenal and the camera angles and suspense buildup is priceless.",9
"motivational? yes definitely..

A great movie to let out all your inner sorrows. its just more than what a movie can offer you. a movie which is suitable and a must watch for all. the dialogues are perfectly written that it reflects for everyone watching it, at least at some point in their life. the performances are top notch that one gets immersed into the movie as if you are a part of it and they are right in front of you. kudos to tim robbins and morgan freeman, they lift up the soul of the movie with their tremendous performances.the soundtrack is so well crafted that it'll be in ones mind for a long time. it can surely make a great impact in one's life and definitely worth a watch. no wonder its among the top favorites to most movie lovers. its rightly deserving and voted. please give it a watch if one haven't yet.",7
"Well maybe its WHY soap operas last a long time...because there is a HUGE market for them, that is why this movie has 9 stars don't get me wrong its a fine movie, but #1 not a chance.

I suggest u expand your horizons with European and Asian movies or good classic us movies, cultivate yourself a little.

By the way Morgan freeman is badly directed at times overacted

Good script but then again is designed to emotionally impress you not to transcend you

Good for housewives and newbies with very little repertoire in film watching

I guess its expected",9
"The Shawshenk Redenption is best movie i ever seen in this category.You can watch great acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I think Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins makes they best in this film. Congragulations for the writer because it's a Great story. Maybe it's simple but very strong and attractive scenario.İn the scenario the surprises make the film better.. İ would like to thanks all the person who worked for this fantastic movie. The story takes you from the beginning and you are putting your self into the Tim Robbins.Simple and strong. I will watch again with my family. İt show you, there is no need only computer tricks for make good movies",10
"What to say about this movie, a true masterpiece and a well deserved 1st place here in IMDb. So many feelings felt while watching it. I could definitely watch it again and again and would have the same reactions. As someone said in another review: Excellent acting, soundtrack, photography, etc. Tim Robbins was the perfect guy for the role and all the other actors did great too. Do buy this movie because you not only will be able to enjoy it but you will learn a lot from your own reflections on various aspects of life and will be glad that you are free. The movie itself has a strong message with much impact. Don't miss it by any chance, there's a limited number of movies that will make you feel this emotional about being free and alive.",10
"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",8
"For me, ""the best ever"". Everything is simply amazing. Its relevant and appropriate even after 24 years of its release. You just love it. Go for it. Shawshank is waiting for you :).",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent work, in which the drama takes place in a calm, striking and surprising. Frank Darabont is the ideal person to adapt the works of Stephen King, manages to tell this heartwarming and inspirational story, conveying the hope of freedom and happiness together for the spectator. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, two superb actors, who once again showed their worth with this excellent performance. The soundtrack by Thomas Newman is magnificent. The end of the film, the way it is prepared, will surprise anyone who assists and dazzle with boldness and simplicity of this magnificent drama.",10
"A social misfit by nature,Andy on the outside of Shawshank prison was kind of a classic loner.But with Red,he fit right in at Shawshank.Breaks rules with few of his good friends.Never hurt nobody and quite in fact help everybody in the prison including the corrupt warden.His love for music is just majestic.And so there was,Andy Dufresne ended up in Shawshank Prison for a crime he did not commit and the Warden wants to keep him there for life.Inside those walls,people changes and it's funny as Red describes.At first,just after you got in,you want to be outside.But as you move on,they were growing on them.Brooks,who spent more than 50 years inside those walls,when he got out,he saw the world changed from when he got inside.So many changes that he felt leaving this world would be easier than to live in a world you don't understand.But hope is a very good thing.",9
"This is one of my all time favorites! With Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, you cannot go wrong! It's like everything is just perfect.

I really appreciated every moment of this piece of art! If you're into prison movies, well this is for sure the best around!

Every fan of Morgan Freeman should get this one, it's probably his best movie as of now along with Sev7n.

The kinda movie you would watch over and over and never get bored of it.

Buy this one, it's really worth the money!

This one gets,

an easy 10!",10
"The movie is fine and delicate with an intriguing story.

I would say that it falls within the top 50 best movies ever.

The story flows on and never gets boring.

It is a film you can see how many times.

You will be surprised all the time with ingenious scenes.

The acting is world class.

The environment and the photo is amazing.

One of the top 3 best prison movies.

Fun and exciting sad at the same time.

A real classic movie and if you have not seen it yet, I can only congratulate you on something beautiful you have to look forward to.",10
"I watched it first as a 13 year old and somehow back then at that age was able to comprehend how powerful and meaningful this movie is. Now at 37, I still smile and my heart still aches when I watch the last minute of this terrific film.

It's my favorite film. Was my father's as well. I watch it at least once every 5 or so years and despite knowing its every beat, I still love it as much now as I did when I first watched it.

It timeless. There's just something about it. Friendship, hope, and never give up. In other words, get busy living. That's what it wants to say and succeeds in doing so.",10
"This movie is a must watch because of directing, acting and an excellent script. Morgan Freeman is the star of the movie. He played the best role of his professional life in Shawshank redemption.",10
"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.",10
"this is the movie of satisfaction, must watch film

''The Shawshank Redemption'' is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story. The story is excellent,the time has just flew with this movie. This movie just gets better with every showing. There's no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Everyone must watch this movie.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",5
"One of my early experiences with a non supernatural Stephen King movie/Short Story. A Great prison movie with a full ensemble top line cast and every character had something.

With each point of the film was waiting to see who was going to be around until the end. It was a departure to see a King story without beasts or ghosts in it. And how a lot of the characters were developed throughout the film.

And the last moments of the film which I will need to see again, to check things out for myself and to speculate if I missed those details myself.",10
"From any point of view and from any point of view we want to examine this movie, it still deserves the first place of the best movie in the list of the best. The film has a universal narrative for all sections of society and all countries, perhaps it should be said that this narrative and story is based on humanity and a psychological and sociological perspective based on human emotions and thoughts. Which can attract the attention of any audience, on the other hand, it has an emotional and challenging story line for the protagonist, which will create a sense of kinship and catharsis in the audience. I invite you, Babak bigvand, as an audience and as a cinema director, to definitely watch this movie. We wish the best for you .",10
"This movie is one of a kind, it gives an experience that can never be predicted in the beginning or in the middle and the ending is a total roller-coaster ride.",8
This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. A classic.,10
"The best so far I watched this movie when I was a kid and still the best for me The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.

But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.

Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.

one of the greatest :)",10
Best movie for slow revenge.how andi to revenge was savage it inspire in many other way like have patience and work smart.so keep calm and let your action speak for yourself..,10
"Couldnt stand it. It's a decent film but not the best one ever, for sure.",10

"The Shawshank Redemption is actually a very good movie what I had seen two pass. This good movie is about hope, which is a very importance thing in our life.

But only Andy knows that he didn't commit the crimes. The prison is really black. Andy does not lose his heart about his life and he can quickly adapt to prison life.

"It has been a pretty long time since i have seen such a great movie , great actors and great play of roles. Watching this movie made me realize a little evolution on movies spirit,knowing that lately film companies are trying to put technology first. In general , the movie managed to build a very strong emotional link between characters in the film , and apparently , that link is strong enough to make us feel for them and share feelings with the cast.I simply love everything about this movie, beginning from Andy's first day in prison , to his last day locked.I was impressed with the details ,they were perfectly handled,(per say) like the time when Andy tried to hit the pipes on the same time with the storm so the guards would not hear him trying to escape. Those little things matter a lot. I gave it a 10 and enjoyed watching it. Simply beautiful.",10
From opening scene.. to the very last scene this movie is phenomenal.,9
"The caption basically shows you my opinion of that movie. It is a top film with a great storyline and perfectly described characters who are performed by actors knowing their craft well. Furthermore I also praise Darabont for turning King's short story into an almost 3-hour long drama without losing the basic message of the book and its atmosphere. Namely how different the two main characters are who represent a certain life philosophy : Red is the pessimistic one who never raises hope because life taught him that there is none but Andy is the total opposite: He never loses his hope even in such a terrible place. Nevertheless it is definitively NOT the best film of all time! Come on my fellow IMDb voters, how can you deliberately ignore the other movie masterpieces?! It is the without doubt the best prison movie (The Green Mile?!) and also one of the best book-adaption but there a better movies...admit it!!",9
"Freedom and brave ¡°Birds need air, human need freedom! ¡° If you lose freedom in your life, you imagine what you can do? Maybe your world is grey; you can¡¯t control your behavior. That is too awful and miserable!

Andy is a good sample, he is a young and clever banker, and he was sentenced because he killed his wife, but he did not do that in fact, he have to stay at the boring prison at last. The truth is so cruel! Andy is brave person, I admired him very much.

He did a good job for the minister of prison nearly twenty years, with a place mood and tastiest. This is not easy. Under this badly environment, how can keep a place mood? Maybe most of people can not do that.

Andy had a great plan when he came into the prison. He did not plan to stay here in all his life. He must war with his freedom. He dipped a long road about 500 yards. The road stands for his freedom and hope. Rod is his good friend, and helps him a lot.

Shawshank Redemption is a good film. I got a lot from it. First, everyone is free, don¡¯t be controlled by others, you have your ideas and behavior. Second, don¡¯t give up your courage; face the truth with your braveness. No one can help you, but yourself. Third, if you want to succeed, the courage, strengthen tastiest and place mood.",10
"Without the hope and freedom, what should we do? The hero of the film is not a weak man as we image, he is a successor because he save himself.

The Shaw shank Redemption is an old story .The young banker -Andy was undeserved, but was sentenced. In the long and hopeless time, people in the prison, not only to confront the wretched environment and the execrable turkey, but also to be controlled by the institution and to be hurt by the sore feeling. ¡°These walls are kind of funny like that: first you hate them, then you get used to them. Enough time pass, get so you depend on them."" The institution was deathly; did you have enough courage to suspect it? As the miserable old librarian in the film, he lived in prison for most of his life, he adapted the life of prison, and so he can't live without the acquaintance and familiar environment. What he only can do was to make him evaporated in the world, which did not, belong to him.

But, for those execrable environments, Andy was a strong man although he looks gentle and weak .He did his work on his own way and kept the freedom in his mind. First, he learn to tough in the wretched environment, and then he became a hard-bitten person. Secondly, he also has the good friendship with his friends. Then they can help each other. Third, he can toady the person who can give him rights to prepare to flee for his life. Fourth, he caught opportunities for his life and believed every dog has his own day. Then did many things to prepare for the plan .19 years passed, with the freedom in his mind; he got his new life outside of the prison at last. The freedom belongs to him.

From the film, I understand the truth: In the walleyed floor of despair, where is God? Everyone is God for oneself. If you give up yourself, no one can help you. But if you save yourself, the hope and freedom will belong to you one day!",10
"Up there with the best films of all time, great story line, great twist, great film from start to finish!

The storyline takes you through the prison life of intelligent banker Andrew Dufresne who even though the crime he has been detained for he did not commit, remains quiet and takes the life sentence on the chin.

Throughout the film he encounters many characters, some who take a liking to him for the right reasons, and some for the wrong reasons. But what Andrew is plotting in secret will shock the entire Shawshank prison, and indeed the audience.

With twists and turns at every corner, ups and downs and emotional drama, Shawshank is undoubtedly one of the best film ever made.",10
This movie is one of the most heartfelt I've seen in a long time . Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins friendship was built upon trials & tribulations in a corrupted prison system where justice had no place to exist. This was definitely a divine connection in the most unorthodox way.,10
"Perhaps the best movie ever shot, as evidenced by its rating of #3 on IMDb's top 250 list. This movie is so good, my words will do it little justice, but alas, I will try. The music: perfect. The actors: Morgan Freeman in his best role, in a word perfect. The pacing: its long, but this accurately portrays the idea of time in prison. The theme: wonderful, and inspiring at every viewing. If you have not seen this movie, you must. You will not regret it. The ""Shawshank Redemption"" is the most overlooked movie in history... this movie should have won a number of Oscars, among other awards. It is just that good. Go rent it, buy it, borrow it, whatever, just see it!",10
"Everyone who has watched ¡° Shaw shank redemption¡± knows that Andy was undeserved to be in prison. If it were you what would you do? Snarl? Complain the unfair society? I will probably get suicide for the innocence. For I am not strong enough and there is not so much power to support me to go on my life with such heavy burden. After sentenced to prison Andy was silent. However there was an under set hidden in Andy¡¯s heart while he looked quiet. ¡°Get busy living, or get busy dying¡± reminds me a saying by famous Chinese writer Lu Sun. That is ¡°break out in silence or perdition in silence¡±.

There is another set of dialogue that is impressive. Red: ¡°Hope is a dangerous thing¡± but Andy said: ¡°Hope is a good thing.¡± His escaping is the strongest evidence. Andy got a hope for which he can be busy. No other than this conviction set him free once more. Andy is a bird with beautiful feather and it is sin to forbid him in prison. Escaping is predetermined. Miracle is coming true by Andy¡¯s Rock-hammer.

In the film, dialogue between Andy and Red and Red¡¯s monologue described vivid interpersonal activity. And this peaceful talking may stimulate readers¡¯ inner billows better than exciting dialogue. Andy¡¯s guilt to his wife has been released and got redemption after locking in Shaw shank prison for nigh teen years. The heaviest burden of a person in one¡¯s lifetime is from inside rather than outside. Lots of lines in the film are valuable for us to take our time to taste it. And everyone shall remember that hope is a good thing.",10
"Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that ¡° hope¡± is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning.

Most people who see this movie for the first time are not going to appreciate it completely, I feel that it is quite possible the best movie ever made. Some may be more entertaining, like say Indian Jones and the last Crusade, but none as compelling. The movie shows a world of different emotions, mainly through its two main characters, Red and Andy. The acting is incredible. The message is stronger than that of most any movie, and is stated very clearly. ¡° Hope¡± is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever does.¡± After being drained by the sad events that occur in the movie, the ending uplifts, and thoroughly fulfills the gap that it could leave you with.

I believe that one reason that this movie is under appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. At first viewing it is the story of Andy and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find different path of freedom that is lit by hope.

No matter what circumstances you live in, do not forget that hope is the best thing in the world. And you will have courage to struggle, to forward, and to live better in the world.",10
"First let me say that usually I'm not much into drama. But the beauty of The Shawshank Redemption forced me into watching the whole film four times over the years.

It's the kind of movie that is so powerful and realistic you become glued to your seat until the end. The twist at the end gave the movie a perfect finish without affecting the fine gist of the whole movie. Shawshank Redemption teaches us, improves our feelings about the world and changes our expectations about 'luck'. It shows us what a movie can do.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver their best performance ever. It did not sweep the board at the Academy Awards, but that was because of Tom Hank's movie Forrest Gump",10
They just don't make movies like these now-a-days.,10

"Surprising to know why this movie just had Oscar nominations but did not receive an award!! Of course, it came along with other all time greats like Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, this movie should have still swept the Oscars. This should recieve the Oscar for ""Greatest Movie of All time"". Watching this movie will keep you thinking about life and thoroughly life changing with marvellous philosophies about Hope and what it can do to a person. No surprises this is on top of the IMDB list.",10
"I have never heard about this movie in fact and it was very surprising to see such 'not known' movie at top of the list and that too above GODFATHERS. For me this was the only reason to watch Shawshank Redemption initially but now it is my favorite 'watch again and again' movie. Reasons ? Well . (1) Simple but outstanding Storyline with so many twists and turns. (2) All twists and turns are natural and logical. You find them somewhere near to you but fail to detect till they are revealed on the screen. This is one of the most interesting feature of this movie. (3) Direction is per excellence as may be expected from any great movie. (4) Characters and Acting: Outstanding. (5) Narration by Morgan Freeman. (6) Music: suffice to mention the harmonica played when Red approaches the oak tree he was searching for. (7) One of the most loving ending that leaves you in a state of virtual ecstasy. You leave the screen smiling from within. In fact all great movies contains the features I have mentioned above but what distinguishes Shawshank Redemption from other great movies, in my view, and what makes it most deserving for No. 1 spot, is, undoubtedly, the last 20 minutes of the movie that is pure ecstasy that leads to the most satisfying ending.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is without a question one of the most brilliant movies I tally e'er seen. Siamese to The Immature Knot in more respects (and finer than it in most all of them), these two movies change shown us that Stephen Contender is a original not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the spunk. The strategy is mediocre, but Monarch did major things with it in his novel that are only furthered by the substance, and the acting is so top-rate it's near scary.

Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 period for the slaying of his mate. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Citizen, in probably his champion enactment) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively ugly and frightening as Warder Norton, and there are extraordinary performances and cameos all around; the most salient one existence Gil Bellows (new as Goat of Commonwealth McBeal) as Tommy, a feller inmate of Andy's who suffers under the robust instrument of Norton.

If you haven't seen this picture, GO AND Payoff IT NOW. You instrument not be frustrated. It is positively the top show of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all indication. This flick is a blunder to move the design, soul, and spirit. 10/10",10
"This is just my favorite movie of all time. I really wanted to do a review on it and here it is. GO-WATCH-THIS-MOVIE! Don't rent it. Buy it. This is such an amazing movie, it's on the best movies list for IMDb for a reason. It keeps you entertained and most of all, it is so emotional. Yes, it IS another jail movie but it's not like any else you'll ever see. And yes, there is a rape scene but it's a phenomenal movie and it will probably become your new favorite. I can't speak for everyone but it surely did become my new favorite. And I won't give away the ending on you but I can say it is about the best movie ending EVER. It's what officially made it my number 1. Anyway, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this movie. You NEED to see it and I rate this movie ten out of ten no doubt.",8
"So this guy really wanted to say when I pulled him out of the TMD and beat on TV , he did not know the truth. His mother does not know how much pain he suffered for , was how many crimes . He insists , clinging to his father 's death . Really, careful thought, we live in the world, most do not also have experienced this state duffers it? But compared to what it is we do not fix. I was easily into the drama of the people , so that it is possible that this actor ( I'm too lazy to check who he is ) this impression in my mind too deep , perhaps after several of his ministry let me get out to play this impression on him . But to be honest, played good.",10
"This movie inspires you every moment. In this, you not only get the inspiration to struggle, the courage to never give up, to deal with every situation, but also you get to see the hollow social system and the corrupt legal system. This movie must get the best rating, it definitely deserves.

People who really like to watch great movies, this movie is often found in the favorite list of those people.

You will get to see how circumstances start dominating you and how you can become a victim in the face of these circumstances without strong willpower. Also, having a strong will power, you can overcome even the worst of situations, you will also realize this after watching this film.",10
"Acting - best Story - awesome and complex Video quality - awesome considering the time being

Highly recommend it for anyone!",10
"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",10
Movie is Too long ... it does have an ok story & A good message but that is it.,10
"This movie absolutely tugs at every emotional string during it's powerful story line and triumph. This a must see and also a classic. Regardless of your personal preference and movie demographic, this movie will not disappoint. And of course Morgan Freeman in my opinion, is and always will be one of/is the greatest actor(s) of all time. I remember watching this as a child and even being moved but not necessarily understanding the basis of it. Now being older and watching it multiple times it never looses it's edge. And hopefully generations from now can enjoy it as I have. And I also own the VHS (Remember those? lol). And the Blu ray edition along with the DVD. Well enough rambling and I apologize, I just truly love this movie.",9
That movie you can see it ever and ever again to the rest of your life because you love every moment of him He deserve critically and commercial success every movie cannot reach that success for Thousand and Thousands we will be thankfully for the great writer in his best work he ever made and we will s till waiting for his next big thing every moment in this movie is important we would love to see that director again and again and he could be doing new with actors and writer once more that will be great and they will be blowing our mind this movie have one of the best movie ending and starting in the history of movies,10
"Best movie till date.If you are given a chance, that you can watch only one movie in your life ! this can easily be that one movie for lifetime. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely.The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director. Common life lessons, ones that everyone can relate strongly to. With so many of them seamlessly woven into a great plot, portrayed by a wonderful cast and told in an approachable form, it's not surprising that many like me consider this the most most complete movie till date.",10
"Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this movie a lot, but the hype around it and it being considered the best movie ever is a stretch. It is top 50 or something but definitely not the best. That being said it is still an amazing movie. Great plot, great acting, great writing and all around a great movie.",9
"If you haven't seen this movie I don't know what you've been doing...

A beautifully moving story of perseverance and friendship in the seemingly bleakest of scenarios.

A must watch for anyone and everyone.",9
"The first time that I saw this movie was in my film class last semester in college. The teacher was supposed to play Pulp Fiction and changed his mind at the last minute. Most of us we're not very happy and didn't want to see a 2+ hour film about a guy in prison. When the movie let out everybody literally cheered. Shawshank has the amazing ability that most films lack to grab our attentions and keep it for such a long length of time. It also has the ability to make out spirits soar unlike any other film. No matter how low you are, when you are done watching Shawshank you are ready to fly. Amazing acting, flawless directing and a perfect story make this film a must see for anybody who enjoys movies. A perfect 10!",9
The film is slow but the characters are well described and developed. Very interesting topic and a deep dive into the human psych,10
"While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.",10
"Dont get why is this greatest here, lol ok but i mean it is a movie after all",9
"One of my all time favourites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",4
It's a wonderful movie that shows the power of hope. It's pictured in a very nice way and deserves the 10/10 rating. It has a lasting effect on you and you'll think about the movie a lot of times after you've finished seeing it. I recommend everybody to watch it. Tim Robbins shows the limits to which a person can suffer and how he can bounce back with his brilliance and hope. Morgan Freeman gives a classy act and is very fit for the character. The direction is excellent and does justice to the amazing script. The other actors have also portrayed their characters brilliantly. You'll feel hatred towards the negative characters and that's only because of their amazing acting. This movie is top in the top 250 list of IMDb fr a reason. Have a nice watch. :),10
"I have just dished out what I would like to have been a minus out of ten (0/10) for After Earth.

I thought I would add balance.

Can you give a film 10/10? I have watched many movies in my 50 years of life.

I think if you read the plot etc you would not necessarily give Shawshank Redemption the highest marks. How misleading.

I have seen many very good movies. Some of them compete with Shawshank Redemption. May there be many more!

However, Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. It is obviously hard to choose from many very good films. Every time I watch Shawshank Redemption I sit back moved, entertained and anything else you would like from a film.

How I wish I had written for this movie. Directed it or had some involvement in it. I couldn't get better actors if I tried. I am just astounded.

Maybe Shawshank is not perfect. Nothing is. But as it is the best film I have ever seen it simply must get 10/10!",10
"This movie is not bad , but i think it's overrated because there is too many movies that are better than this one , it's not even the best one in 1994, as we have Satantango, Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump ! .. and its like i wanna go in the details more and more and the movie stayed not deep enough , so there is a lot of stories that deserves talking about it! ,, its not only about how to escape ! i don't want a movie like that ! ,, arts are better than fun , and if there is no art there is no fun ! so it doesn't deserve the first place in this list ! its overrated ! ,, and i hope from other users to watch a lot of movies so they can judge in equal way!",8
"First of all i want to start by saying that i am not the guy who would sit on his computer and write a review about anything. However i felt that ''The Shawshank Redemption'' was a movie that would leave,everyone,and i mean EVERYONE stunned.Amazing acting,deep drama,an excellent story and the feeling of that special something you cant forget sum it all up for this masterpiece.I highly recommend you see this movie which will leave a stigma in your mind.Mr. Morgan deserved the Oscar for this one but unfortunately it went to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump.Don't get me wrong,both movies were excellent but i think Shawshank is better overall.

Undoublty my all time favourite movie,regardless of genre!",10
Nice movie :-) The story is about escaping from jail,10
"Fine i guess, it was good i like it Fine i guess, it was good i like it",10
"I had heard a lot about the movie before seeing it..And I would wonder what would be so great about a prison movie.. But now after seeing it, i can say it is the best movie I've ever seen.. This is how movies should be.. And it proves that no special effects, technology, costumes, locations can substitute for good story and acting. I have never been so moved or influenced by any movie as I have by this one..It leaves you with a sense of happiness and deep satisfaction.. It is a thought provoking and emotionally uplifting movie which teaches us so much about life, hope, friendship..It has some memorable lines which really create an impact.. Acting by all actors is top notch.. Too sad the movie did not win a single Oscar.. The no.1 spot on IMDb is very well deserved.. It is timeless classic which will be remembered for years to come.",1
"This has to be one of the best movies I have ever watched! No movie real or fictional will ever face up to this one! I had never seen this movie until about 3 or 4 months ago and I had also heard so much about it, having watched it I've listened and heard it everywhere only good things and people saying it is the best movie ever and I 100% agree it is the best movie ever. There are some brilliant and creative movies out there but this movie really appeals to all our senses and is magnificent. I don't know how the writers even came up with such a good storyline. Also well done to the actors who played such a good part in the movie and made it come to life on the big screen. One of my fave actors was in it which made it for me and that was Morgan Freeman! I love his voice and I truly admire his acting skills. As a director and cameraman I admire the fantastic work of the cameramen and the brilliant directing. Well done to everyone involved in this movie, I imagine they are very proud of what they have created and indeed they should be!",10
"What to say about Shawshank, and why to say it when so many have tried. It is simply the best movie that you can see. My wife watched it and she doesn't understand why it is so powerful to me. What I've found is that this movie speaks to the soul of men. It's a tale of ultimate injustice, hope, friendship, and perseverance. Core themes that resonate deeply with men especially.

Tim's acting of Andy's indignation about his misfortune is masterful. Morgan's acting of Red's rediscovery of purpose is extremely satisfying. Two men from different walks of life, become the unlikely best of friends that makes everyone happy to invest in.

If you're only into explosions and nudity, this one isn't for you. If you want a movie that lays out bare what makes a man go on, here you go. ""Get busy living..""",9
"I actually don´t have any words to describe it. It is just mind blowing, awesome ...",10
"At the time of writing of this, there're already 4594 reviews. So I'll surely not go into the details.

It's been not more that 3 years that I watched The Shawshank Redemption for the first of numerous times. And it was certainly one of the best that I've or will ever watch. The narration, portrayal of characters and the plot line, everything in this movie is top notch. It's a masterpiece. Moreover, it's highly inspirational. You can easily watch this movie over and over without getting bored. And it will inspire you every single time. So if you're one of those unfortunate souls who haven't watched this movie, take out a couple of hours from your routine asap and get on with it. Then only you'll get the how good it really is or why do people like it so much!",10
"Best movie ever made, not much to nit pick or pick out amoungst pros and cons",10
"GOOD!!! Movie Morgan Freeman is a good actor, and he is still kicking it at 80 and hope for many many years to come",8
One of the best movie i ever watch The story of the film was coherent Events are sequential Photography is excellent I recommend watching it,7
"The greatness of this movie is beyond the stellar acting of Tim and Morgan, the remarkable story of Stephen King, the flawless screenplay or the wonderful direction of Darabont. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most beloved movies ever because it awakes something in the viewer.

The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie ever. I feel blessed because I was one of the few people that actually saw it in theaters in 1994, when it was considered a flop. I was 14 years old, and i saw it alone in an almost empty Morehouse. Don't ask me why I watched it, but to this day I remember what I felt inside that theater. I recalled feeling different, somewhat inspired and anxious to talk to someone about my experience. I bet every Shawshank lover remembers the first time they saw it, because is unforgettable and moving.

You can say that thanks to Shawshank I felt in love with movies, and the art of movie-making. After Shawshank I have seen thousands of movies, amazing movies... I felt in love with Hitchcock, and discovered the classics of Wilder and Capra, felt amazed with the creativity of Almodovar and Jeunet, but to this day I had yet to experience the same sensation of hope and wonder that I felt in that empty movie theater more than 10 years ago. If you haven't seen this movie, buy it, because you will want to see it again and again.",10

One of the great movies ever made.

It really has everything a movie should have and I wonder why Forrest Gump won the Oscar that year...",6
"I'll go out on a limb and say this is the greatest movie ever made. The first time you see this movie and are not aware of its ""secret"" it seems like an average movie, with a good plot and great acting. This is the rare movie that actually gets better the more times you watch it. I've seen it more than 30 times and I just never get tired of it. If you like movies about perservering in the face of adversity and never giving up, then this movie will definitely appeal to you. Be sure and buy the DVD so you can see the extras about the location and all the backstories related to the movie. It's well worth the price. The cinematography, the writing, the acting, the direction -- everything is brilliant. This is one case where the movie is actually far better than the book or short story.",9
"The best film I have ever seen. Period. No other film in history has come closer to perfection. In terms of the acting, the screen-writing, the directing, the music, the plot and its various sub-plots... The story in general is heart-warming and inspiring, portraying both the best and the worst of mankind. There are few films that I can watch over and over again without getting bored, but Shawshank Redemption more than any other movie does that for me. Even when I watch it for the umpteenth time at some point in 2014, I can guarantee that I will still feel the same goosebumps when Andy memorably advises Red to 'get busy living' or get busy dying', and the same upsurge of warmth, emotion, happiness and relief when Red is finally granted parole and he re-unites with Andy in the final scene. Perfection, perfection, perfection. 10/10",8
"There are so many histories to tell wherever is fiction or real life, and seeing movies is my favorite way to connect with these histories. This is a film that moves you, makes you really go deep into the story and connect with the characters. It is fantastically written and directed, keeps you entertained, makes you laugh and shed serious tears. I like to read, but one of the things I love the most is to watch movies, I saw this one when I was 15 and it opened my mind to a movie world that I never imagined, puts your mind into how life can be unfair and how to look a way out and take advantage with what you have in hand, and think that when you put your mind into something wonderful things can happen. I am sure I'm not the only one that has been touched by this film, and I don't know what to say anymore than this is one of the most wonderful movies ever made, with this one I became a Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabont's fan. Ever since this movie my list of genres change into a list with no numbers (maybe a handful of absolutely favorites), I see every film that time allows me. This is a movie that definitely is time very well spent and keeps lingering in your mind always.",9
"Nothing to say regarding this movie. Yea best of the best.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.

Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you.

The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995

Thank you.",9
"It's quite hard to even start rating this film as it is just simply ""Incredible""! The acting cast was amazing, the producer did an amazing job with the individuals he picked for each role. I watched this movie in the theatre many years ago and purchased the VHS tape as soon as it became available. Did the same when it was released on DVD and have watched it many times over. Well worth it.

Don't deny yourself the pleasure of this movie. If you haven't seen it by now, stop wasting time, get it, own it and greatly enjoy it.",10
I will get straight to the point. This movie was made with very careful attention to detail. According to the Formula of life (Time + Effort = Value) It fits perfectly. Unfortunately the fault I found with this movie was in the thought process behind the acting. I was never sure of where any of the actors stood with themselves or each other meaning the movie's great twist at the end had no meaning. Acting only ever needs to be amazing but the story needs to be exceptional because in real life people don't act extraordinarily its the story of peoples lives which touches us the most because everyone can relate or compare their story the acting is just according to the actor. But other then that it was interesting to watch not so much enjoyable which is always sad.,10
"This movie is the Masterpiece and a benchmark in every aspect of film making. I feel that movie of this level is not possible to make in this civilization again. I postponed watching this movie for almost one year thinking it being a prison based movie, how WRONG i was cannot be explained in words. I actually saw this movie by pausing and listening again and again. Direction screenplay cinematography & acting all are molded, seems as if god himself gave a hand into it and result is THE BEST CREATION ever in film making. As movie finished for the first time i saw all cast and names of everyone who made this masterpiece. This movie is a must must watch if you are least lover of movies.",8
A movie hard to forget. Excellent at every aspect. Great performances by Tim and Morgan.,10
"This movie is amazing, no doubt about it. Forget about all the people saying it's the most overrated movie of all time, they're just bitter. Maybe Shawshank didn't have the most amazing, jaw-dropping cinematography, camera work, etc. ever from start to finish (all the things that made films such as the Godfather so great. Granted, it's not like Shawshank had a lot to work with since a majority of the film was set at the prison), but it had an enjoyable, moving, inspirational story. It also had really enjoyable characters, particularly Andy Dufresne, who is my favorite fictional character. I liked him from the start.

Anyway, I think the Shawshank Redemption is the highest rated movie on this site because it's simply a great film. Easy to understand and follow, easy to love, and easy to be moved by. As IMDb has in the FAQ for this movie, ""It is perhaps worthwhile to remember that the top 250 list doesn't really measure what individuals consider the best movies of all time. It measures the collective opinion of the films in which people have the greatest positive feel when they are rating it. People are not voting for the movie against other movies. They are voting for it based on their opinion at the time have decided to rate it on IMDb."" So, when people complain about how it's overrated, just think about that.

Tim Robbins, when asked about why he chose to do this movie, (in addition to saying how he was moved and inspired by the story) said, ""it's not just about prison. It's about the limitations we put on ourselves and life, and the limitations, more importantly, we allow others to place on us. And if we listen to them, and we believe what these people are saying to us, then we're really building walls around ourselves. We're really building our own prison What the film is saying in a larger way is that in order to keep alive and keep living in a strong and thorough way that oftentimes you have to look beyond the walls around you. And you have to not believe in the prison and believe in that light, and that hope, and that person that you think you can be, and the person that you believe you are, and not listen to what your boss is saying, what your spouse is saying, what your leaders are saying."" I don't think I can elaborate much further. The Shawshank Redemption taught me to hold onto hope and believe in myself. I'm reminded of that Emily Dickinson poem, ""Hope is the Thing with Feathers,"" and I think it represents a lot of what Andy stood for.",10
"This movie is one of my all time favorites. I can quote this movie pretty much through the whole movie. It is a riveting film, and it never bores you. It makes you feel every emotion. It makes you laugh, cry, cheer, and empathize over the course of the movie. I've seen very few movies that almost every type of person enjoys. I seriously question people's tastes if they don't at least acknowledge the fact this was a brilliant movie. They don't have to like it ( which I find out pretty rare ) but they have to admit, they acting was great. Writing this review makes me want to watch it again. The ending always makes me smile.",10
"Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.

This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.

King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.",10
"This review is written to contribute my fair share to making sure this stays the number 1 film of all time, because it is really thoroughly deserved.

The beauty of the simplicity. The depth of the characters. The strength of the bonds. The legendary performances. The captivating score.

This movie excels on so so many levels. If you read this review and haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it. Turn off the lights, have a glass of wine with you and listen to the story of Andy Dufresne. It will stay with you for the rest of your life.",10
"It's hard to beat a classic, and this film ticks all the boxes of a classic box office hit. With a deep underlying moral, as well as a hard hitting narrative that makes you question how good a person you truly are, this film makes you think about life itself, and the security and contentment we all seem to fall into the trap of.

Freeman gives his all time best performance, with Tim Robbins' character Dufresne making you question your own true identity, and where do our morals lie?

Few films have ever been made with such subtext, and yet it is so blindingly brilliant how Darabont put together King's novel in such a way that an audience would have to be made of pure stone to not shed a tear during multiple poignant scenes.

All in all, this film is a truly magnificent masterpiece, faultless from the get go. If you have a film 'to-do' list, I advise you to place this at the very start, as there is not a single flaw.",9
"I was made to watch this film in my English class for doing coursework. I am sooo happy my teacher set me that work. A class of 30 teenagers walked way from the lessons we watched it in so influenced by the film heading to the shop to by their own copy. I am proud to say I was one of them. Once I got to uni and found out some people hadn't watched it I sat them down at night and forced them. Sadly watching it in a kitchen shared by 16 people even at night isn't the quietest place to watch this film. Half drunk student would walk in and all my friends who hadn't seen it turned to them and before they had chance to speak they were told to shut up so they could watch it in peace. I was happy to see my friends having the same reaction I had to the film. It is proof that a film doesn't need special affects to hook a bunch of young people onto it. It needs something and what ever it is the Shawshank Redemption has it by the bucket full. I am afraid to say I still have friends who haven't watched it but I will continue to try and get them to watch it and I hope you take up this fight, if you haven't watched it, watch it, if you have, make more people watch it.",10
"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.~ Mark Deming,",10
"Let me make this simple, this is one of the best films that you will ever see. For me it just might be the best film ever and I've watched a lot of films.",10
"I watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..

andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..

i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time..",10
"A true masterpiece, have seen the film many times and yet every time it gets better for me.. thats a true sign of a great film.

its not all about the prison break, so people getting this film to see an Escape from Alcatraz movie will be disappointed.

This film is about hope and so much more. Awesome acting, great soundtrack, and even better story thats unfolded in such a great way. I wish more movies would be like this.

Get busy living or get busy dieing.

this should be number #1 on IMDb, if you haven't seen it yet your missing a true classic",9
Worth every minute of watching. The bond between Red and Andy is something that today you won't see!,10
"One of the finest films made in recent years.The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best movie ever. I had heard a lot about this movie...never knowing what it really was but today I'm really amazed by the story and the acting of the actors...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving.A true masterpiece by ""Frank Darabont"". I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw TheShawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships,hopes, and dreams. After watching it for over 2 hours...you will understand it is definitely worth it!! OVERALL RATING: 9.8/10",10
"I like that part when it turns out to be an action movie. And now, some Lorem Ipsum to make the review longer:

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business is will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.",1
"A global movie with a lot of learning in terms of artistic composition, photography and soundtracks adjacent to the scene, which gives him a lot of connectivity",9
"To be fair, I also have to admit that I am a big fan of Stephen King and the screenplay was so honest to the story so there's probably that extra appreciation personally. I just read another review and I felt obligated to agree! There really aren't words to describe this movie. It gets better and better every time I see it and it doesn't matter where I start. I have seen it at least five times every year since 2000. It has to be my all-time favorite, hands down. The movies are the ultimate escapism for me and this movie does just that, yet it depicts something that we know too well, being a victim of circumstance or a witness of circumstances. Andy is the victim and Red is the witness, connecting in a way where you had to be there to understand. Kudos too to Stephen King for always knowing exactly how to capture our worst fears and materializing it. Whether it's the harsh punishment for a crime one did not commit or realizing that you've been so ""institutionalized"" by the very walls you hated that you no longer know how to live without it, this movie exudes a sense of hope much welcomed to many.And though some of us may not absolutely believe in it, we are nonetheless glad it's lingering just close enough for us to know it's there. It's such a well done piece, please go see it.",9
"The single greatest movie of all time, and I don't really feel like it can be debated. A movie that can move you to tears but also bring you feelings of joy that are rarely capable from a film. Truly the best.",9
"Good Movie, Good Film, Good Actors, Good Director, Good Crew all around. Highly overrated - this does not meen that this is s bad movie. - I just think, personally, that ""No Country for Old Men"" by the Coen Brothers is better...

"It has been way more than a decade, and a good movie stays a good movie, I am one of the young generations and still the movie even takes all my attention away, beginning to end.",10
Wow. I was really curious about why this is the top rated movie in this website. Now I get it.,9
"We don't need power to escape. We need patience. I have watched the movie only twice but it had the same impact both the times. Not going to give spoiler.

This movie opens your eyes on your life. Watch it, if you don't.

Can you work 20 years to achieve your dream?

A ray of hope..Masterpiece of true friendship.

Sometimes it will be more thrilling to watch good movies without exploring more reviews, don't search answers you can blindly watch this movie. It's a must watch movie for lifetime. Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies. Highly Recommended.

Enjoy the class! ;)",10
"This movie is wonderful in every way, from the direction and the performances to the technical side. It is one of those movies that transport you and make you part of the story it is telling.

The story is extraordinary, and it is very well told, which makes it an easy film to digest and very entertaining, without losing the complexity of what you want to show.

Without a doubt it is one of those movies that must be seen before dying and that I would recommend it to all kinds of people.

It is my favorite movie, without a doubt yes, and without discussion.",8
"i don't even know what to write about this movie. while i was leaving the theatre, i already knew it became my favorite movie. its degrading to this film to even call it a movie, its a masterpiece. a one of a kind portrait which can't be duplicated. every scene is perfectly crafted; perfectly filmed. the pace is perfect; there is never a dull, or too fast moment during the film. the music is beyond words, how the director was able to incorporate such feeling with the music he used is beyond my comprehensibility. the acting is phenomenal (obviously, how can Morgan freeman be bad in anything?), Tim Robbins ain't to shabby either. the writing is the true work of art, though. the script is completely magnificent; its a gem.

still to this day its by far my favorite movie, and let me tell you I've probably seen more movies than you've even heard of. its unique and thats the only thing that one movie has to stand out from all the other movies created in this business. and let me tell you, oh how this movie stands out.",10
"The movie Shawshank Redemption is based on a novel from Stephan King. The movie is directed by Frank Darabont (1994) and it is one of the best movies ever made. The movie is not only a depressing story but it contains friendship, loyalty, hope and wisdom. Andy (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and his lover. he is sent to Shawshank prison. He has a life long sentence and in his time in prison Andy becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman). Andy tries to adapt to the life in prison and does this together with his friend Red. Through time Andy overcomes the tortures of prison, and he tries to inspire other prisoners (""While the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can never be truly imprisoned). The movie shows the determination of Andy and leads us into a world of imagination, filled with courage and desire. The setting of the movie is extremely realistic and the establishing shot immediately shows the setting of the movie, so you know what to expect. I personally think Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made. It has already been a number one movie on IMDb for a while now. The costumes, the make-up and acting are done extremely well and the story is very well thought through. To conclude, the movie has many inspiring messages in it, such as ""never give up"" and ""always have hope to achieve what you want"" for example.",9
"This movie is the definition for hope! All those souls who lost their hope due to unfortunate reasons must watch this film.

Morgan Freeman's brutally honest words when asked about rehabilitated are life changing. You can never change the past nor control the future, but you can change the mood of the day by touching someones' heart with your smile.

In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring. Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed.",10
One of my favorite movie of all time it's a amazing that characters are well placed and put up there 100% in acting...must watch...,8
"This is (just like Shutter Island) one of the best movies I've ever saw in my whole life. This film is really long, but it doesn't matter, for me it wasn't long enough! :) I really liked the whole story, from the beginning till the very end. It is a pretty sad movie at some points, but at the end it's actually a 'feel-good' movie. After watching this you realize how happy you have to be because you are a free man. Some people spend they're whole life in prison, and that's pretty sick. Because yeah, you life only 1 time, and now I really know how lucky I am. This movie is now number 1 for a very long time, that means 1 thing: you definitely need to watch this, you can't die without watching this movie! You won't regret it :). It is pretty funny to see Morgan Freeman acting in his younger years, then you realize how old this movie actually is. Time flies by, and that's actually one of the lessons you learn from this movie.",10
"This movie was great, and well worth watching. This is my first review and I just watched the film for a fourth time now, just to write this and I can say as much that story and acting pulled me in and gave me some form of escape from reality just as the first time.

TSR can have pretty dark at moments at times, but in truth I think its a story about hope and one mans desperation for it.

I'd like to bring attention especially to the quality of the acting in most films there are times when we see or hear something in a way that we don't believe and it disturbs the false reality a film is supposed to project, but Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman so effortlessly pull it off that not once did I falter in my belief that I was watching the story and life of Andy Dufresene and Ellis ""Red"" Redding.

that is of course till the screen went dark and the credits rolled.",10

"If you haven't seen this masterful work of art you haven't lived. One of the only movies I can say must be seen by everyone before they die. Everything about this movie has already been said, and I can't recommend it more. GO WATCH IT!

Morgan Freeman is such a great actor and he shines in this alongside every other actor. They're casted to perfection and I loved every single bit of this movie. Easily one of my favorites of all time and one of the greatest pieces of film making you will ever see in your entire lifetime. Go see this before someone spoils it for you. You are doing yourself a disfavor if you skip out on this one. There's a reason why it's the highest rated film of all time on IMDb.",9
"I have to admit, I never read the novel this is based on. But I'm guessing the people who don't like the movie at all (which is fine), either haven't read the book or don't like the book. I'm saying this, because what you are getting here, is very close to adult films. Something people in Germany (censors that is), do not have a problem with (the movie is rated 16+).

I can only guess the movie will be NC-17 (if they rate it) in America. There are explicit images of male genitalia, a lot bare breasts (though mostly of our main female lead). With all that said, I went into the movie with the impression I wouldn't like it at all.",10
"I was very frustrated of my life when I saw the movie. And after completing it, I found a new me in myself. In every moment of these movie I was thinking how would it finish. And it was so unexpected when I saw the escape of hero. This is not only a movie but also a lesson of inspiration, motivation & confidence. Really we shouldn't give up anything we started.

There may be hardship, hassles & for these reasons if we leave our work then we've to stay frustrated for whole life. And if you try hard then it may take time but certainly light will illuminate the darkness of every disappointment of your life. This movie just taught me this.

Besides, as usual morgan freeman was awesome & I must say his quotes from background that made the movie more enjoyable. Thanks to the script writer, director, actors & every man who are involved in making this awesome movie.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that would move you to tears. I Know many people would agree with me when i say that this is one of the the best movies ever made and you would too once you see it.It mainly revolves around. It was nominated for 7 Oscars and 1 golden globe. I'm a bit sad that it didn't win any Oscars, cause it deserved at least one ,for best picture.The story focuses on Andy a man who was convicted for murdering his wife and his wife's lover. He was imprisoned in Shawshank prison, where he met Red. The story revolves around Andy and Red increasing their friendship and Andy doing all sorts of stuff in changing the prison.If it was up to me, I'd give it a 9.8 rating.",10
Deferentially worth being number 1 on top 250 list. Its one of those movies that you always watch when its on TV.,10
"Every movie I have ever watched more than once - and i have watched a lot - has at least one scene that i would either skip or use to go grab something from the fridge, turn up/down the AC or something. Except The Shawshank Redemption. From the opening scene till the very end, i want to do nothing but sit through and watch, feel and react to each part of the story.

Everything in the film fits together in an amazing harmony, engaging all your senses and emotions from the very beginning. This is my humble opinion, and I am not surprised to see it on the top of so many lists.

A true example and a benchmark to many film makers, from story to acting, cinematography to editing.",10
"A film that you will never forget There are just too many words to explain about this film. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins relationship in the film is a major part of the film as well as surviving shawshank with everything it has to offer. A must see film and is something you cannot turn down. From the acting to the directing to it's amazing story of a man who is accused of murdering his wife and is put into shawshank prison were he meets red (Morgan Freeman) before getting to know him he goes through tough times in the cell. Everything about this film is just unbelievable.

Honestly just watch it for sure",10

"One of the best films ever. The rating of this film could not be more fitting. Just talking about a film like this makes me want to rewatch it. This film lesson on hope, incredible acting, amazing script, great soundtrack are what make it deserve the top 5 spot for me. Its amazing and never met anyone who did not love the movie. I would recommend it to anyone.",1
"I just wanted to post a few words in order to show my support for this movie. In my opinion, it is THE best movie I have ever seen in my life; and I have seen thousands, (literally). I won't say anything more about how good this movie is, due to the fact that it has all been said in other posts, but I would like to say something to the people who don't like it, and who may even go so far as to rate it with a 1 out of 10; you are all retarded.

I first asked myself; how could 7,000 people have possibly gave it a one? Well, how did George W. Bush, the complete moron, get elected to be the president of the United States of America? Sure, there were some other reasons, but it's mostly because people are completely retarded. So I guess that answers my question. As a matter of fact, I'm surprised there aren't MORE retards giving this classic film masterpiece a bad rating.

Also, the people who made bad comments about it seem to keep talking about how it's all hype and how the ignorant masses who love the movie are all wrong. Whatever fools. I first watched it around ten years ago, all by myself, when I had never even heard of it in my life. I stayed up all night watching it on TBS Superstation, (the only station I know of which somehow managed to have more commercials than actual movie), and I loved it instantly. There was no hype there, just me and an awesome movie.

I mean, I don't EVER go around telling people about movies cause frankly, I don't care what anyone watches, but I have not stopped recommending this one to anyone and everyone since the night I watched it ten years ago. I also NEVER post my opinions about movies online, because once again, I couldn't care less what people watch, but there's just something about this one, and only this one, that makes me want to tell everyone to watch it. So there you have it, I ain't no fake critic trying to pretend I know about all the different aspects which make for a good movie, by any means, but I'm tellin ya......just watch it and if you don't like it at least somewhat, then you should attend some form of IQ testing facility immediately because you are probably half a retard lol. PEACE.",10
"First, I read Stephen King's ""Different Seasons"" as soon as it came out (I was around 19 I guess), and was enthralled by his writing. Of course, I had no idea 3 out of the 4 novellas would eventually adapted into movies, but I am not surprised. It is impossible to put whatever pictures you have in your mind onto the screen, so that is why everyone compares the book to the movie. The same happened to me with ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (HIGHLY recommend reading the book), even with Bogie playing, it was a tough transition to see it on the screen. I assume at least 80-90% of those who saw either one never read the books. ANYway...the Shawshank Redemption was very ""full"" of character development, and amazing passion from Morgan Freeman especially. He is an expert in his craft, and for me, his peak. I will be watching this soon again with my wife who has not seen many American films.",9
"This movie has almost everything you need. Twists, love... everything.

I can't really say something badly about this movie and trust me i've seen EVERYTHING there is to see.

If i want to pick on something that is bad about this movie i have to really watch thru it just to cover something bad but i won't do that.

So yes i recommend this movie for everyone.

9/10

Only why i don't give it 10/10 is because it's not my favorite genre of movie but that's all >_<

There are lots of movies you can compare with this masterpiece, like the godfather movies and others you see in the top 250 IMDb list.",10

If you were just born and didn't know what one movie to watch before you died at age 1, I would put this down as #1 for sure.

Just watch it. It really is all the it reviewed for to be and continues to change movie making history as one of the greats.

"A really good film , Loved it. Well worth a watch.",10
"Awesome film! The ending is the pay-off! If you enjoy films like King stories like the 'Green Mile' you're going to enjoy this! The film is a period piece, so though I've only just recently watched it, and noted the date it was made- it doesn't even matter. The characters are real, and the settings are very authentic. There were only a couple of things I can honestly say I didn't like. One of them was how prison life seemed to be portrayed. I think it was a lot worse than what was shown. I also disliked how 'all-powerful' the warden was. It was heartbreaking when he had the character of Tommy Williams killed off. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were fantastic!",10
"Have to say i have watched this movie over the years probably 15 times or more and it never gets old or boring. Great prison film with some good meaningful acting and some fun also along the way. The acting from all of the cast is great and some stand out a bit more than others. There is some violence in there and some that may be a little upsetting to some people who like light hearted TV but some parts of this film really do take it a bit further than your boring films with no decent plot. The plot is well thought out and provides some interesting twists and turns that will keep you glued to your seat and waiting for more action.

Watch the first 15 minutes and you will be hooked

"This movies is almost perfect. Like many movies I would say it could be a tad shorter. Though that does add to truly feeling like Andy has been in prison as long as he has been. The music, the photography, the acting, the writing... it is all perfect. I don't know anyone who doesn't not like this film. I think it gets better with time. I want to buy this soundtrack I loved Thomas Newman's score so much. I think it is my favourite piece of his. Even the supporting characters in this film are fantastic. The guards, the other prisoners. All performances are 100% gripping. I can't even tell you how many times I have seen this film and try to enforce that anyone who hasn't start watching as soon as they can.",8
"I don't know how many times I've seen this film, and it still is as entertaining as it's ever been. The directing is excellent. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the best choices for their respective rolls, and the story makes you wonder why Steven King ever wrote a horror novel to begin with. Even the trailer to this movie is probably one of the best I've ever seen.

This is one of those movies that I've unwittingly been recruited as a salesperson for. In other words, I feel I need to show this movie to all my friends and family who haven't seen it, and I'm more than willing to watch it again. If you love this movie as much as I do, then don't forget to watch the younger brother of this film, The Green Mile. Written and directed by the same crew. It's a great film, but has a lot to live up to.",8
"I'm not going to tip toe around it, this film is crap. Its completely unoriginal, its not artistic, its not demanding (except for being boring).

You will not learn anything about the world through this film.

This film is not a part cinematic history, unlike nearly all other films in the top 250.

It is predictable and emotional crap.

But even if your not into cinema, and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out there...basically any on the video shelf.",10
"I don't know about best movie ever, but it was good. It had a good plot. Proper acting and actors. An abstract theme. It had a certain fascination. The writing was very good. Besides all those good things, to me it simply wasn't a movie that I would go around bragging about. I can see why people are head over heels about this movie, because it simple is one of those movies that leaves a mark in the mind of movie goers. To me it was one of those movies where it would leave you like ""wow, that was a pretty good and interesting movie"", but then you wouldn't watch it again for years. I first watched it almost a year ago and I haven't seen it again since. In my mind a great movie is one you can't get enough of, you just want to watch it over and over till you can't anymore, and I simply didn't get that from this movie. So my opinion is, it was good, but it wasn't great.",10
"About Movie: The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. My perspective: It is one of the favorite movie i ever seen...very inspirational, motivational and great movie. The movie depicted all kind of emotions from the characters in the life like humor, joy, surprise, excitement, vengeance, jealous, untruthful, being alone, disappointment, self motivation, Corruption, wired feeling. This movie taught me that one has not give up his or her wish at any circumstances..From this movie i understand one should not wish for immediate result it may disappoint them, but if he or she should focus on the progress towards the goal. It only give real success. after watching this movie, i ask myself what is your purpose of the life because hero will redemptive entire jail even he is in the prison.",9
"This will forever be a classic. ""get busy livin or get busy dyin""",9
"it's came out in 1994 and was an absolute flop but found its real audience in home video, peaking as the most rented video of 1995 in the USA.

A wonderful film that takes you into the prison experience of Red(Morgan Freeman) and Andy (Tim Robbins). Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails.

The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permanent have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.

The fact that this film is sitting at No.1 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them. I only wish that I could view the film for the first time again, and experience that redeeming feeling Andy and Red experienced at the end.

Ignore the hype surrounding the film and judge it on your own experience, the last half hour are especially beautiful. Watch this if you already haven't, and enjoy the masterpiece that Frank Darabont has so gracefully given us the privilege of viewing. 8/10",10

When first time I watched this movie, it was a kind of detective movie I've seen a lot of it myself. But, after I watched whole scenes, it took me a kind of excitement and more unpredictable than I thought.

If you have any sports cards without this listed as a favorite film it's rare!

It's a film about a guy who is about to die and he talks to Tom Hanks about this. Tom's acting is pretty plastic he morphs into the character like Bruce Lee's water speech. I've seen this on VHS, DVD and MPEG-4. If you have this on any of these I recommend watching them.",10

"Print Page It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.

Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.",10

This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!,10

"This movie does an excellent job of portraying all characters in this movie and showing how each individual deals with the fact/probability that they might never see life outside of prison walls, while also showing how certain inmates manage to handle freedom once being let out of prison. A truly inspirational movie showing the strength of hope and willpower while not being too extremely over the top and using an ending to make all viewers feel good about how everything resolves itself and lets viewers have the entire story come full circle with a true sense of irony at the very end. An awesome film that is well directed with an excellent ""mood"" surrounding the entire movie. The acting keeps right up with and for the most part exceeds the directing.",4
"Clearly this was a movie that needed word-of-mouth to find an audience, and indeed business was slowly but steadily growing when it was yanked from theaters. If it had been left to find its way, it might have continued to build and run for months, but that's not what happened.",10
this is my 2nd film review and i hope i do better. this is a great film i own this movie and its in my top 30 having Morgan Freeman in the movie is the best i love his movies and that's one reason i love this film. the film is so good my friends watches this movie over and over again. its so great. it gets annoying though but they like it and so do i. Morgan Freeman is a great actor and i respect him and in in this movie he played the friend of an odd man a great man. what can i say about this movie i love the movie as i wrote and the characters are great and so are the actors.and that is about it i cant say anything else. apart from why i gave it an 8 is because i think it could have been greater.,7
"This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.",10

"When I was a teenager, I read a book called Different Seasons which, at the time, was a series of short stories by a man named Richard Bachman.

Richard Bachman, as it turns out, was actually Stephen King.

King was apparently worried that having his name on this book would cause people to have preconceived notions and possibly judge the work by his name alone, rather than by it's contents.

Among the short stories in this book was one titled, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, on which the film was based.

There are a lot of memorable characters and happenings throughout, and in the center of all of them is Andy Dufresne, who was accused of killing his wife for sleeping with a golf pro at the local country club.

Andy claims he is innocent, but is convicted and sent to prison for the murder.

This film does a very good job of staying true to the story, with only a few minor changes that do not effect the outcome.

Without giving too much away, I will just say that this film is the highest rated on IMDb for a reason. It is about so many different things that it would take some time to list them, would have to contain spoilers and would not do the film justice.

This movie will elicit many different emotions and is definitely worth the viewing.",10
"This movie is intertwined with my growth as an advocate, appreciater and lover of the art of film. So much of my life has been invested into devouring films that the world's movie industrys have the passion and drive to produce, movies like this are the reason why.

After viewing a genorously eclectic mix of genres and sub genres of titles over the years; I have still not found a more well balanced and humble portrail of human struggle/condition than the Shawshank Redemption. Although most of us cannot truly relate to serving a lengthy sentence in a 1940s penetentuary, Darabont manages to capture subtle yet poinient moments that the populous can empathise with.

The piece seems to encapsulate one of those rare moments where the writing adaptation, acting, cinimatography, score and directorial vision allign to create a masterpiece.

The fact that this is the highest rated movie of all time on IMDb gives me hope that ratings of the masses are capable of being pointed in the right kind of direction.

I gave a 10 star, but would prefer to give a 9.5. That way, the cinematic optimists can have faith that we are destined for more exceptional movies like this.",9
"Shawnshank Redemption is one of the greatest films of all time. And this is why.

Tim Robbins a accountant who is wrongly convicted of murder and sent to Shawshank prison where he friends up with Morgan Freeman and his gang. The beautiful cinematography and dialogue make the film emotionally moving and beautiful. Morgan Freeman narration is brilliant alongside his chemistry with Robbins.

This is a must see movie for any movie lover. With it being on most streaming websites it's easily accessible to watch this classic.

"This movie is perfect in every sense. It depicts real life and tells us to look for hope even when everything is lost. Keep focus on what our inner energies are guiding us towards. And it proves that patience is the key to success.

A very heartwarming experience and a must watch for everyone on planet earth!",10
"As a rule I never give films the perfect 10 score but The Shawshank Redemption comes as close to achieving it as possible. The Shawshank Redemption has everything you could ask for in a film. On first viewing it will make you laugh, cry and keep you guessing until the end.

A review of this film doesn't have to be longer than three words: Watch this film.",10
I liked this movie. It's very impressive. It's on my list. Everbody must watch. Main characters and others are great in this movie. I'm suggesting to everybody.,10
Yes I like it indeed because it is good and I hope some people like it,10
One of my old time favorites!! Definitely in the top 10 for best movies,10
"This movie is excellent, regarding every aspect! You can't stop watching it 'till its last second! The acting is great, all actors are amazing, the story is kind of genius, very well-conducted, specially for a long movie as this one! And of course, it was written by Stephen King, one of my favorite authors. In fact, I think this movie gets the #1 place in all book adaptations from him! Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins matched perfectly, two amazing artists. Every detail of this movie grabs your attention without you even notice! The first time I saw this movie (maybe 2 years ago), I started watching knowing that it was elected as the #1 movie of all time, here in IMDb, but even though I was not expecting too much, I'm now a huge fan of it! I totally recommend, worthy watching! ;)",8
A gift from mankind to mankind. If aliens come to earth we have to make them watch this masterpiece. They might spare us!,5
"What can I say? This movie has all the makings of what true cinema are: Drama, suspense, a little bit of comedy and nearly every other emotion known to man. I have watched this movie probably nearly 30 times over the years and it never gets old. I would rate this personally in my top 25 films of all time. This is film making at it's finest. And if you are one of the few Americans out there who has not seen this movie at some point, I promise you won't be disappointed!",9
"Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.

In a word, to MTV, he called the post ""hilarious,"" which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder: I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that fans think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer.

In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.

Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult.",10
"The film is in my opinion, one of the few 'perfect movies' ever made. From the cinematography to the cast to the script. Every element of this film is a 10/10. One of the things that hits me the hardest are films about redemption. Someone overcoming a terrible hardship or someone getting a second chance in life. This is definitely one of the greatest redemption stories ever told.

The performances are spectacular. From the leads on down. Definitely my favorite Morgan Freeman performance of all time (and there a lot of good ones to choose from.) Tim Robbins was born to play this role. He shines so bright and his arc is amazing to watch. The supporting cast is also excellent.

The pace and flow of the film is also done so well. The film runs pretty long but it feels like to goes by quick. The story is told in such a way that keeps you so engulfed that you don't realize that two hours plus have just passed.

A little known fact about this movie is that it is based off a Stephen King novella. Another interesting side note is that Morgan Freeman's character of ""RED' was named that in the book because he was an Irishman with red hair. Thankfully they went outside of the box when casting and brought in Freeman. If they had not, we would have been robbed of one of the greatest performances ever brought to the silver screen.",10

Movie to watch over and over and over again for life.,10
"I dont know exactly what I liked about the movie,but I actually loved it",10
I have seen this more than 5 times. It is truly inspiration story .,9
"Must see, please do not read the reviews on this movie until you have seen it, you would repent your decision if you came to know the story.

So much detailed, full of suspense - yet nobody could guess what (the hell) was going on! The poster, small hammer (or whatever), the book keeping - and above all the HOPE - I am so much impressed by this film. It never looked like a movie of such a fantastic end. Well, one could guess that Andy (Tim) might not have murdered his wife, but it was difficult to imagine the depth in story. I am inclined to read the novel now. Would you believe, this movie was recommended by the DVD shop owner, who I thought was interested only in the hit (read well-known) movies.",10
"I don't get emotional over movies very often, but The Shawshank Redemption makes me feel so many different emotions in roughly two and a half hours that I can't help but watch this movie as often as my family and I can stand it.",10
"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.

But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.

Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.

Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.

There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.

The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.

The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.

Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",10
"Excellent movie. I don't watch old movies but this was GOOD. First of all, this movie has meaning. Like this generation movies is about nothing (I don't say that every movie but a lot). Second, actors were great, professional and knew their job. All in all this was best 2 hours of my life :)",10
"Love this movie. The gotcha at the end is great. Shows how jacked up the system was back then. Frankly to similar to some systems today. Watching the characters struggle with adapting to life in prison, and then life outside...heartbreaking. Leaves you smiling though. I would not want to swim in literal crap, but ya do what ya gotta do, right?",7
The movie deserves to be first movie of top 250. i think it was a flawless film in all respects.,9
"It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.",10
Great movie!!! one of best in history i saw this many times,10
"No human being can call this movie less than what it is, perfection. Anyone from film lovers to casual movie watchers will love this movie. It has humor, tragedy, triumph, the good guys win, the bad guys lose. All the tropes everyone loves are nailed on the head with this movie and done tastefully and gracefully. If you haven't watched it, you need to!",10
"In all honesty, this was one of the biggest surprises I'd seen in the movies in a long time. This is also one of the few movies that I can safely say that the majority of well minded individuals will find entertaining. But now, into the actual content of the film. For starters, the opening sequence with the imperial walkers is not only one of my favorite cinema memories; it's also a staple point in the advancement of sci-fi films. Though the love story may have seemed a bit trite to some, I found it tasteful and appropriate. Once again, I was blown away with the final light saber sequence and though I won't spoil it, let's just say that a very important character drops one spicy meatball.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption holds the Number 1 spot in the Top 250 English Movies listed by IMBd with 9.3 ratings. It is one of the best movies ever made in World Cinema.

Given how gorgeous the movie is, it is not surprising that it receives such a high rating. What more can I add that hasn't already been said? The script, the performances, and the basic idea are all there, but the main focus of this film is how it makes you feel. Unlike some movies that you watch and then forget about days later, this movie sticks with you after you've seen it.

The ultimate tale of friendship, optimism, and of surviving hardship.

Although I don't think this is the greatest movie ever made, I can see why so many people do. You must watch it if you haven't or haven't in a while because it's incredible. 10/10.",10
"What can be said about Shawshank that hasn't been said already? Nothing. It's a must-see for anyone at any age. Well acted, beautiful cinematography, brilliantly written. Did it get robbed of it's Best Picture Oscar? I mean, it's better than Forrest Gump - for sure - but better than Pulp Fiction? That's a rough decision.

From the opening of the movie to the very end there is no downtime, there are no shortcomings. The opening of the film might be one of the best openings of any film that I can personally think of. The sweeping view of the prison yard - that is cinema magic how they timed and planned out that scene.",7

every second of the movie is balanced ...without any additional and impractical elements ......",8
"This is without doubt one of the best movies! And what makes it great is also what makes me somewhat ""unhappy"" with this film. This is a film best enjoyed the very first time you watch it.",10
Shawshank redemption is one of the greatest movies in the history of movies production ... This movie has drama suspense Comedy and it aced all these categories Before talking about this movie we should mention that it wasn't the great movie in the year of its production ...hadn't a great success in cinema because in 1994 there were alot of magnificent movies But actually this movie is the best and we easily can prove it by looking at the top 10 movies in IMDB and we could easily understand that it's the 1st since I was born I rated this movie 10 and i was pleased watching it,9
"The pursuit of freedom never stops. This is my perception of the entire film. As long as people exist in society, they will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. Naturally, there are good and bad, but these are not the content we want to entangle. What should really be handled is that no matter what, you and I will not be the previous selves.",8
"I have watched this film more times than I care to remember, yet I am still mesmerized by the characters, the fickleness of humans and how greed and power corrupt a person's reasoning.

As always Morgan Freeman's acting is so perfectly understated and Tim Allen was a perfect choice.

The most poignant moment and the part that I remember primarily is the female Italian Opera being played over the speakers to create complete silence among the prisoners as they listen to what may be the first female and the first music since being a prisoner.

A complete cult classic!!",9
CLASSIC !!!! LEAVE ME FEELING CLEANER FOR HAVING WATCHED THEM,8
JUST PERFECT !!!! A CLASSIC PIECE OF UNFOGETTABLE FILM MAKING,5
This an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable 20 years dug in the jail without nobody know. The Shawshank Redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. All the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind I simply love it.,10
One of the most fascinating movies Literally made my whole life meaningful Thanks Andy,9
We cant see movie like that anymore. Evrybody most see this masterpieces before dead.,10
"The film is so good, and since the thousand nine hundred and ninety-four beautiful films like this one couldn't be done even today.",10
"what has not been said about this film, it tells the tale of a broken man in a broken situation, to me it inspired me to make a film the way the shots are framed for example Brooks parole and the fact no one is looking at him conveys a sense of loneliness that he did not get while in prison. His death hits so hard because everyone had a connection with him, everyone had a feeling towards him. Now Red and Andy are perfect examples of character arcs, they both start in the same place and end up in a better situation then they were at the start, they comping off better off because in prison they have both changed from what they were Red a killer and Andy the man who feels sorry for himself, and the contrast between them the fact that Red comes out through the system he came out legally after coming in illegally and Andy coming in innocent and escaping illegally, showing prison changed him from what he was making the film a perfect idea of a character arc that every screenwriter in the modern day needs to watch because there are no characters like theses in film at all. As close as a perfect film you can get and even though I am a film director and writer, its sad that I know I will never make a film this good, but I can always try and fully deserves top rated film on IMDb.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption IMHO is truly the greatest movies of all time. It is my personal favourite and I can not comprehend how anyone would not like this film. After seeing it, for nearly a dozen or so times, I can still see it with the same fervor and excitement. Not one moment of this movies is dull or uninteresting. The cast is brilliant, especially Tim Robbins as the wrongly accused Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red. Also, the greedy and treacherous warden is wonderfully portrayed by Bob Gunton. The film sends a message about hope and the human spirit. The movie has several subplots, which each have their own pace. Andy making friends with his inmates first and then the prison guards, his building of the library, him tutoring Tommy, working for conniving Warden Norton, escaping from prison and then Red getting out and going to find him, all of which never create a boring moment. The best part of the movie is after when Andy escapes, and the story of Red untill he meets Andy. I also liked the part when Brooks gets out and cant seem to cope with the changed pace of life after being ""institutionalised"" for nearly 40 years. It is hope which keeps this movie alive. The hope that someday Andy will get out, the hope that Red will see his friend once again really sends a message of inspiration, to never lose hope. As Red truly says, ""Get busy livin', or get busy dying ""! The score by Thomas Neuman is also brilliant. For those people who have not yet seen this movie, you should definitley watch it whenever you get a chance. A true masterpiece. I cannot see how this movie did not get Best Picture. Forrest Gump can not even be compared to this film.",10
Finally you would be happy after watching this movie,10
I watched this film after 25 years thinking it was overhyped. How wrong was i? In 2019 i still feel this as an intense movie. This breaks my bar i set for a green mile.,10
"This movie has made my top 5 list. I heard people talk about this movie including my parents. All I ever heard was good reviews, but just watched it for my first time just under a year ago.

About a week ago I bought it and love watching it. I watched it twice in a week and want to watch it again. The movie was put together really great. It has a good plot and a lot of unexpected things happen. If you like ""The Green Mile"", you will love this movie. If you like prison movies you will love this movie. If you like action, drama, love, and any other kind of movie you will love The Shawshank Redemption.

The actors are great in the movie and it was well directed. There are several moments in the movie that are very moving, even for the Macho Men :-P If you want to watch a great movie watch the (in my opinion) #1 best movie of all time. The Shawshank Redemption.

Oh and like a read on a post on the message board, it has the best closing line ever.",10
Very good acting from Morgan Freeman. Nothing more to say than this. I'm giving it a 9!,5
"This is one of the best movies of all time. Very powerful and pulled you into the story. The story of Andy is one you can relate to and follow, but he continues to move on with this life.

The supporting cast of characters play well into the whole movie. Morgan is such an excellent person and actor and his supporting role is one of his finest in this film.

There are some light hearted parts to this movie, and there is also some heavy parts as well, it's a great blend of emotional ranges as you watch this film.

If you don't have this in your collection, you should. Find a way to own this for your own collection!",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless classic that has captured the hearts of movie lovers for over 25 years.

"I liked it very much, very elaborate plans and an excellent distribution. The Interpretation of the protagonists is detailed and neat, so that These have a lot of depth. As for the plot thread, do not It leaves the eyes of the screen for a single moment. The Locations are very varied and the art direction fills the Scenarios leaving them perfect for interpretation. In general Spectacular and very Tarantino.",10
This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!

"A banker unjustly blamed for the death of the woman and her lover and was taken to prison «Shawshank». Twenty years organized the escape plan and succeeded thanks to a poster of Rita Hayworth and the Bible. Those who have seen the movie know that the last exit from prison was Rita. (We do not say details of the film to enjoy it who have not seen) The film is based on the novel by Stephen King with the same title, which sold the rights to the book the director and friend, Frank Darabont (Frank Darabont), just one dollar. The Ntarampot changed the title, and considered that would mislead the public, in «The Shawshank Redemption». Two months it took to complete the script, which he claimed was the best he had ever read in his life. Immediately presented to companies and did not take long to start shooting. For the role of the banker Andy Ntoufrens producers think Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner, but the first two refused and chose Tim Robbins. O Costner few years later admitted that he regretted that decision. The Robbins spent some time in isolation to prepare mentally for the role of Andy Ntoufrens. For the role of the Red, the retentate coming in close contact with the Ntoufrens, the director chose Morgan Freeman, because of his voice. Although the description in the book did not fit his appearance Freeman as the Red supposed to be Irish, the director was erect. Indeed, Freeman today sees Red the most important role in his career. In September 1994 it came out in theaters. Day projection, the director with the producer went into one of the largest movie theaters of America and saw license. The title of the film according to Freeman was why we failed, but is not fault it. At that time the competition was tough, as they had been released and the leading Pulp fiction films and Forrest Gump. Although not well went in cinemas caused a sensation in video clubs and is still one of the best films of all time. The public opinion changed after seven Oscar nominations and after he started playing on television. However won no Oscars. Features of tickets to the movies earned just $ 20 million and sales in video clubs 80 million",2
"Brilliant movie, brilliant story, brilliant acting",10
One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you.,10
"Review from Roger Ebert: There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job.

What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.

"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.",10
"This is the story of a man named Andy DuFresne, an intelligent man convicted for murdering his infidel wife, despite claiming innocence. DuFresne experiences the harsh conditions inside the prison and suffers, but works from within in search of some form of redemption. I'd recommend 15+. There's a lot of brutal, unlawful violence against prisoners, often in detail, while the overall message of how a prison spell can destroy a man mentally and physically is very depressing. There's a very sad suicide halfway through.",10

Chinatown is better. Ran is a better movie. It is in Japanese. All About Eve is better. Up is better. To Kill a Mockingbird is better. Amélie is a better film--and it is in French. I could easily name two score other movies that are better than the highly overrated ""The Shawshank Redemption.""

Pathetic.",10
"Fantastic story line and stunning visuals = a true masterpiece.

After watching this, I really have to reconsider what I have voted for a 10 until now. It beats everything, although I can't really compare to anything I have seen before. Simply a must see, and it is worth your time, even twice! :)

Not a coincidence that this film is the first one on the big list of IMDb. If I only had one wish that I would say, that I want to work in a film like that! Furthermore It has really everything in it, and the plot twists are amazing, although some of them can be expected but not surely.

Maybe the exposition was long, but on the other hand it really helped to feel that kind of atmosphere.",10
"I watched this movie for the first time when I was 24 or 25 and I regret every second of my life prior, simply because I didn't take the 2 hours and 22 minutes out of my life to watch this phenomenal movie!",10
"I finally watched this movie when I was 24 or 25, and I regret every second of my life that I didn't spend watching it prior to that. This movie is phenomenal. Looooong, but totally worth it!",10
"You should watch this movie at least once, you won't regret it",10
"This movie is the greatest prison movie I have ever seen. The storyline is original and the performance of Tim Robbins is superb. The movie is about Andy Dufresne is convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover and tells the story of his double life sentence behind bars at Shawshank prison which uses religion as a form of rehabilitation. During his sentence he is bashed constantly for three years until he meets a fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding who is asked by Dufresne to help him escape. With his escape comes the signature scene as Andy escapes through the sewers to freedom. The end of the film highlights the ability of two friends to overcome adversity to achieve a central goal. The screenplay is superb as this is based on the novel by one of the best or the best horror of all time, Stephen King. The movie is a movie that explores the REAL story behind bars and the ability of people to escape mentally and spiritually with rehabilitation",10
A movie which makes you live through the story with a wholesome ending. I cannot think of a single thing which wasn't of perfection in this movie & I have watched it multiple times and still enjoy it. One must play with the cards which have been dealt & with intelligence & wisdom one can find their way through even the greatest of obstacles.,10
"This is my go to favorite movie of all time, there's comedy, drama and suspense. I've seen a lot of movies over the years but even as time goes on its a movie that never gets old. The characters are all believable and you feel for them in parts. When it gets to the end I always wish that it went on a bit longer but the ending is fitting with the story.",10
"""Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying"" This is one of the few movies, I'd give a 10/10.

1994 was an amazing year for movies. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and this.While Stephen King adaptations and novels are known for their supernatural horror elements, this movie incorporates a different, real horror of the Shawshank Prison.

Accompanied by amazing performances from Tim Robbins and the evergreen Morgan Freeman and meticulous direction from Frank Darabont, this is one of the few movies, one has to see in their lifetime.

I think the IMDb ranking of this movie is enough for you to give this movie a chance.",10
This is not one of the but the best movie that you can or will watch in your lifetime.,10
"I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies.

One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect.And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch.

"This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.

King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.

What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",10
"This film is the second time that James Whitmore (who plays Brooks in this film) plays an incarcerated character who fears release. The first, was The Twilight Zone episode: On Thursday We Leave For Home (1963)

Made me cry nonstop. This has to go down in my top 5 best movies of all time",10
One of the best movies ever. I think this film should play more on national television.,10
"Good excellent amazing, i liket i lot. I will see it again",10
"I just watched The Shawshank Redemption and I probably should let my mind sleep on it before I write anything. However, I can't wait, this movie is so powerful I don't know how I lived all those years that I've wandering throughout this reality and I've never watched this masterpiece before. So, let's go back to the purpose of this review... Write about the movie, Shawshank is a movie about hope, about how someone can fight all the adversities that life can throw at them and get up with a smile on their face, how you can stay strong when everything seems so dark, how you can learn with the worst of the experiences. I gotta be honest, I'm pretty bad at writing in English(My first language is Portuguese) but I had to say something. I wasn't sure about watching The Shawshank Redemption but I'm so glad that I didn't listen to my unreasonable prejudices about old movies. I had seen a lot of wonderful old movies, and still, my mind has those setbacks with them. So, to bring an end to my review I just have one more thing to say ""I urge you to watch The Shawshank Redemption, you won't regret that choice."" ^⁻^/",10
"Before watching this movie , I red the script and it was as good as the movie which I watched 1 year after it . I now believe ""Alfred Hitchcock"" was right by bringing this fact that "" any good movie has 3 things . A good scrip , a good script and a good script """,1
In my opinion the greatest film ever made. Exquisite in every detail with Morgan Freeman's silky smooth narration taking you along on an unforgettable journey..,10
"This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character.

The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.",10
Truly the best movie I have ever watched. Will watch it again and again!,10
"This film is a profound impression of truth regarding friendship and solidarity. The men are simple folk who are enslaved by thugs like wardens and guards with one credo: you can battle the entire world but you never betray a friend. We learn what happens to friends, to foes and the principles of a man's life,

The film is about relationships; the many years a man spends away from society and garners new friends. The film, like life and memories, unfolds in non-linear fashion. The director's cuts are interesting and each scene is beautifully amplified . The story is not told deceptively. Instead, the chapters of the story are revealed like pieces of a great jigsaw puzzle. Each delicious piece might make us laugh or cry or smile or feel hatred for the racist 'man'.

This film is a true masterpiece, expressing a profound statement about friendship and betrayal, with fantastic acting, writing, directing and music.",10
"Beautifully narrated ane executed on many levels. Gone, so I thought, were the days when a movie could completely captivate an audience on dialogue alone. Thank you for this masterpiece.",9
"One of the best movies ever seen, you cannot imagine the details and every step in the movie is almost ideal.",10
"Love all of the actors. The was Morgan Freeman narrates this title shows his greatness as a voice over actor.The visual work in this movie is also spectacular. Being set in a prison it feels gloomy and dark. However, when it transforms into the lush green country outback you really get a sense of how visually a film effects you as an audience. Tis is a brilliant movie that must be respected.",10
This movie worth to be on the top beautiful story beautiful performance 10 out of 10 overall rating,9
"I can't tell you anything because the beauty of a movie is watching it, if you're reading this and haven't watched it you're messing on one of the best experiences that the cinema can offer",10
One of the best stories about perseverance and friendship in times of despair. A must watch.,10
"This movie is called in Korea ""Shawshank escape."" At the first time I thought this is a normal thriller. However, This movie is amazing.

It awakened me!! I hope all of you guys watch the movie.

the movie is so electrifying that I purchased the poster.

This is my movie of life.",1
"I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yeah",10
This piece of art is so close to my heart. I think no other movie will get to this level of perfectness.,10
"One of the best movies I have had the chance to watch a movie and enjoy it. The cast, the acting and above all the story line was phenomenal. The producer and the directors must get a heads up for writing such a great story, so realistic and dramatic that I watched it twice.This is a much watch movie for every adult and I guarantee the suspense and end of the movie will shock you",10
"First thing you need to see this movie is real patience. I am not kidding. This movie will test your patience. Story moves real slow but if you watch it completely, it's real worth it.",10
"I simply cannot understand why this film is so highly regarded. I wanted to watch it because it had such a good write-up, was long, had great actors and sounded interesting. And it was... relatively interesting. But probably a slightly better than average film. Like 'The Green Mile' it should have been better. It was not emotional or harrowing enough. There was some silly part of the film that descended into a fiscal documentary!!!? 'Patch Adams' is much better. The most interesting theme was that prisoners become totally institutionalised and there were some good moments but overall it was a bit too clichéd. It would have been better with a more satisfying finale and a cracking, string-led score from James Horner or Hans Zimmer.",10
"The most awesome movie. Which I have ever seen. The fair first Place in the ranking. In general, King's films have a completely mystical filling. Not like everyone else. In his childhood he re-read all of King. In the wild Delighted. This is a real topic. I advise everyone to watch!",10
"This is my first review and what other to start with than the shawshank redemption. The first time I watched it i was amazed at how much I could love a movie. The acting is just so superb, the story is what kept my eyes glaring at the screen for nearly 2 and a half hours. It truly is a masterpiece of a film and people will still be talking about it for decades.",10
"Loved it.it""s a good movie. recomand...............",10
This is my favorite movie of all time. This movie is the best everyone have to watch this.,10
I like the superficial subjects has to choose for his films,10
I watched this movie just after I watched The godfather. I had heard a lot about godfather but I didn't like it at all. But The Shawahank Redemption was great. I really loved it. And the funny thing is that I had never heard about The Shawshank Redemption. But when I searched the top 100 greatest movie of all time I found this movie at the second place right after The godfather. Then I decided to watch it and I really enjoyed every minute of the movie.,10
"Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins stand like poets, and they just enchant us with their beautiful story and poetry! Yes, now after watching the movie, you know or remember again- hope is the best of all things, and when you hope, you know the meaning of life.",10
"Wonderful, amazing, glorious, are three words to describe this masterpiece. The acting was good, and the plot better. This film shows us the strength of the human spirit, true friendship and especially what we all crave, desire and trustWonderful, amazing, glorious, are three words to describe this masterpiece. The acting was good, and the plot better. This film shows us the strength of the human spirit, true friendship and especially what we all crave, desire and trust",10
The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job!,10
I cried while watching this amazing movie A great cast A great story A grat movie,10
I cried while watching this movie....a great story..a great cast...a great movie,10
"This is the Movie which is Far Better than Cinema. an Flawless performance from all the Actors. What a lovely Script. One of the greatest Movies Ever. Director is awesome, his Vision is like a real world making. No Flaws in the film. This was the Experience which takes me to the different level. i am speechless. just one word God of all Films",10
'Now i know why its the number one move ever made!,10
"One of The Best Movie,From the begining no one could think what will happen. But suddenly a different think happend and this cost this movie a huge interact with audience.Every people love it because of finishing moment it tha givens to us.",10
"Movie is Very Much Recommended and has amazing characters, story and punches.",10
Superb depth if you understand the meaning of freedom and friendship...!,10
When i started watching the movie i really felt that it would be some boring stuff but the it snatched me inside it which made me realize the depth of movie and the real meaning of freedom and friendship...!,10
"Like so many reviews said before: BEST MOVIE EVER if you compare it to Marvel Movies and Ben Stiller Comedies. But it's a nice watch, really well made, well written. It's ok. I get why people still go crazy about big classics like 2001, Godfather, much of the Hitchcock & Orson Welles filmography, Star wars... but i seriously couldn't find any of the bold cinematic qualities I thought made a movie a classic in this one.",1
i watched this movie in 2008 and i still have not forgotten about it. this means this movie was so good it has been embedded in my brain. I am amazed at how the movie was shot. story line and cinematography was the highlight for me. what better way to tell a story about prison break... simply Amazing.,9
Love this movie and watched so many times. truly a timeless classic.,7
I really feel like this was a great movie it showed how jealous could over take anyone and cause them to murder their wife and their wife's lover and i'm not saying it's right but in a jealous rage of anger i feel that anyone with extremely high emotional problems would lead to killing someone's spouse and their lovers.,10
Loved how true this movie was to the original story.,10
"Print Page

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.

The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.",10
"I would just like to begin by saying the Shawshank redemption is one of the worst movies I have ever seen despite it being number 2 in the IMDb top 250 list. As I went through the movie, it was so painful, boring and everything else which makes a boring movie, unbelievably slow movie. I am aware of the fact that most people had voted this movie as an ace movie but in my opinion it was the single worst movie i have ever encountered with. Although I admire the 1 actor in the movie I am sad to say that for me this movie is a waste of time. I regret ever watching it. However I would not be able to say ""do not watch this movie"" as the voting and the scores point otherwise. In my opinion the Shawshank Redemption should not even be on the 1-10000 list of the movies. It was just someone going into prison and making a difference. I am all for inspirational movies, just not this one. I would rather sit and stare into a blank spot rather than wasting my time watching this movie. No offense to the actors as they were not bad but the script, the story, the screenplay, the time period, nothing suited each other. I am just expressing how i feel about this movie and my final words to describe this movie: ""DO NOT WATCH"".",9
"this movie changed my life...its very emotional,motivating,inspiring...and makes me feel grateful...it will be stay in my heart forever...i don't think any other movie can take place of this movie even in future...there's not enough words to express my emotions...and i cant explain anymore...",6
"pair two of the best actors of our time (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) with one of the best writers of ALL time (Steven King) and what do you expect? one of the greatest pieces of film of all time...my only complaint is the length of the film, but for what you get, it is well worth it...one of the most moving, powerful films i've ever seen, Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career, and Morgan freeman is near his best from beginning to end, i never lost interest in ""shawshank redemption"", and there was never a time i didn't care what was happening to any character...although it is very constrained in environment, it gives the viewer the sense of freedom and independence among the inmates, despite their confinement by far one of the most emotional and moving films i've ever seen, i've rarely felt so deep for the characters in a movie",10
"This movie is from other world, nothing more to say",10
"Yes, This is the one of the best Movie ever what i seen... The characters, the story, the idea, its all a very good performance.

You need to watch this Movie if you not seen yet!",7
"Yes, this is the one of the best Movie Ever what i seen... More movile lik this!",10
"Brilliant direction, all characters perfectly matched with script, especially Red always ultimate.. till i search this type of movie, but can't find it..",10
"Wow nice film, i loved it so much The Shawshank Redemption is true example about film-making",10
Just the masterpiece . The game of actors is so high level. Very sad that now we cant watch something like The Shawhank. Everything in this movie is perfect . Anything remarks . Thanks for this movie Frank Darabont and all actors,9
"I love this movie, certainly one of my favorites, both surprising and captivating. Films like these are becoming increasingly scarce. His director is once more overflowing with imagination and the end of the film is extraordinary. I advise those who have not yet seen it. But it would surprise me ^^",10
"This Film is a Masterpiece; Personally I think this is the greatest film of all time, The Acting is great, Thomas Newmans Musical Score is terrific, one of Morgan Freeman's best performances and the villain (The Warden) is really good one of the top movie Villains ever. I have no negatives with this movie and that is extremely rare and I tried to look for a negative and I couldn't find one with this Film. Best Stephen King adaptation Film to date and check this Film out if you haven't seen it.",6
A real production that deserves to be the best film in the world I am happy to be free,10
IT IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN JUST THE END TWIST AND THE BEGINNG WHICH TOLD US IT I A SERIOUS MOVIE,10
The Shawshank Redemption is in my opinion the most Overrated film in history. With the highest IMDb rating ever it confuses me why people like it so much. It's a fine movie but not the Greatest Ever. Morgan freedman's performance is Alright wildly Overrated It's hard to believe this is the best. I've watched this movie 3 times each time I was disappointed with literally Everything. With such an iconic legacy for a movie I don't understand what people love about this Film it's just not Great. The film should be fantastic with a Amazing Cast all around I don't understand how this film truly flops so badly.,10
"A story of justice. A person, imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, finally escapes, starting a new life for himself.

Brutal in places, portraying the life inside a tough American prison, this film has it all. It's a story of friendship, with possibly the greatest ending of all time. A must for all movie fans.",10
"Excellent movie! I've seen it for several times but I can't stop watching it. It's memorable! The actors play is magnificent! Hope is what we need most! Redemption is just a word like every other word. In a corrupt system, hope never dies. Andy is not only just a smart guy. He takes advantage of the whole corrupt system. There were and there will always exist innocent people in jail. How you can prove your innocence is a matter of common sense which is not evenly distributed. Hope is always needed as long as corruption never end. When hope dies, everything else dies slowly. And in the end a question: what would one like Andy do not in 1966, but in 2006. Could he still get into prison, could he still escape, could he still take financial advantage over the system? I hope he could!",10
"And one of the saddest in the world! Andy really had a hard time of it. This is one of those films where I always wonder if I got stuck in jail what would my life be like? What exactly would I do? How would I live and how exactly would I survive. The only current TV show that brings back those emotions is Orange is the New Black. Feeling isolated and stuck.

The breath of this film can be summed up in a few ways but most of the human spirit and the will to survive against all odds. Hope is the answer and name of the game in this film. Trying to control your surroundings even though control is the least you have.",10
"I don't care what part it is on or if it just stopped playing and restarted, once this movie is playing it is impossible to not sit down and watch it. It's not my favorite movie of all time but it sure is the most watchable movie of all time. If there was a channel that played this movie non stop 24/7 and didn't run credits the human race would be doomed. It would steadily collect the entire populace and without a way to escape its beautiful clutches we would perish. Borderline flawless in execution. If it was based on a space station it would be my favorite movie, but then it wouldn't be what it is. Perfect.",10
"I loved this movie! It was smart, clever, and brings you inside behind the wall. The actors are brilliant, the writing was awesome! I highly recommend you see this movie!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a film about life in the American Shawshank prison, where corruption among guards and directors plays a major role. Andy Dufresne, a banker, is sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover. However, he maintains that he was innocent. In Shawshank, after a difficult start, he becomes his fellow prisoners. One of them is Red, the narrator of the story, who is charmed by the huge cleverness of Andy. If Andy asks Red if he can come to a geologist hammer, Red, who has the size of the laundry, will deliver this hammer to Andy. The contact flourishes",9
"Wow, been a few years. I'm editing my old post. I'd like to humbly thank everyone here for rating my flick so highly. #1, huh? Providing the story for Shawshank Redemption was an imagination of myself under the short story's circumstances. It is similar to K-PAX that way and of the same vintage. Having been a business major at Georgia Tech, it would be natural for me to help with estate planning, taxes, and accounting had I been taken prisoner. The inside out program of public works and attendant graft, corruption, intimidation and murder was my way of encouraging scrutiny of similar programs nation-wide. I had been Postmaster of the Georgia State Senate at 21, so that is why the State Senate was written instead of the more common oracles, say the Maine Governor's office or other organs of government and foundations. The Mozart duet wasn't of my choosing, but it's generally acknowledged as among the most beautiful pieces of music ever written, so that choice was a no-brainer. I would have preferred the flute solo from Orpheus, but that's just me. I purposefully decided against another loathsome portrayal of racial casts that were very common at that time, so as not to 'date' the picture and to influence viewers toward tolerance even in intolerable circumstances. Against opposition, I gave the important Red character to an African-American actor. (In the short story Red had been an Irishman.) At the time, that dimmed prospects for box office success, but given that the flick is now well- received, emulation has led to further improvement. When we did this one in 1988ish, in Syracuse, New York, I was attending graduate school of medicine at SUNY-upstate and working in Max Mozell's lab. At about the same time, I did dozens of films and won many Oscars for the various ghost writers. (Gladiator, Good Will Hunting, Cast Away, Mystic River, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Enemy at the Gates, Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, Vanilla Sky, A Beautiful Mind, Forrest Gump, The Matrix films, The Bourne films, National Treasure films, Pirates of the Caribbean films, Avatar, Titanic, Lost in Translation, UP, ). The name of the Mexican town on the seashore was conveyed to me by my old friend, Frank Arnold, who was Zawataneo (sp?) on vacation while in medical school. He spelled it for me over the phone while the 'creative team' and I worked out the flick's details. Since then, the town has boomed, an unexpected gift to Mexico. I set this one in Maine, to de-stigmatize inflexible regional prejudices then current. It seems to have worked. Michael Meyers figured me out, this flick is part of the series designed to change the world, save the planet, and bring the human race closer to God Almighty.",10
Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies,10
"May be one of the best movies of cinema history. But for television audience. Not for cinema audience. You can watch that movie on TV always. But one in time in movie theater is enough, not second time. It'a not a The Godfather or The Dark Knight..

I have seen many movies. And I have my personal Top 1000 list, like IMDb. And this movie set on the first 50, but not on first 10 or 20. I have seen twice that movie on DVD, but only one time in cinema. On the other hand, I have seen The Matrix 6 times, Braveheart 2 times, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy 10 times (whole three movies completely), Memento 2 times, The Dark Knight 3 times, and etc.. People likes that movie, but not adore..",10
this movie was one of my favorite movies ever since childhood. I used to watch it with my mom when I was younger and we would talk for hours about the ending. one of my favorite movie subjects has to be prison escape or escape in general. I love the suspense and frustration and the feeling you get when the protagonist finally comes up with a good plan and you really think he/she is going to do it and then the feeling after he/she does it and gets away with or doesn't.,10
The best lovie ever made! Morgan Freeman forever. A+++++++++,10
"basically the best film I've ever seen and if you haven't then you're missing out on a whole lot of pop culture references. from start to finish i'm an emotional wreck. every character is well developed and complex and honestly you don't find many films like this anymore. it's got some funny moments, some heartbreaking, and some painfully distressing ones, but the story is told in such a beautiful way you can't not like this film. sorry to be part of the hype, but it's the most highly rated film for a reason!",10
"This film Is one of my all time favorites. Talk about never giving up on hope. love the whole cast as well, such talented actors.",9
"Shawshank is simply one of the greatest American films ever made. ""Thick as theifs"". A tale of 2 men that become friends and endure quite gruesome hardships. Absolutely amazing film.",10
"Loved this one. Wonderful performance and hands-down filmmaking. Morgan Freeman was absolutely brilliant and Tim Robbins made his character look so real, it's impressive. It's a must watch for those who are done with the typical Hollywood movies. The cinematography and colouring is inspiring. We've been asked to learn from this film at our film school. Truly a pleasure to watch.",7
"The best film I've ever seen, better than the godfather in my opinion, come to think why if this has 9.2 and godfather has 9.1, why is godfather still top in the top 250 films. it doesn't work. But anyway back to the film, if you have not seen it, you have to definitely watch it!

If you do not see it before you die, you are missing out on possibly the best film you will ever see in your lifetime. i beg of anyone reading this watch this film, it is an actual masterpiece.",10
"Goonies is a never ending series of very loud, annoying and preposterous situations that will have you rolling your eyes more than a Felix the Cat clock. First and foremost, the continuous dialog and general noise in this movie is enough to make it a form of torture. The audio is pegged at 10 from the opening and never once lets up. Secondly, the gaps in reality: it's just a kids film you say? Movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars intelligently made a kids genre entertaining. Ditto to The Bad News Bears, Home Alone or anything Walt Disney Produced. This film bashes you over the head with every cliché and impossible situation imaginable. The characters are all one dimensional and unimaginative, most all of them have an adult wit and a snappy response for every thing posed to them like a kid from a bad sitcom, and I cannot stress this enough, all of them talk nonstop, mostly simultaneously, for the entire film.",9
This movie is such a heart felt movie and definitely something that will leave you thinking about yourself. This movie teaches you to persevere and keep going no matter how dark life gets to you; to look at the happy times in your most dark moments in life. A gut wrenching- screaming at the top of your lungs kind of movie.,10
I watched again and again. It is really a masterpiece.,10
"He Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.",8
"This was, put simply, the longest film I've ever seen. I've spent many an hour watching movies. Some of them were good. Some of them were bad. Some of them reached me so deep inside that I spent days afterward thinking about them. But the experience, watching the film itself, always lasted between one to four hours.

With ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" the experience lasted twenty years.

I wasn't bored. At first, I was skeptical about this film. Some movies which ranked high in the IMDb weren't worthy; for example, ""Batman Begins."" My skepticism was so strong that it prevented me from entering the film with awe. But after a while, I found myself completely immersed in Red's narrative.

It is useless to try and explain the experience of watching this film. But I can say one thing more.

This film was the first film that brought tears of joy to my eyes. I ended up smiling and then chuckling. And then I felt a streak of water run down my cheek. And I realized I just experienced the ultimate movie: the life story of people I wouldn't have known other wise, and as real and as good as it gets.",10
"I could watch The Shawshank Redemption, 10 times in the row... over and over again! OMG, what a movie!!!",9
"What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.",10
Great movie thats pne of my favorites and would reccommend to all,6
He greatest movie I have ever seen in my whole life,9
"Never ever lose a point versus any movies, both old ones and moderns! This is incredibly great.",9
Gf finally got me to watch this cause of family guy reference. great movie. best i have seen in a while,9
I think this movie is good but i see better ones. 3/5,9
"A memorable storyline along with one of the most breathtaking soundtracks ever written. Whether you are a fan of action, romance, or drama, this film will entertain you to the end.",8
"This film is awesome. I cried, laughed and learned a few things. The production was great and the cast was perfectly chosen. I took the kids to see this and they understood everything and also enjoy watching it with. I hope to see another film like this. I don't think a pt 2 is in the makes so I'll settle for another film something like it.",10
"I think the film is overvalued, but no doubt that it is one of the best, but there are other films with more than good acting and plot.",10
First i see this movie i will always se e the assasin and i very like it this is movie my first time movie i ever watch,10
"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is the most perfect movie I've ever seen, right from flawless acting and razor-sharp screenplay to an amazing background score. A lot of thought has gone into every scene and every scene flows smoothly into the next with no abrupt transitions. Though Andy Dufresne is the central character of the movie, the characters of Brookes and Red are also vital to the theme of the Shawshank Redemption. Scenes of brutal violence in the prison have the intended effect on the audience without being too gory.

One of the few movies that have driven home the power of hope so effectively, this is one movie that will lift your spirits in times of gloom.",9
I cant even summarise how much i hate this film its terrible have a bad day,9
"This movie was incredible, good story, good motivation and good act",5
"I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for.",7
"I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody.",10
It is one of my best movies i have seen in my life.,10
"This is such a spectacular and mysterious movie. The lead guy plays his role like a Loki.

I first saw this movie back in high school.

It was one of the best movies I seen during that time. The story with out a doubt was remarkable. It's filled with twists and what the heck moments.",10
"When the movie starts also starts your journey through what is pure in this life: friendship, hope, courage.

This movie is a piece of art from which everybody takes what they need. It gives us understanding of hard work which will be rewarded. It shows that true happiness is what we are working for all our life.

Isn't it wonderful, that true feelings and inspiration can visit us just by watching a movie? But don't be mistaking. You aren't just to watch the film. You have to receive it with your heart as much as you receive it with your head.

I guarantee that each of us will be smiling. Just like they did.",9
Great movie but my expectations were higher. I loved Law Abiding Citizen more.,10
"Még ma is nagyon jóféle film, érdemes megnézni a fiatalabbaknak is.",10
I think this movie adds really good emotion it is breath taking and overall very good film.,10
The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,10
"It does not deserve 9.3 rate! It is just a usual film. There is nothing uncommon. I cannot get, what people find here!",10
A story of freedom and friendship beyond concrete and bars.,10
"A movie worth watching, you should not miss, take 2h to see this movie offline, extremely attractive.",7
The story is about a banker (andy) innocently serving a life sentence of prison for the murder of his wife and all the incidents that come about in there. I really admired the character of andy who still has the hope of living in a free environment.His a very smart fella with lots of plans in mind about the future yet inside prison. Undoubtedly it is the best movie i have ever seen. The scenes are very delicately chosen. SO many intuitive points in this movie that i recommend multiple watch of it. I really liked the acting which was so natural.It was like a real story.I'm still amazed that why hasn't this movie received any Oscars. I thank the director for such a great movie.,2
He only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly,10
This movie taught me what hope is. Fear will hold you a prisoner. Use hope as a tool to liberate yourself. Hope will set you free from all your fears.,7
Definitely one of the best movies I've seen. You wont be disappointed,10

"Unfortunately, there isn't an option available to give this film a Rating of higher than 10. I remember as a child watching with awe Disney movies like the lion king and Aladdin and used to think it wont Get any better than this. Then as i matured i watched many more movies That again gave me that sense of happiness that i was fortunate enough To be able to experience such great movies in my life time. But quite soon, all these Hollywood movies started to seem quite stereotypical and quite run of the mill stuff. I used to think that Hollywood had lost its magic for me. Then came along this movie which I Watched 15 years after its release. I must admit that i watched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. And i was Skeptical of its quality, given the name was not too much of an eye Catcher plus the fact that it did not win any Oscars. How wrong i was! Hollywood has outdone itself once again. I could write a whole book on The greatness of this film, the acting, the direction, the soundtrack .. I mean it doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. I have seen both Forrest gimp and Pulp fiction which Truly are masterpieces on their own, i truly love those movies. But Really, its nothing short of a crime to not award the Shaw-shank Redemption the best movie of the millennium, let alone the best movie of The year. I guess the box office reception of this movie had something To do with it not winning the award. A must watch for anyone having an Iota of emotion and love for artistic work.",10
Best Movie about Prisons Life and Best Revenge I have Ever Seen ..,10
"This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. Definitely everyone should watch this movie. Super good acting, gripping storyline and exciting surprises in the movie.",10
"Is the best movie of all time. Not only for IMDb users, but also for other rewires. This movie has it all. Suspense, drama, comedy, tenderness, friendship, etc. The photography is also magnificent. The characters are the best actor in Hollywood at that time. An incredible Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The story is complete and has an spectacular ending. THe best ending the Hollywood made. This movie must win an Oscar, but unfortunately, Tom Hank's Forrest Gump, was more patriotic at that time and won the best picture Oscar. It is important to you don't miss this movie although you don't like prisons movie. So if you didn't see it, please rent it now. You wont regret.",10
Truly incredibly respectable from one of today's most rare and beautiful films,10
"Though its a long movie, its well worth every second. Daring and unique, this story is unlike any other. Expertly brought to life on screen, this is one of Stephen Kings best short stories.",10
A true classic. It had me so emotional. It was really a exceptional depiction of friendship and redemption between two men.,10
"This movie is clearly a weak copy of ""Escape from Alcatraz""(1979) The scene where Andy drops the grit is directly and without any effort from Frank Darabont to hide the fact that he has little fantasy, copied from Escape from Alcatraz. The sphere that is created in The Shawshank Redemption is meek whereas the sphere that is created in Escape from Alcatraz is thrilling and you can really feel the tension in the prison. The closed ending of this movie is for people, like Frank Darabont, that have little fantasy. The sublime open ending in Escape from Alcatraz leaves room for the viewer to fantasize on what happened to the prisoners.",10
"I really loved the Direction,Screenplay,Cinematography,colour Grading Every Single part was Amazingly done",10
"Cinematography,Direction,Sreenplay Each & Every Technical part was just Awesome",10
A great movie to remind society that their are people behind bars that are wrongfully accused,9
Cleary a top 5 film ever made this is a perfect example of when everything is done correctly,10
"This movie is one of the best book to movie adaptation I have witnessed. The script, the music, the camera angles, the acting, all brilliantly making the viewer feel connected with the characters and the story. Full marks for this movie.",10
"You know the story of this movie is one of the best stories I have ever seen and the actors , they really feel what character are they playing the rules and else.the way that play the movie you feel what they are feeling like happiness anxious or other things",10
"One off my favorite films, plus a big big inspiration for why I do what I do. Awesome movie.",7
Just want to applaud the cast and crew. The work they did was really great. You could tell they put a lot of work into this,10
"I feel like I appreciate it more than before. Don't get me wrong, PLEASE. There are great performances as well as remarkable characters, and the plot is as pleasurable as its dialogue and pacing, but it's 142 minutes of self-indulgence and you rarely have to fear for the fate of your characters. It's a feel good movie and you can watch and rewatch as many times as possible. It's still not my favourite Frank Darabont's and I dream every day of a version made by Rob Reiner, who also has great adaptations by Stephen King.",5
"Amazing movie

story telling was really really good acting is fantastic whitout them the movie would be less good directing is really good

i give it a 9.5/10",9
I really love this movie specially when i watch this movie i am in a different zone.,10

This is by far SK best film adaptations! A true American Classic!,10
"Inspirational.

Get busy living or get busy dieing.....

From the richness of supporting actors to the lead roles this is the most complete drama film anyone would lucky enough to find on there own like i did on one evening in the video store. A Tour de Force from Castlerock, Frank Darabont, Tim, and Morgan Freeman.

A path a passage call it what you will, this is what film for me is all about, depth colour emotion and the strangest thing is...it just doesn't happen with guys?...

Well i was spellbound and shocked at the ending, and then looked after by the director as they completed the film on the beach in Mexico.

A truly wonderful film, worthy of not just the Oscar nominations but the all the Oscars themselves. To be taken on a the most wonderful of cinematic journeys......This is what we all dream of.

Frank Darabont, Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Stephen King's Finest Hour.

Exceptional 10/10",8
"This movie is awesome. It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into",9
The movie is brilliant. Acting on point. Morgan Freeman is outstanding and should have won an oscar. Tim Robbims character is one smart and patient cat. Moving. Some parts shocking. Makes you think. And corruption is ongoing. Justice.,10

"The best film,very nice.touching story of life, which is very well shown on the screen.",10
"Days passes, locked behind the doors.Hopes blinking throughout. Fear of consciousness. Shawshank Redemption will be iconic for the entire society.",10
This movie was great. I saw it quite a few times and it is very interesting. A must see. I know I loved it:),10
"No, I refuse to understand why this undoubtedly very good film is considered by many to be the best of the best. I would not be surprised if this film was in the top ten, but I can not accept the fact that for people this particular topic is the main one. The theme of the film, in two words, is freedom and hope. Indeed, these are the most important concepts in life, but I reviewed this film many times, and with all my desire I could not say after the credits that this movie revealed these words in full. The popularity of this film, or rather not even popularity, but a high rating and high ratings, is primarily due to the herd instinct. That's all.

I do not agree that the theme of freedom should be shown precisely on the example of a prison. It can be shown like this, but then I can't call it brilliant, and the rating obliges me to do it. But I will never say that this movie is the best.

All those who consider the topic of release from prison the most relevant for themselves, have you all been sitting there? They will answer me: 'meaning inner freedom' and all that. But nevertheless, you consider the prison-themed film to be the best film about freedom... The film 'Braveheart' reveals this concept much deeper and more extensively, but the struggle for the freedom of an entire nation is apparently placed lower than this very struggle of a single person.

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that I am by no means trying to criticize the film as a project. I just want to say that he should not be in the first place in the rankings.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story at all as many think. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.",10
"Masterpiece! The flow of images, acting, lighting, music.. all perfectly alligned. A harmonious balance of powerful storytelling!",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic of American cinema that tells the story of two inmates, Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyce, who form a close bond while serving time in the Shawshank State Penitentiary. From the very beginning, it is clear that this will be a deeply moving and emotionally powerful film, as we are introduced to the characters and their respective circumstances.

One of the things that stands out most about The Shawshank Redemption is its incredible cast of actors, who deliver some of the most memorable and nuanced performances of their careers. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are particularly standout as Andy and Ellis, respectively, and their on-screen chemistry is electric.

The film's narrative is also incredibly well-written, with a compelling story that keeps us engaged and invested throughout. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that explores the human experience in a way that is both universal and deeply personal, and it is this combination of compelling characters and a well-crafted story that makes it such a timeless and enduring classic.

In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a film that should not be missed. It is a masterpiece of American cinema that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who sees it. If you have not yet had the pleasure of experiencing this film, I highly recommend that you seek it out as soon as possible. It is an experience that you will not soon forget.",10
"One of the last places you would expect to see a movie about hope and the deep bonds of friendship takes place in a prison. This drama is a worthy top 100 film, and I believe that is where it will stay for many years to come. There is a fair amount of explicit language throughout the movie, so for those that cannot tolerate language, this may ruin the redeeming qualities of the movie for you.

One quality I look for in a good movie is to get lost in the film, to the point that I begin to feel the emotions of characters. Here you will find a bit of everything, hopelessness, hope, love, and anger. Put it this way, if I had only three movies to pick to watch the rest of my life, this would be one. If there was a reading rainbow list for movies, then I would highly suggest you pick up a copy and watch this movie. Hope you enjoy",10
I thank its amazing movie that have a moral issues and interesting story about the life in prison,9
This is a great movie ... The text of the script was very effective Hope to live..... ......,10
Its a must watch movie.. I just love it... The actors have done justice to their characters and you can feel it while watching the movie... I would recommend this movie to each one of all...,4
"I always remember this film, especially the storyline when the main character of this film shows amazing performance and emotion.",10
Andy may well have been crawling through unspeakable filth in that pipe,10
"Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner.",10

"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.",10
This is the best movie I have ever watched and advise everyone to watch! Hope and there is nothing else,9
"This is the best movie ever but I give you 15 Things You May Not Have Known About The Shawshank Redemption

1. It's Based on a Novella by Stephen King The film is based on Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" which was published in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films, Stand By Me in 1986 and Apt Pupil in 1998. Only one of them, ""The Breathing Method,"" has not been turned into a movie.

2. It's Similar to Tolstoy King's novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy called ""God Sees the Truth, But Waits."" Both are about men sent to prison for murders they didn't commit.

3. Director Frank Darabont Got a Good Deal on the Rights to King's Story He bought the rights from King for $1.

4. It Almost Had a Much Different Cast Castle Rock Entertainment, the studio that made Shawshank, was co-founded by Rob Reiner—director of another King adaptation, Stand By Me—and is named after the mythical Maine town that provides the setting for many of King's books. After director Frank Darabont pitched Shawshank to the studio, Reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star Tom Cruise as Andy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red.

5. The Original Title Was Changed to Avoid Confusion Darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to Castle Rock Entertainment. He decided to drop the ""Rita Hayworth"" part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a Rita Hayworth biopic. During the casting process, Darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodel; he swore the script was the best she had ever read and that she'd be perfect for the (non-existent) part of Hayworth.

6. It Was Filmed in Ohio Although the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The structure was slated to be torn down, but the production delayed the demolition for a year. After the film wrapped, all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building, which were preserved for historical purposes.

7. Morgan Freeman Got Really Good at Catch The scene where Andy first approaches Red about the rock hammer as Red plays catch in the main yard took nine hours to shoot. Freeman continued to play catch for the whole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with his arm in a sling.

8. The Film Was Inspired by Goodfellas Darabont says his main source of inspiration was Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas because of its use of voice-over narration and editing techniques.

9. Voiceovers Are Tricky Business Originally, all of Morgan Freeman's voice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. The fact that much of it syncs up to the on screen action (see: the scene on the roof where the inmates drink beer) isn't simple editing. Darabont would playback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors to specifically play off of the audio. But the audio quality of his voice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss, so Freeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production.

10. They Got Lucky with One of the Most Famous Scenes Every take of the film's signature shot of Tim Robbins raising his arms outstretched in the rain after Andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the one in the film. It was the final take shot for that scene.

11. The Prop Guy Was a Jokester The visual joke of Andy's rock hammer being tucked into the Bible right after the first page of the Book of Exodus came from the film's prop master Tom Shaw.

12. None of the Close-up Shots of Andy's Hands or Feet are Tim Robbins They're director Frank Darabont.

13. Stephen King's Red Was Changed for the Film In the original novella, Red is described as a middle-aged Irishman.

14. The Mug Shot of Young Red Isn't Morgan Freeman It's actually a photo of his son.

15. The Tree Where Red Finds Andy's letter Isn't in Fort Hancock, Texas It's in Ohio's Malabar Farm State Park.",10

One of the best movies ever made! I have watched this movie at least a 100 times. Very inspiring,10

CHAR THE SHAWSHARK REDEMPTION IS AN AWESOME MOVIE BEACUSE IT HAS SHARKS AND IT REDEMPST. WHY DO I HAVE TO COMMENT TO THIS THING JUST LIKE WHY IM SO TIRED,10
"This movie is the one of the best movies in the world.

Etc. Imdb forcibly writted this to me.

I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.",10
"This has to be one of the all time greats of the movies. The amazing story-line and the brilliant acts by Time Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me speechless and emotional in the end. Morgan Freeman's narrations at regular intervals are always triggering something inexpressible...

The story teaches us many things like the difficulty of prison life, the desperation of those prisoners for their freedom and the abundance of 'TIME' they have in contrast to the out-side-world, etc.

From the beginning to the very end, this sensitive movie does attach the viewers to it and, I must say, such movies are very rare in numbers, specially nowadays.",10
I ALWAYS WATCH IT AND IT CAME TO SLEEP I WAKE HAVING DREAMS ABOUT THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT AND NOT ONLT I WAS IN IT MAKING MY OWN DECSIONS IT GAVE ME ROOM TO INVENT MY OWN PERSON,9
"From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying '.""

The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?

People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about ""redemption"" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business (its $18 million original gross didn't cover costs; it took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar nominations, including best picture).

There wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a ""prison drama"" and women don't like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Clearly this was a movie that needed word-of-mouth to find an audience, and indeed business was slowly but steadily growing when it was yanked from theaters. If it had been left to find its way, it might have continued to build and run for months, but that's not what happened.",10
"I am new to commenting on movies, so maybe I shouldn't have started with trying to put the Shawshank Redemption into words. The themes of hope, depression, friendship, greed, and triumph connect with the best acting I have ever seen in a movie. The actors are so good, you begin to look at Morgan Freeman in real life as ""Red"" and Tim Robbins as ""Andy"". The humor is ever present, such as conversations held by the inmates. But perhaps the very best thing for an average viewer is the constant surprises. I'm not talking about monsters jumping from trees, I'm talking about how every time the movie starts to seem to get slow BAM! something happens that represents one of the themes. If you have not seen this movie, maybe because the fact that it is a ""prison movie,"" or maybe because it is now eleven years old, you have missed out on a life experience. It is my favorite movie of all time and always will be. The 9.1 rating on IMDb is so well earned and underrated.",10
Good overall definitely but I don't think one should expect too much. Still i would recommend it.,10

"Really this is one of those movies that can make me cry, be touched, believe in something, believe in human's ability to live, human's desire to live. The movie is truly a masterpiece and it is impossible to remake the second one.",10
"This is one of the best dramatic-Mysterious Film of the Century.

Directed by Frank Darabont and released in 1994, this film has stood the test of time and continues to be regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made.

Based on Stephen King's novella, the film tells the poignant tale of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a young banker who is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Within the confines of this brutal and corrupt prison, Andy befriends Red (played by Morgan Freeman), a seasoned inmate known for his resourcefulness and wisdom. Their unlikely friendship becomes the heart and soul of the narrative, weaving a profound and inspiring tale of resilience, friendship, and the indomitable human spirit.

The film's greatest strength lies in its ability to delve deep into the complexities of the human experience, exploring themes of hope, determination, and the quest for freedom. The script, penned by Darabont himself, is a work of art, striking a perfect balance between heart-wrenching moments and subtle humor. The dialogue is rich with meaning, and every line is delivered with remarkable conviction by the talented ensemble cast.

Tim Robbins delivers an outstanding performance as Andy Dufresne, infusing the character with a quiet strength and unwavering determination. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red is nothing short of remarkable, as he effortlessly embodies the role of a wise and observant inmate. Their chemistry is palpable, and their nuanced performances bring depth and authenticity to the story.

The film's cinematography, by Roger Deakins, is visually stunning, capturing the bleakness of prison life juxtaposed with moments of transcendent beauty. The deliberate use of lighting and shadows creates a haunting atmosphere, perfectly complementing the narrative's tone.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" boasts a masterful pace, keeping viewers engaged throughout its nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime. The unfolding of the story is expertly crafted, with every twist and turn leaving a lasting impact. As the plot unravels, the film explores the intricate dynamics of prison life, shedding light on the corruption and power struggles that exist within the system.

However, what truly sets this film apart is its unwavering message of hope. Despite the harsh realities of prison life, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" portrays the resilience of the human spirit and the possibility of redemption in the most unlikely of circumstances. It reminds us that no matter how dark life may seem, there is always a glimmer of hope that can lead to a brighter future.

With its exceptional performances, profound storytelling, and enduring themes, it remains an unforgettable cinematic experience that resonates with audiences of all generations.

"So many of my friend's and acquaintances frequently mentioned about this movie to me,they always said that this is the best movie out here but I never gave a try to watch this cause I thought ""Shawshank redemption"" would be a boring art filim inside prison casting old men .Until one day night I gave it a try .The movie was extraordinary , it's a classic movie which has been presented to the audience in a very simple but in a elegant manner ,the cast combining Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins helped this movie to reach at the apex point in the Hollywood industry . This movie has really touched my soul and it affected me in a very good way. I have to say "" you gotta watch this movie before you die , you will never regret watching Shawshank redemption. I know there won't be a single person in the world who won't love Shawshank redemption.10/10",10
"The best story of a good friendship I have ever seen. The way the story develops is unbelievebly well done. The cast is sublime at delivering top of the bill acting. I was left speechless throughout the whole last hour and left crying and laughing from ear to ear at the final scene.

If I could score it higher than 10/10 I would.",10
If you die before watch that this means you're in full of sin,9
"This movie is very inspirational. It shows the sad reality of life but the movie managed to give HOPE for the viewers. I love this movie. If IMDb rated this 9.3, i don't think that 9.4 even exists.",10
Every little thing in this film is perfect. Every scene has a message to everyone. I don't even think that the word 'MASTERPIECE' best describes Shawshank Redemption. This is the best of the bests movies of the world.,4
Good movie..seen multiple times can be watched and u wont be bored.,8

"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that deserves its place among the great films of all time. With a 9 out of 10 rating, this movie is a must-watch for any movie lover. The storyline is captivating and keeps you on the edge of your seat, while the characters are richly drawn and bring depth to the film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver powerhouse performances that are sure to stay with you long after the credits roll. The themes of hope, friendship, and perseverance are expertly woven into the fabric of this movie, making it a truly uplifting and inspiring experience. If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, do yourself a favor and watch it today.",10
"The score was magnificent, which is no surprise seeing as it was by Thomas Newman, and the direction by Frank Darabont was masterful, especially considering this was his first film.",10
"This is by far the best character drama I have seen. The acting is believable and powerful, the shots are perfectly framed, the story is interesting and keeps you hooked, and the comedy, while in short supply, is appropriately dark. Andy Dufresne is a relatable protagonist, and thus it is easy to connect with his struggles, and understand how he feels about being thrown into the life of a convicted criminal. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give us incredible performances, along with everyone else in the movie. On top of that, the ending is one of the best ever put on screen. I would recommend this film to everyone who likes the industry, and consider it a must-see cinematic classic.",4
"If you didn't watch 'The Shawshank Redemption', you didn't know 'Cinema'. There's nothing more to say !",10

"Personally I do not think this title deserves a spot on the first place of the top 250 movies list, but it was an enjoyable feel good movie nonetheless.",10
"Every speech in this movie is valuable and instructive My quote from this movie -- ""Get busy living or get busy dying.""A strange love works when you see this movie!.The best movie I have seen in my life💖💖💖 One of the best movies I have ever seen, which inspired me. This was an awesome movie by Frank Darabont. The movie was nominated for an Oscar but did not win. But it is the number one movie in the world. But only to high thinking people. It is a very boring movie for common thinking people. Its is one of the greatest Movie of all time but i think reporter only know IMDB for sure...who told that this is the no 1 movie in history. For Reporter you have to look on all Movie rating site then you are puzzled which 1 is the best. Good Luck : 😁",10

"This is a great movie with a great storyline and tremendous performances. The movie is best viewed in the television edited version because it is a story for the whole family if the language and unnecessary sexual scenes are omitted. I have spent many Sunday mornings watching this movie on TNT. I was totally shocked when we rented the movie for a trip and watched the unedited version.

Morgan Freeman is wonderful as usual. Tim Robbins plays his part perfectly although he does not appear to possess the physical attributes necessary in some parts of the film. The plot develops with perfect timing and the music works well with the time, location and story. It is a movie that can be seen over and over again due to its timeless plot.",10
I liked it in an aspect but was enjoyable to the end,10
"Accountability for the crimes we commit comes often at great cost, in this masterpiece, absolutely true.

This film is gut punching, heart breaking and warming.

A MUST SEE.",9
This is one of the best mind changing and super conceptual movies seen so far! A big thumbs up for the makers of this amazing The Shawshank Redemption!,8
It is one of the best movie if this isn't best the no one best. First I thing it's kind of boring movie but when I saw it this suprise me. It has very good and inspirational movie. I'll e this movie. A movie must to see,9
"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. I won't spend much word on this movie to justify how classic movie is this. Worth a watch many times.",10
"A great example for that wither leaf which can grow from the depth of darkness but with hope it grows tall and find it's way toward lights, this is a great motivational plot with extraordinary planning in order to escape from the prison, shout out to to morgan freeman.",1
One of the best films I've ever seen. Great inspiration from everyone. Shows life how it was . Even when life's that bad you don't have to have it that way. Great star Morgan Freeman . Plays a character RED which is heart warming. There are some sad times of the feature but it wouldn't be a box smash without all kinds of genre included. Such a great script and great camera work. I love the fact Andy is a nobody then becomes the highlight of the prison for putting his foot down and stepping up to the mark that everyone else was to scared to cross. Great plot. I have seen this over double figures and still see new bits as its a lengthy film,4
A masterpiece! A movie you will never forget! The best storyline and the best actors!,5
"Great movie, a must watch. This is a about freedom and hope.",8
"This is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen. This is a great story about one man's struggle for hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceptional as you really begin to feel for their characters. Every time I see this movie, I have to smile at the ending, and in a way I'm shocked, even though I know what's going to happen. All in all, a great viewing experience, and #2 on my list of the greatest movies of all-time.",10
"For a simple story which can be described in two or three sentences, the emotional impact this film has is surprising. 'The Shawshank Redemption' follows the maturation of a friendship over a thirty-year period, during which two men grow close in a cruel and brutal prison in New England. Based on a story by Stephen King, that author whose work has inspired such cheesy screen fare such as 'Thinner' and 'Needful Things', the film comes as a surprise. I had always though Forrest Gump was a great movie until I saw Shawshank. One of the strongest thoughts I had after seeing this film was that we, as a society, are wrong to sentence a man to endless years in prison. A controversial view, but it makes sense when compared to the world in the film. Hope, friendship, and an unwillingness to be broken are the main messages in a story that is beautifully filmed and flawlessly acted. Tim Robbins did deserve an Academy Award much more than Tom Hanks did, and I was disappointed to see that even Morgan Freeman's excellent turn as 'Red' slipped by Academy voters. Ah well, it's the same awards panel that gave the Best Picture nod to 'Titanic'. The world does not always make sense, 'Shawshank' teaches us. Bad things happen to good people, and it's who you are after the storm has passed that show us who, and what, we are.",8
the all-time #2 is WAY high for this flick. NO great acting performances(they're OK but not a miracle!!!!) the story lacks logic in parts and the final sequence is a little too much. very good movie to watch a must see anytime but NOT all-time #2,10
"I clearly remember reading the novel by Stephen King before the movie was even conceived. Yes, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb in this movie, as well as any supporting actor. And yes, Frank Darabont made a stunning work to transfer the story onto the screen, but to me Stephen King remains the real reason why this film is still the number one here on IMDb. Story and characters are magnificently powerful already on the book and the film director managed to follow every page slavishly.",10
"I am 14, and I saw this movie just an hour ago. Although I am naive and still a child, this movie was a great movie that makes you think. It is one of the(if not)great movies of all time.",10
"I want to say that this film is one of the best ever:THE REASON IS SIMPLE...........................ACTING IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are simply the BEST!!!!!!AS FOR FORREST GUMP.......................DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ""SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION""??????NO WAYYYYYYYYYY! FORREST GUMP IS A SIMPLE FRAUD!!!!!!!!TOM HANKS IS AWFUL,AND SO IS THE ENTIRE FILM...................",10
"I love this movie I guess that I have seen it over ten times,

I don't know what makes this movie good, but I must recommend it. When I was in the Video store I was very sceptical about it but that changed 10 minutes after I started the film. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.",10
"What can I say that hasn't already been said. Not much I suppose. The first time I saw this movie tears swelled in my eyes at the end, a sign that tells me that a movie is great. It has quickly moved to the #2 movie in my top ten list just behind Pulp Fiction. And even though Pulp Fiction is my favorite I think Shawshank should have won best picture. 4 out of 4 stars, two thumbs up and all that jazz. It gets better with repeated viewing too.",10
"This is good movie for retard, with censorship, of course and called 'Life in America', which is the opposite of what the mainstream media try to convince. The Americans waste, most of all, 'opportunities'... In one week, based in NY, I could make more money than the whole of Wall Street! The dictatorship of the dollar, must me upon us... ENT.",10
"Hope. It´s obviously ""the"" word that defines this movie. In fact, there´s five reasons that makes this film almost perfect.

1) An incredible fidelity to the original story by Stephen King 2) Great performances by both actors, Freeman and Robins. 3) A simply perfect ambientation 4) When you see it, you feel deep in your heart a new reason to live, no matter what 5) There´s nothing ""out of place"".

As Red, I hope this movie never dies. I hope that someday someone understands that is five million times better film than ""Forrest Gump"", his competitor on Oscar´s. I hope that Frank Darabont makes another film such as this. I hope you read this. I hope.",10
"Easily one of the best titles out there. It is a great mixture of comedy, drama, suspense, mystery, and basically any genre that you can mold into this! If you haven't seen it or wish to see it, then I would not wait any longer. This is a must-see of all movies. Morgan Freeman imposes a classic character that is recognizable in his other roles, but clearly deserves the most praise due to the immense hype over this film. Lost best picture only because of the other great movies in its year, but would have been a killer any other time. Saw a behind the scenes about it and director did not even think it would be this well received.",10
"It is a great movie .... a movie that opens up a new dimension every time one sees it . It has a message for you everytime you see it.

One can say it is a movie about hope against all odds . It is a movie about freedom .... of thought and action . You have to keep on hoping when there is darkness all around . But that is only on a spiritual plane . It is also an excellent prison movie with a convincing storyline and excellent performances from Robbins and Freeman . I think it is a must see for all ... not only once but many many times . And every time you will find it different.",8
"Kinda good, boring tho.

They talk too much and the protagonist is boring as f omg just shut up please I don't care about your bank gig or whatever. Would be much better if the was like zombies or vampires or something smh.",9
"You are going to need daily motivation to help you overcome all of the obstacles you will face in this line of work. This is the very moment when we feel discouraged and want to give up. This is very inspirational and motivational film,",10
"I don't know why so many people saying that this movie is not so very special. Maybe it's because they don't have seen it multiple times. This film gets bigger every time you watch it. I have watched this movie more than 10 times. And my opinion is that this is the greatest movie ever made, and that you have to go and see it. NOW!",10
"How many times have I seen this movie?God only knows! One thing is for sure though,apart from Dead Poets Society,this is the only film to still make me laugh,cry and when i've finished watching to somehow approach life in a more positive way. No.1 Film?I am no expert on cinema,i just know that people *need* to watch this film so that just for a little while all the s**t makes sense. Cheers for reading.",10
"I'm always simply out of words after watching this film. The score, the actors, the plot, everything just strikes me. I've seen this on DVD about five times now and it hasn't lost one bit of it's glory. If you haven't seen this film, see it now. If you saw it and didn't like it, maybe you should give it another chance.

I remember seeing it from TV when I was about 12 or 13. I Didn't really have any opinions about it then. It was good, but nothing special. I decided to buy the DVD anyway and after watching it 5 years later I finally got more deeper into the movie.

This is one of the best, if not best movie ever made. And I mean it.",10
"After seeing this movie a number of times, I felt time it was about time I commented on it. IMHO this is one of greatest movies of all time. It has been called a ""feel-good"" film but I disagree with this it is in fact a joyful movie. Its story acting, direction, location in fact everything are incredible. The movie touches a person on so many different levels; the hate for the ""sisters"", the sorrow and the joy for Andy, the beauty of their friendship and the feeling that everything could be resolved in the world if there were more films like this.

To actually rate this movie on any kind of grade is wrong as it exists of level all of its own",9
"Freeman's performance was excellent. The scene near the end with the parole board was priceless albeit a bit contrived. The predictable ending would have been more convincing had it been filmed in a less-remote location. Chances of Freeman's character finding that particular scene at that particular time was just not convincing. Nonetheless, too nice a film not to see again and again.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that slid through the Theatres without drawing much deserved attention. It made no real impact at the academy award either. So why is this movie currently holding the second spot at the imdb top 250, only beaten by the untouchable ""Il Padrino""? First of all, I believe the movie is spot on when it comes to the description of human endurance, persistence, and adaptation. The development of the characters also indicates that imprisonment and freedom can't always be divided by walls alone. Sometimes the highest walls and the worst conditions aren't enough to stop the human spirit, other times the absence of boundaries and even the prospect of something better, can break you down if you lack some of your primal needs. This is where I believe the greatness of this movie really shows. It perfectly pinpoints the vast scope of the human mind, and how we react both similar and differently to challenges in life, and the movie does so in a simple, straightforward way! As ""Red"" says upon the climax of this marvellous movie: ""Every man has his breaking point""",10
"There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again. I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement.",9
"There are a few mistakes in this movie, but nothing real significant. The dialogue, and Morgan Freeman's monologue were perfect; went perfectly with the flow of the movie. This movie has the best finale of any movie that I've ever seen.",10
"This film is about one thing and one thing only: HOPE. Hope will get you through anything!

Oh, and if you haven't already done so, don't bother reading the Stephen King novella from which this film is based. It foreshadows the ending a little too much and takes away that anxiety you get as you near the end of the film.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is, without peer, the best movie of all time. Although it may have a somewhat limited plot ( then again which film doesn't?) it makes this up with the sequences of bizarre twists and turns.

Andy Dufrene claims he was wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. The prison he is sent to is brutal - a hypocritical church-going warden who murders inmates for his own gain - and sodomy is prevalent. Andy's character is determined to survive through all of his hardships.

The rest of the characters are so complex that to describe them would merely dampen everyone elses opinion on the film. I know it was nominated for some Academy Awards, and didn't win any, but it deserved more than Titanic!

It is didactic and its main theme is hope. In fact the last few lines of the film always bring tears to my eyes - ""I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my mind. I hope."" These words, uttered by Morgan Freemon are truely inspirational words.

My opinion is watch this movie as often as possible, and learn from it.

The Shawshank Redemption - the best movie ever!!",10
"I was lucky enough to have seen this movie in a theatre. I consider myself lucky because not only did I not want to go that night, from what I've read, very few people were able to catch this great film in its true form. I'll never forget the moment the movie ended. I was stunned. My friends and I did not move and spoke scarcily on the drive home. The Shawshank Redemption is a rare type of movie, one that not only contains all the elements of a great film, but makes you feel happy to be alive when its over. If you haven't already, please see this movie. And if you have, please watch it again. I know I will! A much deserved #1 with IMdB users!",7
This Movie Really from true story?? this is old movie but so nice. im so glad with the producer of this movie :D,10
"To say that The Shawshank Redemption is an exquisite piece of film-work doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how this film can and will affect those that choose to view it. Yes, some points are brought violently to the surface, yet throughout Shawshank, there is a subtlety to the relationships between all of the characters, not just the lead roles. I have read a copy of the original screenplay, and although many ""adjustments"" were made by Frank Darabont, I honestly believe that absolutely nothing could be added or even taken away to improve this work in any way. And as strange as it may seem to my friends who ask, yes, being a woman, The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite film of all time. And yes, ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things...""",10
The best movie I saw until 2018.I think the likelihood of making a movie like this is very small.,7
"I've recently been going through my vast collection of videos, replaying my favorites in an effort to determine which is best.

Without question, ""Shawshank Redemption"" towers above all the others, even ""The Godfather,"" which slightly outranks it in the IMDb list of 250 best movies.

I have also taken the trouble of looking up most of the reviews of the movie, and I remain puzzled at the criticism that even such respected critics as Roger Ebert gave the movie. The most prevalent criticism is that the movie is too long. I don't agree. ""Shawshank"" is perfectly paced. Another criticism, that the story-line is predictable, is absurd. What makes ""Shawshank"" stand out from all other movies is that nothing that happens in it has ever happened in a movie before. It is sui generis, in a class by itself. If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean. If you haven't seen it, drop everything else and get ahold of it.",10
"I remember when this movie came out. It seemed like a ridiculous title, and I was more into Forrest Gump then spending any hard earned money on this movie. At the local multiplex, my date coerced me into going anyway, and it was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life. It's like the first time you saw The Godfather, or Star Wars. It has gradually become my all time favorite, and for two main reasons: One: to the new viewer, it may appear a rough prison movie, but what lies ahead is the enchanting tale of hope, and the enduring bond of true friendship, themes that do not appear in too many modern films. The second reason is that after multiple viewings, i have yet to tire of it. It grips me each time. Perhaps it is the subtle introduction, or the mesmerizing ending. This is the only movie I would ever dream of giving a perfect score...............",8
"I Saw this movie just today, on a small television in a High school class room. I saw it in three rows, which was actually extremely annoying while I had to wait till the next day to see what happens. I have never seen those pupils so quiet, IT REALLY IS AN AMAZING FILM - GREAT acting, great scenic play and directing in one of the best films in my memory. If you haven't seen it / go see it",10
"In my personal view, any person in the world who understands English, would never say some thing wrong about this movie. If some does understands English and still says something wrong about this movie, it means he has not seen the movie. If some one understands English and has seen this movie as well, and still he says something bad about this movie, it means he has a really bad taste regarding movies or he does not know what a movie is. (According to me, these kind of people should be hanged to death) This movie has changed the life of thousands of people around the world. I don't think that any one having a little bit of intellectual level would dislike this movie.",9
"In my unpretentious opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie have ever made. Tim Robbins is great in that. It's a movie where you can find friendship, hope, unfair situations and reward. It's a tense movie, where you are together the players, with their feelings and emotions.

I really suggest you to watch it. You will not get disappointed.",10
"I went to this movie on spec when it first came out. Little was I to know that it was to become my favorite movie of all time. From the very beginning shot of the prison, to the last shot of the beach in Mexico, the movie had me in every emotion possible. Fear, joy, laughter, sadness, despair and hope. The acting was great, Freeman was robbed for not getting a deserved Oscar for this movie. It is one of those rare movies which you can sit down to over and over again.",10
"Shawshank Redemption would be on any's top ten films of 90s. Very emotionally powerful and inspiring, the movie was on par with the much hyped movie Forrest Gump if not better. It was a prison tale that should be lots of despair, misery and violence yet Shawshank manage to portray the sad as well as hope and salavation of the mind in human beings. Andy(Tim Robbins) as a man who was wrongly convicted of life imprisonment and refusal to give up and despair and efforts to find any means to escape was amazing. His final escape act was a lesson for me in perseverance. A def must watch! The novel by Stephan King which Shawshank is based on gave a little more thoughts into the main characters'mind and you must read the short story if you like the movie.",9
"Sometimes (or, maybe, most times) fear of something that can become real is the greatest fear of all. Fans of Stephen King horror books and films might not agree, but I think that this might be the best filming of a Stephen King book ever. HORROR VACUI, the fear of the void, the fear of the unknown, is the breakpoint from which everybody goes either up or down.

This whole movie is about the real meaning of freedom, what it is and what it means to us. Those who have already seen it a couple of times know that each watching reveals another story beneath a story, and that in the end you end up asking yourself if it was not the best lecture on the thinness of the line between good and bad that you would ever have.

Not for a single moment your attention falters from what happens on the big screen. Superbly directed and superbly cast, this movie might as well be compared to a superbly orchestrated and performed symphony.

A must for everyone out for a good feature!",10
"I am not a writer, consequently any review I might make will not capture the essence of what I wanted to articulate. Therefore instead of a review, I'll give a statement regarding this film: This is one of the few times where a film's success, it's overall feeling and merits, surpasses that of the book (or in this case story), and in stating this, there should be no diminution to what Stephen King wrote.

In regards to books being made into films, I feel that each version (film and story) itself enhances the other, and each should not be compared or critiqued for what is lacking, or plentiful. Instead, they should each be looked upon as a separate entity, with each 'form' evoking our emotions in their own unique and separate way!

In order to make these statements, I have to say that I have read the Stephen King short story (or novella), ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"". I have also listened to the audio-book, and all three inspire, give hope and yes even define the word 'Redemption', in their own unique ways.

One might not be able to fairly compare an apple's flavour, to that of an orange, but you certainly can compare a Granny Smith to a Red Delicious. They are both apples at the core, it's the texture, pulp and flavour that make it different. That core could be a story, and each medium (written, visual, audio etc) provides a similar, yet unique flavour to be savored!",10
"OK. This is definitely my favorite movie of all time. The acting by all actors is superb, especially the roles of Dufresne and Red, played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I have been a fan of the story by Stephen King ever since I read it in high school. When I heard that Frank Darabont, who also directed a short King film (The Woman in the Room) in 1983, would be writing the screenplay and directing I was ecstatic. This film could not have been adapted better by Kubrick or King himself. Can't wait for The Green Mile, Frank.",10
"I've seen some good movies in my time (The Godfather part1 + 2 come to mind), but, I can honestly say that none have moved me like this. I love the sence of hope that it gives anyone, and the fact that despite everything else, Andy Dufrense, still has hope. ""Get Busy livin' or get busy dyin'!"" A friend of mine recomended it to me, as the greatest movie he's ever seen. I have to agree.

>I just loved it, and with Hollywood would try harder at making good movies as opposed to trashy, shallow, movies that are aimed at the lowest common denominator.

Rating out-of-10? Guess!",10
"This is my favorite movie of all time. It is about one man's struggle of trying to cope with his life in prison sentence for a crime he didnt commit. This movie make prisoners look like true human beings, not just savages. You really learn about each of the characters. Morgan Freeman gives a great role as Red, who stands by Andy in every instance.",1
"I really don't like Stephen King very much, but every once in a while he really surprises me (Stand By Me and Shawshank Redemption). I also am not a very big fan of prison movies either, but this definitely is the exception. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both outstanding in this film. Their characters are completely convincing. This is the best film of the 1990's in my opinion, and my favorite of all time.",10
"This is a rare movie that deserves a 10 - My reasoning; that I would not change one single, solitary thing about it, period.

This is arguably my favorite movie of all time. It fails to become boring despite repeated viewings.",6
This movie is terrible the worst I've ever watched bruh not worth a penny!,9
"my comments of this film will be brief. it is a quite simply a rewarding film in which the acting is very moving and the actual storyline is superb iwas engrossed in the film from start to finish. it was a drama of what life can throw back at you in the extreme.not been a writing man i will close with the words i think describe this truly great film. moving,thought provoking,and one of the best films of its kind.",9
"This movie is a work of art , it is a movie that makes you think about how great it is to be alive and free , and how other peoples may have a struggle each day to stay alive and free , in the mind of themselves ,for a start .",9
"Anyone out there who takes the Academy Awards seriously is out of touch to say the least. If there has ever been a film made that was actually deserving of sweeping the Oscars it's ""Shawshank"". Not only should it have won the 7 Oscars it was up for, but several others it did not even get nominations for.

Terence Marsh deserved another Oscar for his set design (yes, that was a set) of the amazing prison. James Whitmore gave a performance as great as any supporting actor that year. How Tim Robbins did not join Morgan Freeman in the Best Actor category (take your pick who to give the Oscar to) is beyond me. And the saddest thing, next to the film not winning Best Picture, is that Frank Darabont did not take home the Best Director Oscar that was so rightfully his.

The Academy will continue handing out its Oscars for ""The Best Picture of the Year"" to movies like Titanic, The English Patient, and Forrest Gump. I guess The Shawshank Redemption will have to settle for ""The Greatest Movie Ever Made"".",7
"It's easy to see why the film has received such a high rating; it's breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Mostly the plot, acting, and premise; but this film is most notable for how it leaves you feeling after watching it. When you watch a film, you may not remember it for days, but this film has a way of staying with you.

It's the ultimate tale of friendship, hope and perseverance in the face of hardship.

It's not my favourite, but I can see why so many people regard it as one of the greatest films of all time. I urge you to watch it again if you haven't or haven't done so in a while. 10/10.",8
"If an alien who knows nothing about the Academy Awards were to suddenly land on earth and then introduced to the Academy Awards and asked to watch the nominated movies for 1995 and then shown the results, she would have absolutely no respect for the Academy Awards. Shawshank Redemption is pure genius at every level: acting, script, cinematography, character development, and on and on and on. Movies don't get much better than this!

The moral of the story is that there are great movies and performances out there that have not been properly recognized by the Academy, so make sure an award is not the only criterion you use when searching for a truly great film.",10
"This movie was deeply moving. I have seen it about six times so far and cried the first four times I saw it. As a person who has at times felt as if I was sentenced to ""the hole"", I could relate to Andy and to Red. Perhaps that is one reason the movie has touched so many people.

The message and heart in this film is profound. When Red said, ""I hope....."" at the end of the movie, I was hoping too.",9
"After I saw Darabont's ""Green Mile"" I heard that he had another movie, and I had to see it. I taped Shawshank on TV and watched it, not expecting a lot. Well, it wasn't as good as ""Green Mile,"" but it was pretty darned close, and it was quite similar in terms of themes and character types. I thought the warden was terrific. I was so engrossed in the movie, I wanted to strangle the man myself. Although many say the movie was predictable, I was quite surprised by the ending. As in the case of the ""Green Mile,"" the awards Shawshank richly deserved were passed on to other, not so good, films. The only downside was the portrayal of the characters. The movie basically said that criminals are good guys, and the prison guards are villains. Isn't it the other way around?

I give Shawshank a 9/10",10
"This is the greatest film ever made.

The story of Andy Dufersne, the man who have never lost his hope, who have always believed, that one day justice would have come to being, that one day he would have forgotten with the help of Pacific Ocean and his best friend Red Redding.

I have seen it maybe for twenty times and it is even better and better. I would like to recommend it especially to people who think, that their situation can´t be worst and who think, that their problems can´t be solved. To be honest, I have hoped for the whole life that one they I will see film as The Shawshank Redenption is.

Frank Darabont is a magician, because this kind of debut you can´t see every day. If he will stay on this level of creating we will only stare with open mouth on his other films.

Now I have great expectations about The Green Mile.",10
"Hey, I have to say that this movie is one of my favorites. It is up on my top 10. Anyway, this movie is amazing. The story, the acting, and anything else you can think of make this movie a classic. Morgan Freeman (plays the character red) did an excellent job on his role. I think he was totally robbed when he didn't get the Oscar for best supporting actor. To get back on the movie, if you looking for a good one to watch, you have to see this. The movie is wonderfully played. Also hats off to the great job Tim Robbins did playing his main character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this one, your missing out!!",10
"It was really very easy to like this film - in fact, it was impossible for me NOT to like it. Maybe the key is the phenomenon that is called ""lagom"" in Sweden. That word doesn't exist in any other language, but it means something like ""just right"". Not too much, not to little.

I felt very comfortable after watching this film. It didn't change my life, didn't start a revolution - it was just a very good film!

Actually, the end was a bit unexpected. It gave the film a romantic touch that otherwise wouldn't have been there. The only bad thing is that I found details in the story too improbable, and that was a disturbing moment in that type of film. It wouldn't have mattered in an action-filled story, but now it made me irritated, because it stole attention from the story!! Anyway that detail doesn't stop me from really recommending this film - its simply ""just right""!",10
"This is the best movie of all time!!! It has all you need and more. Amazing performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. This movie is a CLASSIC and will stand the test of time. The story has everything but it clearly presents the true ideas of friendship and relationships between people, especially under the worst situations. Anyone who hasnt seen this movie- DONT WALK_ RUN- to see it! It will stick with you forever",10
"this movie is one of only 3 that I have on dvd right now, and I am so glad that I own it. anyone who is a movie fan of any kind should see this. this is an amazing movie shows what someone can do when they hope. andy duphresne was a character who had hope and kept it alive for 20 years even though he was in prison for life with a crime he didn't commit. every aspect of this movie: the camera work, the acting, the dialogue, and the story work together in a perfect blend of drama. the best part was when red came in for his 3rd parole hearing. his first 2 times, he had just told them what he thought they wanted to hear. ""yes, I believe that i'm entirely cured. i believe that i am no longer a danger to society."" he was rejected those 2 times. but the third he was honest, and the outcome was far different. A nearly perfect movie.",10
"I love just drifting through the IMDb just to read others opinions on certain movies, and having checked out the comments on Shawshank Redemption, I'm amazed that some of the latest reviews are from people who have who have only just watched it in the last few weeks. I'm even more pleased that they acknowledge it as one of the best films made, and that it lived up to the hype that has passed via word of mouth. It is a criminal offence that it did not win a single Oscar but at least it not one of those films that will be classed as an undiscovered gem. Career best performances are brought out of all members of the cast: Clancy Brown, Bill Gunton and Bill Sadler will surely never hit those heights again. It may not have been a box office hit but all associated with the movie should feel proud. The cliche is true of The Shawshank Redemption: they don't make them like that any more. Spread the word!",10
"Please Ignore This Review. Sorry To Waste Your Time Everyone. This is a test. I need 10 lines of text so I am going to write as much as I can. I feel like I am writing a school paper, as this is how I always waste space. But hey, as long as it's 10 lines, right? So since I'm here and if you're still reading, let me tell you about my day. I went to work today and earned some extra cash. Who doesn't love extra cash? I mean, come on! This is America, people! If you don't love extra cash, then you're not American! Anyways, I went to work today and then after that I went home and checked some stuff off of my checklist, after which I am writing this review. I never did tell you why I needed ti write this review, did I? I probably should, as not to completely waste your time (although I've wasted it a lot already). I am writing this review because IMDb wants me to do a checklist of things to ""Complete My Account"". It's really stupid if you ask me, but I've now written more that 10 lines of text so I will bid you farewell :)",8
No other movie like it! The greatest tragedy about this movie is that it never won an oscar! Out of 7 nominations it did'nt even pick up one. I ask what is wrong with these people?? It is very rare that a movie such as Shawshank comes along and has such an influence on the lives of many who have watched it. It touches the heart and is an inspiration for us all. What makes it such a masterpiece is its unpredictability right till the very end. In my opinion this movie should be re-released and nominated again for an Oscar.,7
"Only those who have been in prison can appreciate best the dreams and hopes that keep folks in there going. Most are merely pipe dreams - never to be realised. I think this flick hits the nail on the head, pardon the cliché. 10 outta 10!",10
"If you haven't seen the Shawshank Redemption by now, it's likely that you live in a cave and haven't been in touch with society for the last five years. This is one of the best films ever made because it captivates your attention from start to finish. I can throw it in the VCR and it doesn't matter what scene may be playing, I'm instantly engaged. A strong story, solid acting and some glorious cinematography create a film that I cannot go more than a month without watching it. I will likely wear the tape that the film is captured on out and I will be forced to replace that tape and I can honestly say I won't mind having to do so.",10
It was okay I mean like yh it is what it is I guess,10
"It's rare to find a modern movie of this caliber. 'Shawshank' is not cheapened with some feel-good Hollywood romance, heroic fight scenes, or a fast paced, edge-of-your-seat escape plan. In place of this ever-present drivel, this movie excites the heart and warms the soul through the excellent performances, exquisite story-line, and unforgettable quotes. Andy demonstrates a heroic spirit and an indomitable will to touch the lives of those around him.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption, is and always will be one of the greatest films ever. Tim Robbins portrail of Andy is enough to melt the coldest heart. The secound i saw this on DVD i just had to buy it. I give this film a rating of infinity out of 10 as it deserves it.",10
"Recently, the quality of movies seems to have gone down. There are too many action flicks and cheap comedies and not enough really good movies. There are very few that have been made recently that are moving and contain powerful messages. The Shawshank redemption is one. I can honestly say that I look at many aspects of life differently because of this movie. And yet it saddens me that so many people that I know have never even seen it. I have always thought of it as under-appreciated. It was because of seeing this movie ranked 3rd on the top 250 that I became a member of this site. It stands out as one of the best movies ever made.",9
"I've seen this movie about 7 times now and every time i still get the shivers that i had the first time watching it.This movie is absolute my nr.1 movie by far and is not just a film but also leaves a vision on life and to appreciate a good friendship in the deepest meaning. The quotes given in the film are typical and makes you think of how you should live your life. It made me think about stuff.the movie touched me in such a way that i thought of certain attributes in life suddenly more beautiful.If i ever need to be reminded or have a wake up call, i play the shawshank redemption. I was later on surprised that it was written by Stephen King, a guy that is most known for his work on thrillers/horrors.",10
"I love this movie, best movie ever made. I garuntee that if you see this movie for the fist time, it will be in your top ten after you finish watching it. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both diserved the best male oscar award for this picture.",10
"I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption back in '94 and thinking how absolutely out of the ordinary it was for a Hollywood picture. No soft soap ending, no moral message and no ""Whey-hey isn't America great"" that you usually get from Hollywood pics. The fact its a Steven King is remarkable to, out of his usual style, I think. It's photographed beautifully and makes no bones about the harsh reality of prison. I don't really know much about Frank Dufont but I would really like to see his other pictures based on the strength of this one.",9
I have many films that I regard as my personal favourites and it is difficult to put these in any order. However the number one in my list is easy - The Shawshank Redemption. This film has addictive qualities - if this film is on a screen you have to watch it no matter how often you've seen it. I think I'll go and watch it again now!,10
"This and Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" rank side by side at the summit of my all-time favorites list (and no, I am not a Morgan Freeman freak).

This is the kind of movie that starts out solid and keeps driving at you...solid. It does not make any insultingly wrongful turns in logic nor does it infringe on your conception of what is believable and what is excruciatingly unbelievable.

This is a no-frills story of a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering his wife. The film's glorious irony, that his 19-years-long jail sentence is the best thing to happen to him in his life, slowly manifests itself.",1
well...what can i say about that movie...it's just a dramatic galore..it takes you in a side..and then pull you the hell from the other side..i think morgan freeman was great...i liked him much here:))) also the music was great..it is really a 10/10 movie..,10
"I must say this is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen - and without a doubt one of the best. Although it doesn't resemble the usual Stephen King writings, it helps to show his diverse talent as a writer.",8
"You've heard the rule, the book is always better than the movie. Here is the only exception I have found. This movie is better than the book. A great book - Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King. The movie is even better. It could well have been named, the Shawshank Exception.",10
"This is what it's all about! The creation of a movie that will move us all. A great story, great actors, great filming, but most of all:

A superb plot. Absolutly superb.",10
"This movie has to be the most electrifing movies of all time. This short story (originally written by Stephen King) gives a heart pounding reality of an innocent banker who uses hope, courage, and brains to OUTsmart the pison walls of Shawshank. Morgan Freeman plays an exceptional character (Red) who claims that being ""institutionalized"" can keep a man from being truly free. This movie displays one of the best one-liners I have ever heard and the best ending life has to offer-(if you listen close to what Red has to say he fore shadows Andy's greatest stunt.) I enjoyed SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and I enjoy IMDB, they display all the memorable quotes that I enjoyed and I gave this movie a Rating of 10!!",10
"How can anybody dislike this film. It's definitely the best drama film I've ever seen. If you haven't already seen this film, don't rent it, BUY IT!!!!!. I don't know of anybody who dislikes this film. Its very similar to the 'The Green Mile' but only better, I do like the Green Mile though but this is far better. This film should be number 1 instead of the 'The Godfather'.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption was in the better sense of the word perfect. It reflected on the true life in the solitary confinement of prison. This movie was so powerful that it changed my direction of life. I went from wanting to be a fireman to a movie director and now I am living my dream because of this amazing film. Frank Darabont and Stephen King worked at their best to write this amazing story, added with the amazing acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this is a must see for any movie fanatic. I give this movie a perfect score!",8
"As i'm keen on prison based movies, i thought i'd check the film out. After seeing it about 20 times, i have come to the conclusion that this is my favorite film...ever!

As you see the film more and more times, you notice things you didn't before, ie: clues to the ending are given (Red saying Andy's dreams were ""s****y pipe dreams"", the way in which Andy escapes).

I did an essay for Media Studies, and I had to watch the film in great detail, and that made me like the film even more because you get to understand the characters more and understand their actions and reasonings.

If you haven't seen the fillm then I strongly suggest you watch it because it's GREAT!

p.s read the 'goofs' on this film because they're really interesting!!",10
"Words are far too poor to embrace the magic of this film. This movie along with the brilliance of Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and the plot twists and spirit created by the master Stephen King is a masterpiece. I have never felt such a mixture of emotions from one film. And this film certainly delivers the kind of electricity that touches one's soul.",10
This movie is the greatest piece of work ever put on video cassette. If you haven't seen it get to the nearest video store and rent it. It can change the way you feel about life totally with just a few quotes and actions by the characters inside Shawshank Prison. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on a great show and make this movie the best movie I've ever seen.,10
"This has got to be the best film that I have ever seen. It is Funny, Emotional and thoroughly enjoyable...It makes you search for a better side of yourself. And it just makes you feel good about yourself. And realise that ""Hope, Will set you Free"".",10
"Friendship. In a word, this movie is all about friendship. Great casting makes the characters believable. Extraordinary acting makes them come to life. The bond developed between Andy (Tim Robbins) & Red (Morgan Freeman) is so real that you feel it. If you're not a sensitive male going in, you will be one coming out. Go BUY this movie. It'll make you laugh, cry, and -- most of all -- hope. The supporting cast is almost as good as Andy & Red. The warden is diabolically evil. And his #1 minion (Clancy Brown) turns in a first-rate performance. Much attention was paid to the sets. Not much left to say except . . . what a movie!!! There is no comparable film work out there. I ""hope"" someday there will be. 'Til then, The Shawshank Redemption is the best-in-show.",10
"I think the more time passed the better the film is cherished. A complete masterpiece of a dark steorotipycal genre that transform the film over the years.

Morgan Freeman forever will be remembered as the greatstest taleman of Shashank and his carrer took over from that point",10
"The Shawshank redemption is simply excellent! a story that goes right to your heart and goes really deep in to the soul, and it shows us that hope does matter, without hope, we have nothing to go for.

Wonderful acting by the modern legend Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins the story is brilliantly told, and the movies should be one second shorter and not one second longer, Stephen King and Frank Darabont really knows what to do to keep the story fresh all the way!

you should definitly get this movie!!",8
"Superb acting and dialogue paint this moving tale of hope and friendship. With beautiful cinematography, complex characters, and witty yet poetic dialogue, the Shawshank Redemption is movie art at its finest. I find myself so enraptured by it, that I am unable to leave until the movie is complete... and I've seen it about 100 times. This is not a movie to watch while doing something else.",10
"This is one of the best movie I have ever seen. I usually do not have patience to watch a movie in one sitting. But for this one, it kept me interested and I watched it without missing a single dialogue. Morgan Freeman narration is one of the best part of this movie.",10
"This movie is so far the best American film I have ever seen. I am surprised it didn't receive the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director. The story is touching and the actors delivered excellent performance. It captured the subtle human emotions one expressed when he faced a sudden traumatic misfortune in life and demonstrated how he kept hope and faith when he spent years of difficult life in prison. It also has a good portrait of true friendship between the two main characters in the movie (Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman). I am sure I will own a DVD for this film and will watch it again and again over the years as every time I watched it, it reminded me of the courage, hope and faith one should have when faced with obstacles in life. I can't say enough good thing about this film. If you haven't watched it yet, I highly highly recommend it and you won't be disappointed.",10
"This movie (Shawshank Redemption) is a pathetic ripe off of escape from Alcatraz and some other fine movies. kign even says he based the book on movies he saw growing up. if you plagiarise more then one source its still plagiarism. I thought the movie was decent until I saw Eastwoods movie, then I new itwas pure junk.

steals the characters - steals even the pet animal - steals his job in the jail - steals the method of escape


Shawshank Redemption steals everything but replaces Clint Eastwoods acting with amateurs. how Stephen King didn't get lambasted for plagiarism is beyond me. This must be something he only edited for his sack. I am sure most of the filming adding in these details and it doesn't even follow the book.

I do not see how such a blatant ripe off is considered to be the best movie of all time by IMDb. It really takes away all of your credibility.

Both movies using a poster to cover a hole in the wall. There are just far too many similarities between the two movies for this to be accepted. If this was a university paper I would expect an expulsion.

I guess they figure they can change the old mans pet from a bird to a rat and everything is OK. because that clearly changes the entire story.

Lastly no one in the movie was redeemed.",10
The movie is very interesting and you can watch it more than one time the story in this movie is very interesting cool too watch,9

"The films is good I actually watched it multiple times as recommended by the reviews here. I just wanted to say, watch another film! Sure, The Shawshank Redemption is a great film but there are other great (possibly better) films, come on, be a bit more adventurous! I'll recommend you a title right now; The Cat in the Hat (2003)",10
"The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont, is a timeless masterpiece that explores the themes of hope, friendship, and redemption. The film, based on the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King, tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is falsely convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover and sent to Shawshank prison.

The film's plot is well-crafted, and it skillfully balances moments of tension and despair with moments of hope and joy. The film's characters are well-developed, and their relationships are deep and nuanced. The chemistry between the two main leads, Andy and Red (Morgan Freeman), is particularly strong, and their friendship forms the heart of the movie.

The performances in The Shawshank Redemption are superb. Tim Robbins delivers a subtle and nuanced portrayal of Andy, while Morgan Freeman shines as the wise and world-weary Red. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Bob Gunton as the cruel and corrupt warden and William Sadler as the tragic figure of Heywood.

The film's cinematography is striking, with its use of shadows, low angles, and close-ups creating a sense of intimacy and claustrophobia that perfectly captures the atmosphere of the prison. The film's score, composed by Thomas Newman, is also outstanding, and it perfectly complements the film's themes and moods.

The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant and emotionally resonant film that has stood the test of time. It is a testament to the power of hope and friendship, and it is a reminder that even in the darkest of places, there is always a glimmer of light. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates great cinema.",10
I dont't have any words best !!!! this movie inspired me and asked me at the same time recomande,9
"Simply awesone, it goes much beyond the Stephen King's short story.",9
"Shawshank is a story about a man who is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. He finds himself in the pits of hell or what is commonly known as Shawshank Prison. There he learns about the power of truth and friendship as he changes the hearts of those he knows and lives with. This story is not about the problems of our justice or prison systems and the horrors that prisoners face, not only from their fellow inmates but also from those there to ""manage"" them; rather this story relays the close bond that people form in tough situations and how our will to survive is not just about whether or not we live but how we live. To quote William Wallace from Braveheart, ""every man dies not every man lives."" This is the story about choosing to live and live with dignity and friendship in the face of all hardships. Highly Recommended",9
"No wonder it is the best movie, it is awesome. but i see better movies that they are pure 10 out of 10 so i give this 9.5, since there is no 0.00 so i give it 9",9
This is a movie where you can't point out a single flaw or mistake in it and that is rare and the only reason I gave it 6/10. Not having any flaws or mistakes or simply just not enough for it to have a higher rating. There is nothing really to interpret in the movie and everything is pretty much laid out for you. It is a classic and you can always watch it without feeling bored throughout the movie but if you are looking for a movie with a deeper meaning this is not it.,10
This is the Best Movie Ever in the World and I Watch this Movie in three times.I Recommend Every One to Watch this Movie,9

"Injustice, betrayal, friendship, hope, love, brotherhood, loyalty, revenge, justice, this movie has it all 10/10",10
"The most overrated movie of the century. Shawshank is the perfect example of a film that can fool you into thinking it's great. It's mawkish, fantastical, sappy and manipulative. It's merely good and it's laughably that people actually place it next to masterpieces such as Rashomon, Citizen Kane, Notorious, Apocalypse Now, 2001 and Raging Bull",10
Cool i really love this genre of movies because i'm a really huge fan of this director,9
"How can I explain this movie in one simple review! It's impossible...

Best movie i've ever seen. Movie had good plot and it was entertaining.,10
Fantasticmovie!!! this movie with act by morgan freeman is great and cool...,4
"I had been meaning to watch this movie for a long time, but I got the chance only yesterday, when I watched it on HBO. I can only say that for eight years I had missed a chance to witness a brilliant work. Tim Robbins is really good, so is Morgan Freeman. But the movie is not about any central character. The movie as a whole is devastatingly perfect. I saw Forrest Gump and thought it was awesome, deserving of the Oscar. But eight years since, I have to change my mind...",10
"One of the best movie I have ever seen.

Such a nice movie. Quite interesting storyline and nice actors.,10
I can't get enough of this movie it is really good to watch,10
So bored couldn't be asked to watch the rest of the movie and I was only 2 mins in.,10
Perfect film peoduction in its era everything is perfect,1
Such a great story line one of my most loved movies to watch on a Saturday night with family and friends would recommend to anyone that loves the thrill you get from movies,10
I saw the move 2 times and every time experience it again .. Great move great acting and directing .,9
"Really appereciat to all crfue member, who is working in this movie. tnks for making this",10
This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!,10
"The most over rated film of all time, riddled with plot holes and plagued with sloppy scripting. Not terrible, but not worth watching unless you have a morbid curiosity to see what the fuss is all about and certainly not worth a second viewing.",9
"It is one of the most fantastic films I have ever seen. Thanks to a colleague of my company, she introduced it to me. Actually, I have noticed the film for a long time in video&audio shops in my city. But maybe the cover and the translation of the movie's name are not attractive, it didn't catch my attention. I saw it in a cold winter afternoon. And when the film ended, I thanked GOD for taking me such a good film to me. Tim Robbins and Freeman, from then on, became my most favorite actors. The end of the film is make me moved. It may the best end for the audience and Andy and Red. Somewhere you have no memory, in paradise maybe. I wish I could take time there someday.",10
"Sure one of the best movie ever made, very intense.

For me 8 stars out of 10, not more.",9
"Im gonna sound like everybody else when I say this, but the movie is great from beginning to end. I never even planned to watch this movie it just came on while I was watching tv one night. The movie is a classic and if you have not watched it yet please do!",10
"The review says it all, timeless. Smart educational film. From the beginning to the end. Tim Robbins at first, you assume he is either a wrong person but when you gradually continue watching the film. His characters rub into you, converting him to be a good character. The story-line was terrific for sure one of my favourite movies of all time. The incredible story-line, highly recommend to watch it if you have not seen this before.",9
"There is no movie that I love more than The Shawshank Redemption. I have seen the movie at least 10 times, and it never ceases to amaze me how well it is performed. The plot line is one of the best that I have seen in a long time, and Tim Robbins plays his character as if he were living in that life. The most amazing thing happened after I watched this movie: I started to regard everyone with the same ""look inside of me instead of at me"" view, and have lately even started to think ""innocent until PROVEN guilty"" and not ""he looks guilty so he must be."" If you have not seen this movie, you are missing out on an extremely well written and performed piece of art. I highly reccomend it. In fact, I urge anyone who has not seen it to rent it tonight.",10
"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King,",10
It sems nice movie.....................................................,9
I dont think it good as name..........................,10
A classic piece of unforgettable film making. and a great movie to watch. I would recommend it to everyone. without spoilers and watch yourself feeling happy,10
"This movie got it all, comedy, drama etc. It also based on a true story that makes the movie even better. It's a incredible story about this young man and his journey trough life and the obstacles he need to overtake are not easy.",10
I HATE THIS MOVIE WASTED SO MUCH TIME WATCHING IT WHEN COULD BE WATCHING MEMEUMOUS FACE REVEAL,10
"It started the ""prison escape genre"" with a number of movies referencing scenes from this. A true masterpiece.",10
"This is definitely the best film I have ever seen, Tim Robbins Plays the Best Role Of His Career Portraying A Convicted Murderer In Shawshank Prison, The relationship with him and ""Red"" grows through the movie, there are many ups and downs through his prison life and he comes through most of them, Tommy gives him hope of finally being free but the idea is foiled after not long. Then a perfect ending follows. Quotes Such as ""Get Busy Livin', Or get Busy Dyin'"" and ""Hope Is A Good Thing, Maybe The Best Of Things, And No Good Thing Ever Dies"" more memorable from this movie

truly amazing film I would recommend it to anyone, of you haven't seen this you must watch it before you die!!!",10
tim robbins and morgan freeman are great in the film it movies you in every way the movie is based on 20 years of these men lives and goes up and down the whole way and made very realistic and people can relate to it you cant not like this master peace it's the best movie ive seen in a while .,10
"Best film which i seen all time. Many films about of action, good.",10
"The most exciting movie I've ever seen and it has an impact on my life attitude. Even if your dearest love betrayed you, even if you are in a prison and in fact you are innocent, you have to keep faith. Work, work everyday and never lose your hope. The god will be with you.",8
"Opening is just a gateway to this world. Ewerything inside is plausible. The ""main man"" is just like Tom Hanks, still just his own. ""Green mile""...different attitude here, but same berries are being picked. Friendship and brotherhood are apreciated high! Watch and see, u won't be miss lead or disappointed!",9
"This is an amazing movie that i have wached ever. You will watch this one over and over again. It felt to me as a prisoner whom has no sin. Actually, being justice, always most hardest thing in the world. This movie is unforgettable.",10
"I can't to show my Great grandchildren this movie

...............",10
I've recently watched this movie and i found this movie the best one so far,10
"Muazzam, çok hos bir film bunu deneme için yaziyorum cokta takilmayin",10
"This movie has awesome dialogues. After ""End Game"", the only movie whose dialogues I liked is ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Though many will find this movie a bit boring as it neither has any comedy scenes nor great suspense.",10
"This sen does it to my very bad lags not to keep the birds off the cage. It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith.",10
The beautiful feeling that accompanied me watching this great masterpiece cannot be ignored,10
"The Best in the History, the genius performances, the greatness of the story and the beautiful simple end that make you adore the movie and forget the suffering that the characters face, everything is extraordinary",10
"T is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.",8
Loved it. It had a great plot. Love the frllowoewsjip,10
I wached the film 4 times and i loved the film every once,10
"What a movie! can't describe with word, a Movie i watched more than 10times!",10
"I think irregardless of whether or not you've gone through the judicial system in some formality, every American can very much appreciate this culture rich, drama of pure Spielberg genius!

Just because I saw it when I was 10, I wouldn't suggest letting your kid see it lol!",10
"If I watch a film and I am unable to look away for one second, to me that means the film is simply brilliant. I could not turn away from the screen when i was watching The Shawshank Redemption and it is a film that you must see. It contains a powerful message and is a very strong film. From start to finish you get right into it and is a tear jerking film in some aspect. The acting is great and Morgan Freeman is as perfect as ever. The reason why I love this film is because the message is powerful and teaches you something important which not many films do. The plot is that a man is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank Prison. His dream is then to break out and along the way encounters some heartbreaking moments but fails to fall and continues to fight on.",10
"This movie is the absolute pinnacle of human creativity and intelligence. One of, if not the best movies I have ever seen in my entire lifetime and that we will ever see in human history. The movie touches upon all parts of life from respect, accountability, intelligence, decency, friendship and much more. The movie tells us so much about us as humans and how even at the lowest moments in our lives, one can and must redeem themselves. The bond between Andy, Red, and the viewer is absolutely unbreakable and I shed tears even time I watch the movie. As I have said before, The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest movie of all time.",9
Definitely one of the best movies I've seen. Great acting and a great story and I always love coming back to this movie. It certainly deserves it's rating here!,10
It's the best!!! it's the first!!! and ... it deserves this...!!!,10
"Perfect movie, perfect cast, perfect score. one of my favorite movies to have come from the mind of a human.",6
"Life, Death, Friendship, Brotherhood, Love, Extortion, Justice .. I don't know what to say, this movie was a Masterpiece! No words needed to describe the greatness of the plot, the directing and the characters, everything was perfect, I'm grateful i had the chance to watch The Shawshank Redemption!",8
It is simply a masterpiece classical forever It is a wonderful film in everything Director was wonderful Photography Representation Everything amazing This is a film of history you must watch it,10
"Best Movie Ever That i Watched On The Universe It is an unusual remark to make about a film set inside a jail, however ""The Shawshank Redemption"" makes a warm hang on our sentiments since it makes us an individual from a family. Numerous motion pictures offer us vicarious encounters and speedy, shallow feelings. ""Shawshank"" backs off and looks. It utilizes the storyteller's quiet, attentive voice to incorporate us in the narrative of men who have shaped a network in the slammer. It is more profound than most movies; about coherence in a lifetime, in view of companionship and expectation.",8
"This is a classic film with a strong sense of generation, far-reaching significance and unforgettable. Whenever I feel confused about life, I always think of this film. When I am confused and confused, I always see the film's hero crossing the sewer on a stormy night. Yes, maybe that's the invisible influence of the film; although the film has penetrating lenses on some ratings, it has not the slightest meaning expressed by the film. A movie about prison and embarrassment also has a good ending like many high-score movies. At the end of the film, the friends the hero met in prison were released on parole to fulfill his agreement with the hero, and they found an iron box. Finally, they met again on the blue Pacific coast. Although the ending was good, they also had a vengeful vent. Yeah, thanks for meeting it. It's unforgettable!",10
"This movie and the back to the future trilogy, is the best you can watch if you want a really good one. Clever, interesting, long but you dont realize it because is so well done and so interesting that you never get bored. I higly recomend to watch it if you didnt yet. For some reason is the number 1 ;). Watch it, you wont regreat.",10
"THis movie is one of the best that has been released over the last couple of decades and to me it is a timeless one as well. I truly believe that the story line and acting will hold up against anything out today, This movie provides viewers a story that is raw and emotional, though it is a simpler film than some it leaves an impression upon the viewer and touches something in the deepest part of our humanness.",10
"Great Movie, Great Actors, Great to re-watch over and over",10
"My favourite movie since I was a child. I can't imagine going into the profession of acting without the hundreds of viewings I seem to have given this title. Stellar acting and storytelling, not a single wasteful moment of screentime and the music choices were incredible.",10
"After watching useless film after useless film, I always come back to this. It acts as a benchmark and I must remind myself to watch it more as I find myself become more accommodating to the rubbish which is being released these days. How many films do you find yourself counting the minutes till the end or where the media has created a publicity storm to cloak the fact their film isn't worth the huge budget they spent on it? After watching King Kong at Christmas I felt depressed, as here was a truly bloated, poorly acted, lazily directed, piece of film which was getting rave reviews from the critics and public alike. Please feel free to argue against me, but the fact that so few are willing to state the obvious, that the film wasn't great, just alright at best, highlights a continuing trend in todays society, that of applauding mediocrity.",10
The best movie I've seen in my life and it deserves the highest rating.,9
"Greatttt Errrr... I guess that's supposed to be enemies. But in any case, who needs those extra nice-to-",10
Must Watch This is all about you cant make your eyes see any thing else. Its really amazing watching such content.,9
Good direction and perfect cinematography brings this movie at its best.,10
It just wonderfull.. iam recomend this movie This is one of the best films I've ever seen and I'd recommend everyone to see it,10
It was along time i was searching for movies that are worth spending your time.At last i really understood what i demanded when first i watched this movie a year ago.and it was my initial step to watch the best movies of the world.,8
This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!,10
"This movie is beyond epic , just good movie overall",10
"The Shawshank Redmption started out as an unknown movie, with little box-office money, average reviews and outcasted by two other fantastic films of the same year, "" FOREST GUMP "" and "" PULP FICTION "". The movie became a success when released on video and shown on television and is now considered as one of the best movies ever.

The story is about a man named Andy Dufrane, sent to Shawshank Redemption for the murder of his wife and her lover. Although the story seems very simple, its very gripping and engaging, and you want to watch it to the end.

In Shawshank Prison, we as the audience find lovable and characters we can relate and sympaphise with. Even though they are convicts, murderers, etc...

The acting is the strongest point in the film, as the characters played magnificently and uplifting by people Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

Overall, The Shawshank Redmption will always be considered one of the greatest movies ever made, and a personal favourite of mine",9
"Everyone should watch before they die.Morgan freeman one of the great actors in the world phenomenal acting, Tim Robbins inspiring character.",10
Its one of the greatest movies i ever seen. Its a combination of a perfect work of everyone from the director until the last one of the team. I wish we see other works like this in the sooner future,10
"So so incredible and i really wish it was more than its original length,i enjoyed it so so much incredible cast and beautiful set.",10
"Why it is greatest movie ever made.
No beautiful heroine in movie.
No nudity.
No good looking hero also (with 6 pack abs).
No love story. (Remember it release in 1994)
It is era of love story movie yet no single second of love story in this epic movie.
. . And so on. may be there are movie in future with 4-5 Billion dollar grossing, but never beat this movie.",10
"Fantastic film but honestly, I don't see why it's number one on IMDb. 8 at best",1
"The Shawshank Redemption was one of those movies that I had heard the title to at some point in my life, though knew nothing about. One day, I was scrolling through Hulu and came across it. I decided to watch it. This was one of the best decisions that I could have made. It was enthralling to follow Andy throughout his journey in prison, and I loved that Morgan Freeman was not only a major part of the storyline, but he narrated it, and it followed his story as well. I have seen this twice now, and would definitely watch it again.",10
What can you say about this film. spawned from a short story by Stephen King and adapted into this pure masterpiece with amazing acting - highly recommend,9
Movie holds you till end.... The performances are good,10
"Such an amazing film,recommend to watch! I watched it with my family and it was the best thing I ever watched in my life, I found it so interesting but cool at the same time",8

"GOOD MOVIE....... ..... SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE, PICTURISING IS GOOD,AND CINEMATOPAGRAPHY IS GOOD",10
"I think I have seen this movie five times. Last week I decided to watch it again and after deciding to do so, I was afraid that it wouldn't live up to my well known expectations. What a mistake.

The story, the acting, the music, the message, etc. : everything was even more stunning than I'd hoped it to be. Huge waves of emotions. Simply incredible. Nothing less.

This is a film that touches everyone that is lucky enough to take the time to watch it. This is a film about the struggle that life can be sometimes. We all run in into trouble sooner or later and this film is a healer that gives you new hope. O, and don't forget to take notice the double moral that we all know so well from those very 'religious' people.

Sorry for sounding a little hyper, but this film deserves it.

Check it out!",10

One of the best movies that I've ever seen! I can't forget the first time I've seen.. I think I seen it like 3 times since I first saw it back in the days..,10
"I consider myself an avid movie-watcher with mostly mainstream choices for my favorite movies. One of my favorite genres is inspirational movies like Rudy, Contact, and October Sky. Tops on my list of any genre is The Shawshank Redemption. One of the driving factors that it tops my list is because, like everyone else, I watched the movie on video with absolutely no expectations. At the time I had not seen a review, trailer, commercial, or even the cover of the video box for the movie. My wife went to the video store for me to rent it only because I heard it got nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. We popped the movie in around 11:00 p.m., thinking we will fall asleep during the movie. Well, two hours later, the only way we could describe the movie would be inspirational. After the movie, I started to notice the commercials, the posters, and the box cover all gave references to the crucial twist at the end. I think if I saw any of these things before I watched the movie then I would have put 2 and 2 together and it would have made the movie less enjoyable. Word of mouth is the reason why it has been such a hit on video, and in the future will be the reason it will be considered on of the greatest movies of all time.",10
This is such an amazing movie I have ever seen. The director and all other crew knows how to integrate audience with story.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a classic though-and-though. Stellar performances from it's protagonists in a bleak yet hopeful setting helps the viewer to really tune-in to the humanity of the film. At the core, this film is about freedom from strife in a strife-stricken situation. Watching this film is enough to cure anyone of the blues. Highly recommended.",10
"One of the best movies made. It also provides a beautiful analogy for a common (mis)management practice. See this movie and put your job in perspective. We are all Andy, being used by our bosses to advance themselves, shown off to their friends, etc. but never really given any actual credit, and held in place by those same bosses, lest they lose the status that keeping us under them provides...

Or you can just see it because it's good. Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is great.",8
It keeps you tight. It's one of the best movies available.,9
"I've first watched this film in English class while I was on a student exchange. I think it was because of this film and my teacher, that I wanted to get more into the writing process of films.

It became one of my favourite movies, and I'm obsessed with showing it to my friends.",10
"I first saw SR in america when i was 12. I walked in on the tariing scene and had to stay up untill two in the morning to finish watching it. I was hooked! When i came back to england i rushed out and bought the Video in order to see the beginning part. it is such a great movie. i have seen the movie about 250 times since then and have read the short story about 100 times. it is so good! if you haven't seen it yet, make sure you do. You are missing out on one of the greatest cinematic treats in history!",10
"Best movie in the world, Everyone should see atleast once in their lifetime best screenplay , best direction, best acting. Must Watch",8
"This is one not to miss. I was also shocked to learn that this was written by Stephen King! The acting is superb and the ending is fantastic. It's not your typical prison film but has heart and depth beyond the normal Hollywood picture.

If I were to venture out on a limb, this is almost a perfect film.",10
"This film expresses from the theme level, let the audience deeply realize what hope is and what hope is important to a person! The beginning of the film is very suspenseful and characteristic. Until the film sees the middle section, the audience really understands that the protagonist is not the murderer who killed his wife.",10
"Absolutely forever changed my life due to this movie. It is a movie of hope redemption and deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red. They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison. As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy. His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.",10
How to describe a movie like this - other than simply amazing? Always recommends this one to people who haven't seen it yet!,10
This serie is the best serie for me.. i love any series with action and intelligence,8
"I was finally able to watch this film, let me tell you it is an amazing cinamatic masterpiece. Recommend this film!",9
"Great movie! I could watch it so many times.

My favorite part is the beginning middle and end",7

Great film watched it twice with my family and didn't get tired of it which is always a good sign. would recommend .,10
"I simply have no words for this one. I didn't see it for the longest for the fear of being disappointed but boy was I wrong. Everything from casting to acting to dialogue and directing, its perfect and worth how many ever times you might want to watch it.",9
"Pretty good, i really enjoyed it and i also think its inspiring for many people and really motivational",10
Masterpiece. No words needed. Muse see for everybody.,9
I'm only here for duty. But this is the best movie I've ever seen. v2,10
One of the best movies i have ever saw and the best acting skills shown by actors and interesting story,10
I love this movie from childhood..its is historical movie ever!!,10
My best one and will be the best one till death! Now I am getting busy for living!,10
Just an outstanding performance by the actors along with a perfect storyline. It is recommended for anyone who wants to watch a survival movie with beautifully awesome ending.,10
This movie is not just a movie I suppose. It gave me inspiration and hope. It has taught me to never give up. And has taught me to keep my hopes up and work hard in the hardest time of my life.,1
"Yea, i recently viewed this movie. it was one of the best movie i ever seen.",8
If you haven't seen the movie Papiolon then this review is not for you. I try not to compare Papilon and Shawshank Redemption but most of you will agree with me that there are bits of story or narrative elemnts that runs simultaneously in this film. Both films have a succesful business man being acused of a crime and then being thrown into jail where they make new friends. Both story also shows how the main characters try to escape from prison. However The DShawshank stoodout from the normal narrative of the hollywood classicall system. The hollywood three act structre was recreated in a mster piece style. Papilon had a normal way of narrating the story but Shawshank Redemption treated this film differently even though the story lines had some similarities.,10
I think this is one of the most favorite movies I've ever seen.,8
This film is an example of Stephen King at his absolute best! The music and cinematography are also top drawer. You cannot help but get drawn in by the characters in the piece and genuinely begin to feel the longing and hopelessness of prison life in this era. One of my top 25 movies of all time!,9
"One of the best movie I have seen. Won't ruin the motion picture, yet when it gets all the more broadly discharged, this is certainly a decent contender for your end of the week at the theater. An exceptionally reviving motion picture that addresses the general subject of family and love, yet from an Eastern setting in China and parts of it in America.",10
Very good film!! You can see it and will never be in misery,10
"Very good movie ,I've seen it twice .definitely worth about 10/10 it's worth seeing it once.",10
This movie is very Good and I watched Multiple Times,10
Looking foward to watching! It looks amazing already!,10
"A must see if you're even wondering. This will also become one of your favorites. Great characters, acting, screenplay, everything. They did a great job of getting Kings book to the screen. One of the best and most memorable endings in movie history. Sit back, dim lights, shut off phone, and enjoy!",10
"Its a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message",10
This film is like the ultimate story of patience and loyalty. I give this story 2 thumbs up.,10
"This is one of those movies every man should see before they die. I love this movie.

Recommended !!!",10
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. the ending was really great. the cast was really well put together,10
This film has earned it's place being on top. It's hard to think of any faults.,10
This is a must see title for anyone. Amazing in every way!,10
"I am big fan of this kind of films! And I used to love 'The Count Of Monte Cristo' so much when I was a kid! And later I watched this film! Though it's not the same, but I love it so much!!",10
"This is one of the best movies ever. It has everything you could ask for. Drama, Superior Acting, a sprinkle of comedy. Absolute perfection.",8
"Awesome!i want to watch more story related to this movie.Tied for the best movie I have ever seen carflo26 November 2003 Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.

I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.

The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",10
"I believe a movie of this magnitude deserves a sequel while its main characters are still alive. If you agree with this, support me by pressing ""Yes"".",10
"This is one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen in my life. Something special happens when the writing, directing and acting all comes together. If you have not seen it, you're in for a treat!",10
"I was amazed, encaptured and enthralled when I saw this film for the first time. I was flicking idly through the television one night when I caught the opening titles just as I was about to go to bed, and thought I'd give it a try. What can I say? 3 hours later I was almost in tears over the ending, but I'll say no more.

It's obvious the film has overwhelming themes of hope, friendship, redemption ad freedom, but it is the hope that so suffuses the film and lifts it above other ""triumphing over adversity"" films. It is a film that does not try to justify any governmental or judicial system, or the skill of a lawyer, but simply the hope and compassion that is part of the tarnished human spirit.

I bought this film on DVD recently, replacing my rather elderly tape, and it cost me the grand total of £3 (about $5 or so) and, pound for pound, it's the best value for money I've ever spent on anything. If only all DVD's were this good and this cheap.",9
The Shashank Redemption is my favorite movie. The drama and Crime in this movie is just ridicoulus.,10
One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's old but gold.,10
A wonderful film! There's so much to learn from it. I enjoyed every minutes of it. Everyone should watch it. I did it 3 times and for sure I will watch it again in the futures as it has the power to uplift my soul whenever I need it.,10
"First and foremost , the shawshank redemption is a brilliant piece of film-making. It follows the story of andy dufresne(an excellent tim robbins) and his struggle to maintain hope inside a maximum secruity prison.It also focuses on his friendship with the prison""fixer"" red(beautifully portrayed by morgan freeman). It has such an intelligent script that makes the film`s final appeal the indefinable quality of ""feel good"". Frank darabont must be wondering what he has to do to win an oscar now as he has also made the excellent ""green mile"". I dont really want to say too much about the story as i will let you discover the twist and turns that happen in shawshank prison.But i will say something , i was totally gobsmacked by the extraordinary twist in the tale. If you have not yet seen the film , forget about renting it , GO BUY IT ON VIDEO AND DVD NOW and enjoy 137 minutes of the greatest film ever made.",10
"I haven't seen this movie for almost three years. But every time I tell all my friends with confidence that they will not be disappointed by watching this film. And, probably, I will recommend it to everyone for many, many more years, because The Shawshank Redemption is among the first on my list of the best films. Looking at the ratings, you can say that the majority absolutely agrees with me. Director Frank Darabont did a great job, this is the best adaptation of Stephen King I've ever seen. And the actors, as the actors are selected, all, down to episodic roles, played wonderfully. And the tandem of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is a completely different story to talk about. Complementing one another, they, as a whole, were able to play on the strings of my soul a melody that I will never forget. I would like to see them together again, in a new film, in the lead roles. But, alas and ah, it seems that all this will remain only in dreams. And we are destined to enjoy their tandem only within the walls of the Shawshank prison. I think to retell and talk about the plot, I think it makes no sense, since many of you, I'm sure, have already watched this movie. Let me just talk about the finale. The first time I saw it, I just gasped. Then he looked again, and gasped again. And even when I watch it, I don't know how many times, I am again surprised that I see this film for the first time.

One of the masterpieces of world cinema, which forever left its mark on the hearts of moviegoers in all countries of the planet earth.

10/10.",10

I don't personally care for prison movies but it was a great storyline and well directed. I'm not in the movie business or producer so take my opinion very lightly please.,10
"7,095th review of this movie. Never got around to review but after some time... This film is truly beautifully filmed. With the development of each character throughout the movie you'll only grow for the love of each one of them. Very poetic movie and resolves every loose end with everything that went on. Very detailed movie that if you miss a scene you will miss a piece of the puzzle. Easily a 10/10.",10
The greatest movie I've ever seen. The story is great the choice of actors is the scenario is it's just a masterpiece.,10

Will not be able to stop watching for one second spellbinding,10
"Great movie and absolute must see! One of Morgan Freeman's best performances and an all around amazing production. Cast and direction all on point. This, like the green mile, began as a simple short story and was made in to an epic film. Takes a man wrongly convicted of a crime and tells an epic story of his struggle to survive in prison after a life sentence. If you like Stephen king, you might have mixed feelings about this one. For fans of his usual supernatural horror stories...this is far and away from that type of storyline. However, if you like a movie with great story and plot twists that rival that of The Usual Suspects, then buckle up and watch this one! You really can't go wrong here.",10
"Wonderful movie, I like it a lot.this story is amazing",7
This is one of the greatest movies that I've ever seen! Every second of it is worth-watching.,10
"Perfect performances from Freeman and Robbins! Great use of a real prison in Mansfield Ohio, The Ohio State Reformatory.",8
"That is so nice movie, It make me become stronger, no master what situation will be, always be positive in life and find the way to solve the problem",10
No wonder why this is the highest rated movie. One of the best movie I have ever seen.,10
Lost count of the number of times I've seen this film and how many people I've talked with about this film. Legendary movie and will stay in the top 5 of the greatest films ever made for a very long time.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It's dark, yet hopeful. Bleak, yet empovering. I highly recommend this to everyone who loves a good crime/drama.",10
Amazing work movie! That was based on story movie.,10
All in this film is perfect. The story catches you everytime you see it.,10
Amazing Film! I thought the film told a realistic story while also adding great acting thought out the film.,10
"It is sad to admit, but in case of this film, ratings are wrong. It is really good picture, but it don't desrve to be on top 1.",10
"I watch this movie for minimum 2-3 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc.",10
This film is great. It is also one of my favorites.,10
"It's remarkable to the performance of both two actors - ""Andy"" & ""Red"" !!",8
It's a masterpiece. Great direction and great acting. Movie holds you till the end. I saw this film while studying film and media since then I am in love with this film. A must watch.,10
"The only movie I've ever rated a '10', Reference Standard.

Regardless of my own interpretation of this art, I say ""Greatest Masterpiece Ever Filmed."" with confidence based on the numbers and insightful comments posted by other viewers. Indeed, it is only a matter of time before this movie surpasses 'The Godfather' as being rated as the 'Top All-Time' movie on the top movie website.

With that said, there is nothing I can add to the hundreds of comments posted before me. Everything about this piece from the rich story and character development to the symphonic climax should be studied by anyone interested in film. You simply must view this movie--and view it with a critical eye--as a reference standard of quality story telling.",10
Good film I recommand it to other guys you should watch it,10
The name of the show is excellent fitted for the show itself cant complain,10
Shawshank Redemption is just honestly an amazing film.,10
"For the first time in my life, there was a movie that I watched over and over again The film is fictional but contains interesting life philosophies. The film creates a strong heart for those who are feeling stuck in life",10
"This movie is simply fantastic, everything about it was great it had a great plot, great character inside and development. The plot progression was also marvelous it is one of if not the best movie I have ever watched, and one of the good things about it is that you can watch it over and over and every time you spot more details and get a better overview of how fantastic the movie actually is. Also the attention to detail in the adaptation compared to the book is on point, nothing is missing or overlooked everything is just there. I would 100% recommend giving it a watch, it can be by yourself with friends or with family, if you give it a try and don't like it there are other movies out there better suited for you.",10
"This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE movie ever. My children (whom also love it) will not watch it with me because I say the lines all the way through. I LOVE Morgan Freeman's voice, just something very comforting to me, like home. The part where Red is describing how Andy got out just fills my heart and to see Andy's smile at the end bring it full circle! If you like this I would suggest: Murder in the First (Kevin Bacon) and The Last Castle (Robert Redford) both very different even though they are prison based and same era based movies they go in different directions. I do not live very far from the prison in SR. My mom did some kind of day trip/tour there and bought a small hard bound book that had been used as a prop in the library scene (just sitting on the shelf with others not actually ""used"" in the movie)",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" ( 1994) takes you on a journey to everywhere you want to be and nowhere you want to be at the same time.",10

It is worth seeing over ... if you have not rewatched you should.,9
"Even just a trailer make me feel curious already. after watch the movie, i feel really great!",1
I first saw this masterpiece two years ago and since then it has been on my favourite movie list. This is one of those movies that once you see it you can't stop watching it. It has a very very good story line. The only thing that is bad about this movie is that most people have to see it from the beginning to like it and really appreciate it.,9
"This is the best movie i have ever seen, because of the purity of the scenario and the stresses. The film emphasizes nearly all good and bad characteristics of the human in a way that everybody can understand and taste. I felt myself like i was there and the camera was my eyes.

Everbody who wants to learn more about the value of the virtues he/she house , must see this film before he or she dies.",5
Think this is the best movie that I have ever seen. This movie gives me strong motivation to get better in future.,8
"This is my most favorite move of all time! It's mysterious and twisting, just like Stephen King is. I would recommend this movie to all Stephen King fans. The characters are perfectly chosen for this movie.",6

I have watch this movie many time and it is great. So I will definitely recommend it to all people,10
This is one of the really great movies. Excellent casting. The actors worked together to form an exceptional cast. Telling the story through the eyes of another inmate added a pleasurable twist to the movie. Definitely one of the core films of any video library.,10
"Shawshank Redeption is the one of the best movies in the history of cinema. However, I think this is not the best!",7
The way he got out is really impressive and unexpected.,10

"In a world saturated with cinematic masterpieces, it takes something truly exceptional to stand out. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994), directed by Frank Darabont and adapted from Stephen King's novella, is a shining beacon of such rarity. With its evocative storytelling and unforgettable characters, this epic drama transcends genres and cements itself in the annals of film history. It is not just a movie, but a symphony of emotions - one that will make you laugh, weep, and ultimately, revel in the indomitable human spirit.

The plot unwinds in the confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary, a place where hopes and dreams go to wither and die. But for Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an enigmatic and falsely accused banker, this prison serves as a crucible of metamorphosis. His journey of self-discovery and friendship with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) is the heart and soul of the movie. Through their eyes, we are shown a world where friendship blooms in the harshest conditions, and hope becomes an act of defiance.

As the prison walls close in on the inmates, the film's cinematography takes our breath away. The sweeping shots of the imposing penitentiary and the iconic scene of Andy standing triumphant in the rain will forever be etched in our collective memory. The movie paints a vivid portrait of the inescapable human condition; our laughter is juxtaposed with heart-wrenching tears, and our fears are confronted by the resolute power of hope.

But what truly sets ""The Shawshank Redemption"" apart is its mastery of storytelling. The narrative is at once a riveting tale of camaraderie and an allegory of the human spirit's resilience. With every seemingly inconsequential detail weaved into the fabric of the story, Darabont brings King's novella to life with a finesse that leaves the audience spellbound. The movie's dramatic crescendo - the masterful escape of Andy - is a cinematic tour de force, an exhilarating testament to the power of hope and determination.

The ensemble cast is nothing short of extraordinary, led by Robbins and Freeman, who infuse their characters with quiet dignity and raw vulnerability. Their performances are imbued with grace and gravitas, making their friendship a beacon of light in the abyss of despair. The supporting cast, including Bob Gunton as the merciless Warden Norton and Clancy Brown as the brutal Captain Hadley, offers a compelling portrayal of the darker side of human nature.

As the end credits roll, one cannot help but be left awestruck by the film's hauntingly beautiful score, composed by Thomas Newman. His melodies linger long after the screen fades to black, serving as a poignant reminder of the emotional odyssey we have just witnessed.

In the pantheon of great cinema, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" stands proud as an enduring testament to the power of friendship and the unyielding resilience of the human spirit. It is a story that transcends time and space, a tale of redemption that reaches into the very depths of our souls. As you laugh and cry, remember that in the darkest of times, hope will always find a way. This film is not just a masterpiece; it is the quintessential human experience, immortalized on celluloid for eternity.",4
"Prepared to be bored. i disliked this very much. zero thrill, zero meaning.",9
"It's fine. Not bad, the story is good, the plot is wonderful, not the best, but it is not bad.",7
I like the script and the way it handles the plot..,7
It is a masterpeace. I never saw a better movie than this one.,10
"Well, it's been a while since I wanted to watch this movie because of the repetition of the recommendation and I can say that this movie deserves all of these good rates.",10
This Film is really Amazing. I almost watched 20 times . Every time I watched this Film I discover something new.,10
"One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption",10
"After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P. S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s.",10
"Thank you 10th grade art teacher! Very cool. But also, couldn't you think of another movie to put on? Like cool movie and all but I swear whenever there was a movie it was always shawshank redemption. Very cool but also not very cool.",9
"I really heard too many opinions about this movie some says it's overrated others says it's the best movie they have ever seen every side is giving their reasons ,but my view to the movie it's perfect not like it's impossible to make like it again but it's perfect like it's the best thing we have ever done . The movie calls for life anywhere even in jail which wouldn't be the end if you ended up there, the lawyer the main character could make life inside jail life maybe is better than lives could prisoners with him can have outside the jail and then there is a question ,, what does prison means does is place you cant' physical move out or the only prison we make is by our brains to be trapped in our thoughts , beliefs and other customs we have in our life routine life .",10
A pretty good film this is exactly wat I've been looking for in a movie.,10
"What a beautiful movie. I can watch this movie over and over. There is not one thing wrong with this picture. The beautiful settings. The talented cast. And I have to say Stephen King's greatest screenplay. Tim Robbins plays the role of a life time. I love how he plays an innocent criminal as he quietly escapes from a prison and returns to a normal life. Morgan Freeman was powerful. His wonderful sounding voice eases the audience through out the movie. A story of a friendship between 2 convicted murderers over 30 years. I also love how elements of horror were added to this movie to have a true feel to a Stephen King movie. The part where the guy gets dragged back into the cell is more haunting then any horror version of that same shot. This is a must watch for everyone. No matter where you catch this movie. Beginning, middle, or, end, it is worth watching. <3",10
"I've seen the film years ago, but I enjoy watching it again.",10
"I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and I will probably watch it a dozen more. It is a feel good movie with excellent acting. I am a huge Tim Robbins fan and Morgan Freeman does a superb job as ""the man who can get things"". The majority of the supporting cast were just as good. The storyline is honest and fun. I believe most people will enjoy what this film has to offer. If you think you might be turned off because this is a prison movie please reconsider. I doubt that once you've seen the movie you will consider it a cliché prison flick. Most movies today are entirely too predictable. This movie is guaranteed to surprise and excite as the plot and ending unfold.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 USA drama film, written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman (both are great actors for me).

It is ranked #1 in IMDb's ""Top 250"" list and is considered one of the best movies of all time.

For me It's a great movie, I really don't understand how this movie couldn't have win an Oscar, although we all know that it is more fake. Recommended for everyone to see it, has a little of everything, you can also realize sometimes justice is not done correctly.

Many people'll claim that The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made, and it is difficult to argue against it, however, everyone should watch this film at least once or two in their lives.",10

Considered a classic for so many reasons. Great Movie,6
I saw this very good and nice. I will introduce to my friend this film,10
"There is only 1 plus in this movie, it is there is no minus.",10
"Written by Darabont on the basis of a story by Stephen King contained in the anthology Different Seasons, The Shawshank Redemption is a perfectly balanced prison movie. An excellent script, a good direction, perfect scenarios (the one that in the film is the Shawshank prison in Maine, is actually a prison located in Ohio, used for filming) and a fast pace. Brilliant.",9
Would say it again and again. cannot get bored of it.,10
"On Sept. 23, 1994, after a premiere at the Toronto film fest, The Shawshank Redemption hit theaters nationwide. The Morgan Freeman film eventually nabbed seven Oscar nominations. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below:

Castle Rock has tapped into the wellspring of yet another Stephen King novella, from the same collection as Stand by Me. While it seems unlikely that this well-wrought film about hope and friendship in a maximum security prison will do Stand by Me-level business, The Shawshank Redemption should appeal to a mature audience. The marketing challenge will be to lure a mainstream audience to this dark drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman with, to boot, an enigmatic title.

Covering a span of time from 1946 to 1967, Shawshank focuses on the plight of a Maine banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), sentenced to two life terms for the murder of his wife and lover. Laconic and a bit chilly, Andy is somewhat of an outcast among the uneducated, macho thugs who make up the main brunt of the prison population.

Admittedly, he's not an easy guy to get to know and only comes to enjoy a prison friendship when he makes a deal with the prison black-market supplier, Red (Freeman), to get him a tiny hammer for his rock collection. Red is also an enigma to most of the inmates. He keeps his nose clean and his hopes up even though the parole board routinely denies him pardon, obviously a racial antagonism.

While the story roils with some rousing prison-type action and is coarsened by an overpowering sense of frustration, The Shawshank Redemption is really about the unlikely friendship between Andy and Red: Each nurtures the other and serves as a touchstone for keeping their sanity intact.

Frank Darabont's writing and direction are generally crisp, but Shawshank is a tough watch and audiences could use some time cut from its 142 minutes.",8
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.,10
"It's really hard not to write an angry review! I can't believe this movie is number 1 on IMDB. The story felt so fake that it was impossible for me to get into it. And the aesthetic of the movie is really not interesting. So many movies are better, this ranking is absolutely absurd ! This movie should not be number one, it's shouldn't even be in the top 250!

This movie brought me nothing but deception.",10
"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking 's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.",10
"Out of usa, this movie never has ranked as high! it is great movie, indeed but not a classic as the godfather, or other WORLD WIDE acclaimed!",10
"It sure would be a shame to go though life without seeing The Shawshank Redemption. It is a classic that draws emotions from start to finish. It is a long film, but you still won't want it to end. I will be watching again soon!",10
Awesome Movie. I can saw the movie everyday without sick.,10
"I like this movie so much because perfect rolplay, perfect actors, perfect fiction and perfect story.",10
"Shawshank redemption was not just a movie, it's an emotion. Without any mass, action, technical quality etc, they made us to believe that films can also touches our heart without any mass.",9
I love this movie. The actors are amazing and made this seem as if i was within the movie. Thank you oh so much for the performance. Till this day i am still watching this movie over and over.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that will send the viewer through multiple emotions with its multi-layered fascinating plot. I often get asked by those who haven't seen the film: ""what's it about?"", but I never know how to answer that question. The truth is that I don't feel that I can briefly summarise such a stunning beautiful film whilst doing it full justice. All I can say is that I can guarantee that if you don't love it, that you will at least very much like it. It's no fluke that this film stands at #1 in the IMDb top 250.

Despite deservedly winning a mere 14 awards, unfortunately this will always be one of the best films in history to have not won an Oscar, but don't let that affect your opinion.",10
"I've read a number of the other user comments on this movie, and I was glad to see that every one of them regarded the movie as one of the best they've ever seen. The fact that 100% of the reviews I saw all rated this movie as somewhere beyond excellent says it all. I like all sorts of films, from serious to goofy comedies, but my list of the best films of the last 15 or so years includes the heavy hitters like Rain Man, Unforgiven, Jerry Maguire, Good Will Hunting, Murder In The First (because of Kevin Bacon's awe-inspiring performance) and Saving Private Ryan, which are all fabulous movies. But Shawshank tops them all by a good margin. It is, without a doubt, that good.

I'm also an avid reader, one of those who thinks that the book almost always far outshines the movie, no matter how good the movie. And Shawshank is one of my favorite stories by my favorite author, but this movie takes the story to a completely new level. I've never encountered another written or filmed work that better shows the 'triumph of the spirit' theme.

There are a number of deeply moving scenes in the movie, but for me, the climax of the movie, the point where everything comes together, is when Morgan Freeman's character is released from prison and contemplating killing himself. He finally comes to understand (or maybe just to accept) something that Tim Robbins' character told him earlier, and he says, ""Get busy living... or get busy dying. That's goddamn right."" This line starts a sequence that leads up to what, in my opinion, is the most perfect ending ever filmed.

Every aspect of this movie is of the highest caliber. The script is excellent, the acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is incredible, the musical score is flawless, and the direction is obviously superb. What's even more incredible is that this was Frank Darabont's first feature film - and he surely rose above to make this one. Forrest Gump won the Oscars it did because of its sentimentality and the nostalgic look at American history. It did NOT win because it was the best picture of that year. I had no problem with Tom Hanks winning the best actor award, but Shawshank should have won every other award it was nominated for. I though Forrest Gump was excellent, but Shawshank was so much better that its getting beat out for best picture is on a par with Shakespeare In Love beating Saving Private Ryan.

Well, I'll get off my soap box now. I would have no problem going on with how moving and beautifully-done this movie is, but I think you probably get the point by now.",10
"How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.

This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.",9
"Simply put. The most amazing film ever made...It doesn't matter how many times I've seen Shawshank, it always pulls me in to watch it, again and again. When you have a perfectly written script. The best actors. A dedicated director with a vision. Shawshank is the end result. Simply perfect.",10

"The Shawshank Redemption is the 1994 movie about the banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins). Andy finds himself being accused of the murder of his cheating wife and her lover. After being convicted of both murders, Andy is sentenced to two life sentences at the dark Shawshank Penitentiary. He is mostly a quiet man and only talks to a few men in prison. Early on, Andy meets Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). Red is the man in prison who can get things from the outside and knows how the prison runs. He may be a step above the inmates and a step below the guards, but deals with both to keep everyone satisfied. Throughout Andy's years in prison, he has many projects that he works on, starting on maybe the hardest--surviving. From the very beginning of his incarceration, Andy has to fight off the prison gang 'The Sisters' who try to isolate Andy so the can sexually have their way with him. After the leader is finally taken care of by the guards, Andy is left alone to work on other ventures. Andy decides to take up an old hobby and start carving rocks in chess pieces by using the rock hammer he received from Red. He is later given an office job of assistant librarian after doing taxes for the warden and all the prison guards. During these years, Andy writes to state legislators to get the prison money for a better library and helps many inmates receive a high school education. Andy soon finds out that the warden is corrupt and helps him launder money, but makes sure the warden doesn't find out about his plans that he is willing to carry out at the end of the movie. This is very dark movie and shows both the good and bad sides of living out a life sentence. The movie has a message about how some men become part of the prison and cannot live without it. It shows that people can get mentally attached to the worst the world has to offer.",9
"I'm not much of a film critic so ill only write a few lines.

This film is amazing, the script is by far the best ever, the story-line is so original. The acting is done superbly especially Morgan Freeman. The characters are really written well, and the film will keep you guessing about what is going to happen next. The ending is truly amazing! If you have not seen this film yet, SEE IT!

10/10",8
"Even tho the movie is a bit old , it still holds up his rank. The story is absolutely incredible, and to those who are intrested in prison movies, this is a must see. I wont spoil anything, and if you can go past the little mistakes that are made here and there (i mean its 27 years movie, so its quite alright), you should definitely give it a shot. The script is pretty solid , and actors are on point(for a 27 years old movie remember). A very nice one this is.",10
"Yes it might contain some clichés and be somewhat predictable but this film is an absolute masterpiece and it is a clear leader at the top of my list of best films of all time. It is only a travesty that it didn't win the Oscars it deserved because of the hype surrounding Forrest Gump that year (not knocking FG because it is a great film also).

This is the only film ever that everyone I meet agrees is a brilliant movie. If you are just coming out of the jungle or have been locked in a basement at the hands of a crazed lunatic for years and you somehow are one of the few people on the planet who hasn't seen this movie then you have to change that right now !

Watch it and Love it.",9

It's not only a movie it's a great perspective, it gives one of the finest messages in life and i guarantee that most of the people will relate to this movie (not the prison part).

"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.",10

"The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont, is a cinematic masterpiece that has captured the hearts of audiences worldwide since its release in 1994. Based on Stephen King's novella, the film tells the gripping story of Andy Dufresne, a banker wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary. With its stellar performances, compelling narrative, and profound themes, The Shawshank Redemption has become a beloved classic that stands the test of time.

At the heart of The Shawshank Redemption lies its captivating narrative, which seamlessly weaves together elements of friendship, hope, resilience, and the quest for freedom. The film brilliantly portrays the harsh realities of prison life while also exploring the human capacity for redemption. Tim Robbins delivers a remarkable performance as Andy Dufresne, a man who maintains his innocence and refuses to let the prison system break his spirit. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Ellis ""Red"" Redding, Andy's fellow inmate and narrator, adds depth and warmth to the story, as he becomes a pillar of friendship and guidance for Andy. The film expertly develops a rich ensemble of characters, each with their own struggles and complexities, making them relatable and deeply human.

One of the most remarkable aspects of The Shawshank Redemption is its ability to evoke a range of emotions within the audience. From moments of despair and injustice to instances of triumph and camaraderie, the film takes viewers on an emotional rollercoaster. It delves into profound themes such as the power of hope, the resilience of the human spirit, the corrupt nature of institutions, and the importance of personal redemption. The film's exploration of these themes leaves a lasting impact, forcing us to reflect on our own lives and the choices we make.

Frank Darabont's direction is nothing short of masterful. He skillfully navigates between intense prison scenes and quiet moments of contemplation, creating a perfect balance that keeps the audience engaged throughout. The cinematography by Roger Deakins beautifully captures the oppressive atmosphere of the prison, juxtaposing it with breathtaking shots that symbolize freedom and hope. The film's visual aesthetics, combined with a hauntingly beautiful score by Thomas Newman, further enhance the overall cinematic experience.

The Shawshank Redemption's universal message of hope and redemption resonates with audiences across generations and cultures. Its exploration of the human condition, the longing for freedom, and the search for meaning in life transcends time and societal boundaries. The film serves as a reminder that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is always a glimmer of hope and the possibility for redemption. Its enduring popularity and widespread acclaim are a testament to its cultural relevance and ability to touch the hearts of viewers worldwide.

In the realm of cinema, The Shawshank Redemption stands tall as an exceptional film that continues to captivate audiences with its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and profound themes. It serves as a timeless reminder of the human capacity for resilience, friendship, and redemption. The film's ability to evoke a wide range of emotions, combined with its expert direction, beautiful cinematography, and thought-provoking narrative, solidifies its status as a true masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that deserves to be celebrated and cherished for generations to come.",10
"A movie that you can watch as many as you want. It has some marvelous lines and its one of the which you can give 10 out of 10. It will cheer you, motivate you and let you know the beauty of life and freedom.",10
It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Watching very impressed!,10
"I wish I'd known about this movie when it came out but I actually didn't even get to watch it until about ten years after it premiered after reading a Stephen King novel of short stories but it was called ""Rita Hayward and the Shawshank Redemption"" in there. I became enamored with the novel and immediately turned on to look for it and lucky for me it was about to start on TNT I believe, and I immediately went out and purchased the DVD at the Wal-Mart bargain bin for $5.00. This is an absolute gem of a movie and you will not be disappointed in any of the acting or the storyline, not going to give any spoilers but I urge you to watch it ASAP if you haven't yet but make there aren't kids around as this is a prison story and prison life is no fairytale.",9

"Yo, this movie good Yo yo y should watch it Hello ye no yes maybe ye ye noo.",10
"Top 10 film. Of all the 'prison break ' scenarios this film presents a depth filled view of cunning intelligence, greed , and perseverance.",9
I watched this movie many times. When I watched this movie first time I admire Andy that free him self from prison. Then time to time I respect the Red character. He says hope is dangerous thing. When Andy got out of hole. That was most realistic true thing to say his friend. In real life Andy Dufresne is most rare character. But Red character is common. You can find easily the person their hope and dreams. End of the movie Red is try to hope and dream for many years been forgotten. He finally feel himself as a normal person. Hoping and dreaming is very precious thing in human life.,10
Its really really good movie. please do watch it. the movie i have ever seen that effects me as strongly. its really impressive and good movie. please do watch everyone.,10
"The shawshank reredumption is like my favourite movie. Whenever i need hope i remember this movie.

No wonder that this movie is the highest rated movies of all time. I recommed this movie as a must watch movie.

I love it and i hope that you all will also love it. I really wanted this review to be short and beautiful.

But the restriction of 600 words have prevented it. So,this movie is also a family friendly movie. I watched it with my elder sister.

I think that we more of these types of movies.

The acting was just too good.

It looks like every one gave their best to make this movie a masterpiece and ofcourse highest rated movie.",10
"This is one of the best drama movies I've ever seen. It seems that Stephen King's jail novels are always a success movies, as The Green mile was even better than this. Homewer, these two movies are so different they really can't be compared.

Tim Robbins plays one of his best (if not the best of all) roles and I could not imagine anyone else to this role. The story is stunning and this time, the movie is actually better than the book.

When you start to watch this film, you can't stop, until the film ends. That describes how interesting and addictive this movie is. I recommend this to anyone, except to the most eager action fans.",10
In my opinion this movie is like to lots of movie in this genre .I no know what people choice this for best movie and I grade to this movie for actor's act was wonderful,10
A great great movie with lots of points about life.,10
Very good movie over all it keeps you interested though out the movie never gets boring,10
"Probably my favourite movie ever and I'm happy to see that many others agree. I am not a movie buff and I don't have the most conventional taste in movies, and I am very peculiar about the right time and place to watch a movie, but this one always seem to fit whatever mood I'm in or whoever I'm watching it with. It has amazing pacing and dialogue, which is more often than not my gripe with ""older movies"". It is one of the few classics that I feel deserves the praise and recognition it had garnered, but that opinion most definitely differs from individual to individual. For me, this film is one of a kind and there won't be an another one quite like it. But of course I have other movies that I like a great deal too and that are also in leagues of their own (also untouchable, in a way), so I'll celebrate that movies can be vastly different and remember that even ""perfect"" movies should never be above criticism!",10
"This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. Well written , great story lie with some of th4 best acting by all. Worth seeing again.",1
"Try to hold on some beliefs before they are lost.They may not come to pass, they may not allow us to live more meaningfully -- and even for me, they only bring me more emptiness.But I know how much I need this hypocrisy and self-deception, because you can say I'm dreaming, but I won't be the only one.",7
"I saw this movie a while ago. Best movie ever. I enjoyed it and still remember every scenes. If you haven't watched it, you should do it right now.",8
The Shawshank Redemption is incredibly long but this movie never gets old.,10
This movie is one of my favorites about redemption and friendship. A must see for all.,10
Wonderful cast. Impecable acting by morgan freeman c.Right from the begining movie picks its pace.There's no moment without thrill while watching this masterpiece.,10
"How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption was likely going to be good. Nothing outstanding to timestamp on the history of film, but by 1995 it had suddenly grown a cult following and understandably so. It took a few years to become to cinematic phenomenon it is but in 1994 it was still recognised by the Academy with a best picture nomination, but it could not contend with big players such as the likes of Pulp Fiction and eventual winner Forrest Gump. Whether or not it should have won that year's Oscar award is still highly debated due to the quality of film from that year, but by no doubt it has aged the best, even better than Tarantino's acclaimed and admired Pulp Fiction.

Does the Shawshank Redemption have great cinematography? Yes. But is it monumental to film like Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon or Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai? No. It's not specifically outstanding. Is it an artsy and classy film with technical detail to inadvertently sway the audience's emotions? To an extent yes, but not quite as artsy or technical as Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather trilogy or Martin Scorcese's Raging Bull. It is simply an excellent film with excellent technique made into a timeless film because it is so rewarding to the viewer. For starters, the plot is excellent. It is often a very underrated factor of a film but your plot is so important to a viewer. It is a tale of a man wrongfully convicted of murder who uses his wit, integrity, patience and most of all hope to persevere. It instills a reason to watch the film, to watch the protagonist struggle under such odds. Like said before, the camera work is excellent with them utilising the shot variation to convey the emotion of the scene. And next I would like to mention the sub plot. One often failed thing in films. They try too hard to build the sub charachter and in the end it does nothing in the long run. The main sub plot of an old man who owns a library in the prison is such a great contributor not only to the story but to the circumstances and environment. Not to forget the excellent acting and narration by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. It has absolutely fantastic antagonists as well.

As well as this, it acts quite like a David Fincher film in that it rewards you more whenever you watch it a second time around. There are little details and smart lines of dialogue which you can pick up on. It is just so fantastic how every minute of that film gets tied in a neat little bow. Everything comes full circle. Perhaps nothing so unexpected would turn out to be so excellent. I only take issue with the ending which with the beginning is the most important part of the film. I hear one of the Castle Rock producers insisted on a complete conclusion with the ending, but if that little knot had just stayed untied then that film would have been even better. In spite of this, it is with no doubt in the top 10 (and likely top 5 films ever made). Afterall, it hasn't been IMDB's top film for so long for nothing. Pure excellence.",8
Absolutely brilliant! Well done! Good work! Amazing!,10
"Nice and lovely ,i,m see this very time, very lovley, i,m not tell about this story",10
Worth watching. Watched it like 10 times till now still get goosebumps every time.,10
Not good bye bye movie hello goodness cuz this is a game,9
"This movie is the genre that I love so much, I watched it since I was in high school, it was a good movie and it was extremely thrilling to the very end. I wish there will be many films like this giving the audience a feeling that they will hardly know in this normal life.",10
Great film and a brilliant score by Thomas Newman! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have excellent chemistry...,10
"This movie was so entertaining to watch and I actually loved it so much. I watched it with my family and its breathtaking. The acting, sets are so incredible and cool. Obviously it has such a high-rating because its so entertaining!",10
This one is absolutely amazing and hits different than rest of prison movies. Its an unique journey through good and bad. Right and wrong. Invidious and justice. I enjoyed it a lot and Recommend it.,10
"This film is perfect in every sense of the word, every scene immaculately shot, every story told with emotion. This film is an art treasure. The story of redemption is a necessity for anyone going through adversity. A story so genuine and gripping, words cannot describe the emotion you feel from this film. I love you",10
"If you can't watch a movie which doesn't contain any explosions, wild car chases or corrupt cops, then this movie probably isn't for you. However, if you enjoy a good story with great acting and execution, then you really should look into ""The Shawshank Redemption"".

So why is the movie so good? The movie as a whole is simply breath-taking. In addition to the exceptional story, everything is ""just right"". I've seen loads of movies with good stories, but most of them seem to fail in other aspects (poor acting, poor camera-work and such) making the movie as a whole not live up to its potential. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is NOT one of them. It actually manages to pull it off, resulting in what I deem to be one of the best movies ever made.

I give it a 10/10, without any hesitation.",8
"Great movie. This movie is awesome, it gets you captivated from start to finish.",10
"For those of you who rated this movie a 1/10: Shame on You! There is no way, even if you don't personally love the movie, that you can deny it's one of the best movies ever made. Just like there are some people who may not have personally loved the Godfather, Citizen Kane, Shindler's List, etc. and, therefore, gave those movies a 1/10. That's a bunch of crap. I personally didn't love the Godfather, but thats because it's not exactly my type of movie. That doesn't mean I bashed it and gave it a 1/10. I could see right away all the great qualities the movie had. So for those of you who voted 1/10 for shaw-shank, ask yourselves if it was really that bad, or was it just that you personally didn't enjoy it as much as everybody else...My guess is you would respond truthfully to the latter, so at least give it a 7, 8, or 9, not a 1. Thats all I have to say about that.

Now about the movie...The writing, the acting, the the music, the theme, etc. It's all as close to perfect as you will find in a movie. I don't want to write any spoilers, so let me just say that each and every scene of this movie is well crafted. It's the type of movie that keeps you on your toes from beginning to end. This is one of the only movies that I can remember that was so good, I forgot I was watching a movie. You can connect with the characters on such a personal level. Everything they do feels real. Nothing is under or overblown. TIm Robbins was the perfect cast for Andy Dufrane. Robbins' melodramatic personality lends itself perfectly to his character (Andy). As a viewer, you can never really tell what Andy is doing or thinking. Unlike most heroes, Andy doesn't make his objective clear to the audience. Morgan Freeman is the perfect actor for the character Red. Listening to him narrate the story is a real treat. I don't want to say anymore for those of you who haven't watched the movie yet. If you are one of those people, I wouldn't skip out on this movie. You will be doing yourself a disservice by missing this film. One of the best.",10
The best movie ever . after all this years it still in the throne,9
Awesome Movie. One of the best movie i have ever seen. Really it deserve 1st position.,10
Best movie in the world... Most touching and satisfied climax that i ever seen... This movie filled my heart..,10
"I love films and this might just be my favorite. A simple movie about hope. A feel good movie, that will make you cheer for the human spirit! Great cast of characters. Wonderful acting by Robbins and Freeman, a true must see movie...",10

"Great Movie to watch. Direction by Frank Darabont is amazing, everyone should watch this movie, Actors played an amazing job, Every Charavter was well writter and played, Tim Robbins gave one of the best performances ever. Just loved everything about this movie. Even the cinematography was great.

every Detailing of the film is well done.",10
last summer I saw ( for the 6 time) this film again I don't know why but I was terribly shock by this film and today it always make me feel bizarre . I don't know how they do this film but it was really good. I think that this film is one of my favorite with the sixth sense and terminator 2 (sorry but it remind me my teenage) .,9
It is one of the most beautiful and overwhelming films I've ever watched Totally worth watching.,9
Was very gud and i really enjoyed it even though i didnt even watched it and dont know anthang bout at and i want to watch it but i is broke,9
This is one the best movie that i have ever watched,10
"My mother watched and I watched, too. All my family said: The Shawshank Redemption is fantastic

We watch popular old movies every year with my family, and the movie in the list

If you have not watched this movie, then I should not talk to you",8
No me canso de verla para mi opinión es la mejor película de todos los tiempos 🙏🏻,7
"If this script (if it could be said to be a script) had not been from Tarantino, it would have never reached theaters (and perhaps not even on cable television movies).

Long, boring and pointless.",10
"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.",1
"Quite deserving of such acclaim, the acting is superb, the storyline captivating, and the cinematography quite beautiful.

It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.",10
"Shawshank Redemption is the best movie i have seen ever. The story, screenplay, everything about this film make u fall in love with it. Just brilliant.",10
I've seen this moving a thousand times and still watch it every time it comes on. Love this movie!,10
"Why did I not watch this movie sooner?! What a perfect masterpiece! This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. The setting, environment, casting, acting or in other words, everything was an absolute phenomenal.

I loved the relationship of the characters and the story arc. The level it set on the emotions of the people was the reason this is one of the best films ever made. To the people who worked on this film, thank you for this wonderful film. It's a crying shame that our industry does not make such movies anymore.",9
"Super movie, I strongly recommend you to watch it.",9
I am just learning how to use IMDB and I am just giving a blanket response out of curiosity but that doesn't make this movie any less epic!,8
The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption touched my soul. I really liked the strategical thinking behind this movie. Remarkable direction and acting.,9
"I have to give this film a 10. It is easily right up there with Dolores Claiborne, Rudy, and Contact. Like Dolores Claiborne, this film is a departure for the usual story inspired by a Stephen King composition. The movie is quite faithful to the King novella which I also highly recommend.

The acting alone is worth the price of admission. Tim Robbins terrificly underplays his part. The whole cast contribute to make this more than just a movie; if it hits you like I think it will, you will be forever marked by it.

Sadly neither this film nor Pulp Fiction won the Best Picture Oscar in 1994. Incredulously, Forrest Gump won this honor. There is no reasonable explanation for this fiasco.

Finally, should you decide to see it, rent it or see it on pay cable. Like most of the movies above, Ted Turner seems to have cornered the market on showing them. If you do see it on TNT, there will be a lot of missing, crucial scenes and the commercials kind of ruin it; at least for me it does.",7
This is one of my favorite movies. a real good watch. i reccomend it for everyone.,10
Has everything required to be a successful movie! Great casting of the characters also pave the way to a fantastic film.,9
"Shawshank Redemption is indeed the best movie ever seen by me. The way the cast and directors have worked for it, really give me chills every time i watch it!",10
"Gojira likes Andy Dufresne's perseverance, persistence and patience.",10
This is clearly one of the greatest Stephen King movies actually performed to the writing masters stories. Well done.,10
"There are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. I can happily say that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has stuck to me since I finished watching it for the first time, and instantly rocketed up my Top 10 Films list.

Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in ""Shawshank"", at least not to me. The hefty run time doesn't put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again.

""Shawshank"" is one of those films that I would love to experience for the first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and lows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else.

In my opinion, ""Forrest Gump"" was not as deserving of the Best Picture Oscar as this. The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come.",9
"All time classic and best movie considering the production, acting, costumes, and screenplay",10
"This film is one of my all time favorites films, a true timeless classic, I remember the first time i wanted to watch it i though gosh over two hours for a film but it was worth it. The acting and story line are top notch. I wont write any spoilers i feel this is a film everyone should watch.

The story does show that redemption is indeed possible, rehabilitation is possible but also old habits die hard (no pun intended).

The screenplay from Stephen King and Frank Darabont is amazing the dialogue in every scene is engaging. I love a story that can show how simple human bonds can be formed regardless of race, age etc.",10
This is hands down one of my all time favourite movies. Full of twists and turns and intellectual sense of humour. Thoroughly enjoyed it,10
It's a very difficult movie to beat on imdb. It has a great and deep message. An impressive story... I hope a movie like this will come again but it is very difficult.,7
"Great movie, go and watch... I loved it...the cast and script all are good",10
"Old-school cinema, great down to the smallest detail, a story already made into a seventh art classic, an unbeatable directorial debut, and an ideal cast in a round film.",10
"This is the greatest film ever made ..... bar none! It has everything you could ever want in a film and more! The story is quite different to the short story by Stephen King but thats not necessarily a bad thing as the Green Mile followed the book closely and wasn't nearly as good as this! It says if you can to think of a film to compare it to but its in a genre all of its own. Other good prison films I could suggest are ""Against the Wall"" and ""Killer: A Journal of Murder"". Both of these are good but lack the depth of characters portrayed in Shawshank. For a good prison televisual drama then ""Oz"" has to be the best thing to come out of America after the Simpsons, it has the characters and plots to match Shawshank but generally without the feel good factor thrown in.",10
"This is one movie that everyone need to watch. Take out some time, find a good place, sit with your friends and family, grab a large bucket of popcorn and do not forget cold drinks. Start watching the movie. :p",9
Its the best movie of all ages. its perfectly show us to have hope even when there is non.,6
"I love this inspirational movie. Excellent!

Morgan Freeman is spell bounding in his performance as are all of the actors.

I enjoyed this movie because it's very moving. Timothy Robbins was so good in it.",10
"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want....",10
You don't die without watching this No matter how smart you are this movie will always be one step ahead of you. It depicts how the friendships should be. The movie will not disappoint you at all.,9
"This movie absolutely blew my mind! I was not expecting this at all. I love movies that leave me in awe by the time it is over. If you are into prison type movies or even if you are not, this is the film for you!",9
I love act for mr morgen and he's friends omg best movie ever.,10
Best one ever we can see it over and over again and always cry at the end,10
"From the start to the end its wont give the feeling of a movie. its just will take you in the screen.

If one decided something and working hard on the process ,he will get success one day may be over a long time.

the life you play over a long time is your comfort zone even its miserable. but when you move from that to a healthy condition of life that will be out of your comfort because you're not used to .some people do move on , some can't.

The prison is our life's hard condition and problems. and digging the wall and other steps are symbols of fighting with the problems.

The movie is a must watch film.",9
"This is a Great Movie that Never tries to be Great. It's just a Smooth, Entertaining, and Effective Personal Prison Drama with some Social Messaging and Character Explorations. The Usual Prison Sledgehammer Approach gives way to a Rock Hammer. Small and Light, but it gets the Job Done.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption surely is one of the best movies that every movie lover should watch once in lifetime. The best thing about the movie is that you will have all the entertainment without special effects. I usually do not watch prison or war movies but this movie has inspired me to watch more movies similar to this.

I can also count this movie as an inspirational movie. Whenever you find stressed or seems that everything is going against you or you do not have the strength to handle the fears or troubles of your life, you must watch this movie. This will help you understand that people can hold the hand of hope and strength even in the strangest or bitterest situations.

I was not aware about this movie when my friend has told me that he really like this movie and I should also watch it. It was not sure that if I like the movie until I have watched it.",10
The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography.,8
A beautiful film that leaves you feeling content at the end,10
OMG.. This movie is a masterpiece. I just loved it.. Won't give any spoilers to those who haven't seen it yet.,10
Frank Darabont direction is on its peak. It's the story of stephen king and a true story. You are gonna love this movie and each and everything related to this movie indeed,10
I love this movie. I watch it at least 4 times a year.,10
One of the best movie i have watches loved it. The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie i have every watches thanks to all the team for giving such entertainment to us. we are waiting for next part of this movie. thanks,10
"The best movie I've ever watched. Everything is fine there, from the actors' play to the plot and the film message. I'm ready to recommend this film to anyone who asks if it makes sense to watch it, but what can I say, its rating speaks for me.",10
Absolutely horrible movie don't watch :( I bought this to my son and we watched it it was absolutely horrible I am giving a dislike,8
"Great film. Ambitious, incredibly well written and fantastic acting. Very authentic and touching story, where you as a viewer are taken directly behind the bars in the prison.",10
When I first watched Shawshank I thought a typical prison movie but it was much more than that. This movie got into my soul it's like the film spoke to me and not many films speak to me on this level. I really would like everyone to see this film at least once in there lifetime. You will not regret it best Stephen King adaptation ever I will always watch this movie when it comes on tv I just can't get enough of it that's why it is my all time favorite movie I give it a 10/10 for that all performances are worth watching.,10
I saw this movie couple of times. Each time it gives me so much hope and courage to go further. Just bravo!,10
I loved this movie I watch it every time it comes on!,9
"One of the best movies I have ever seen, well acted, directed, everything was perfect. . the movie is about a escape from jail. but it was totally different from other movies like ""the great escape"" ""escape from Alcartaz"" . the shaw shank redemption is a different movie in a sense that, its not only about a escape. its classic, emotionally inspiring,its about a hope(""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free"". .then The twist that makes you worth watching it all along and leaves you with tremendous wonder. It's a good thing though, even for those of you who is too dumb to watch character driven drama and prefer mindless action movies. Tim Robbins and Morgen freeman were great. fine performances without the use of a lot of violence or graphic violence to get attention.",10
One of those movies that everyone needs to see at least once.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will blow your mind, make you fall in love with it. Brilliant actor performance, awesome script writing. The most beautiful movie of all time.

The unexpected storyline made me very happy when watching this film, it feels like if I had a time machine, I would love to see this film in theaters, even though I read the news that this film was not released in theaters and was only released on dvd format.

I really like morgan freeman's performance, i think he is one of the best actor of the 20th century, actor with the right character, he always animates his character well, and i really appreciate that.",10
"Nice movie and keep it up..

I have never seen such an amazing film since i saw Shawshank Redemption.",10
An iconic film and screenplay that brings to life the trials and tribulations of a man whom falsely enters the US prison system. It's truly enjoyable to relate with the characters emotions and travel on this realistic journey through external circumstances. I highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this film to see this classic piece of Americana.,9
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic gem that transcends the boundaries of time and genre. Frank Darabont's 1994 adaptation of Stephen King's novella delivers an emotionally charged, thought-provoking narrative that has cemented its place as one of the greatest films in cinematic history.

The heart of the film lies in the friendship between Andy Dufresne, played brilliantly by Tim Robbins, and Ellis ""Red"" Redding, portrayed by the incomparable Morgan Freeman. Their on-screen chemistry is a true cinematic marvel, delivering performances that are nothing short of remarkable. Tim Robbins' portrayal of a man wrongfully convicted and his unwavering hope is a testament to the human spirit's resilience. Morgan Freeman's narration and portrayal of Red, the seasoned inmate, provide a soulful anchor to the story.

The plot is meticulously crafted, keeping the audience engaged throughout the film's 142-minute runtime. It weaves elements of hope, friendship, and the indomitable human spirit into a complex tale of redemption within the bleak confines of Shawshank State Penitentiary. The screenplay beautifully balances moments of despair and triumph, making the viewer's emotional journey a truly cathartic experience.

Cinematographer Roger Deakins captures the prison's stark, foreboding atmosphere and the transformative beauty of freedom with striking visuals. The film's timeless cinematography, along with Thomas Newman's evocative score, complements the storytelling in a way that deepens the emotional impact of every scene.

The supporting cast, featuring actors such as Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Clancy Brown, contributes to the film's rich tapestry of characters, each with their own compelling stories and arcs.

What sets ""The Shawshank Redemption"" apart is its universal message of hope and redemption. It reminds us that even in the darkest of circumstances, the human spirit can endure and find its way back to the light. The film's profound themes resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds.

Ultimately, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of cinema. It's a timeless story of friendship, hope, and the resilience of the human spirit. A true classic, it will continue to inspire and touch the hearts of generations to come. If you haven't experienced this cinematic triumph, don't miss the opportunity to watch a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",10
"It's as simple as that and 2 things stopped it from achieving that honour. The enormous nostalgia eventual winner Forest Gump had most wrapped up in and more importantly the unappealing first impression this movie gave when it was released.

The worst assumption one could make of The Shawshank Redemption is to think it's a depressing prison movie. Admittedly that's exactly what I thought when I first saw the preview scene of Morgan Freeman telling Tim Robbins that ""hope is a dangerous thing.."" I remember thinking OK my life really isn't like being in prison, but do I wanna watch something that's gonna bring the mood down a notch. Big mistake at the time, but just like the title, I had my own redemption of sorts when I caught it on video.

The performances of Robbins & Freeman should have won the best & supporting actor oscars and the work of the rest of the cast makes you wish they had an ensemble category. To late for ""shoulds"" I know, but in years to come if this title doesn't cement itself into the all time top 5 I'll be surprised.

Knowing millions have now seen it would make it easy to reveal more of the movie to give it a better description for those who haven't, but that's exactly what would ruin it for them. As cliched as it sounds, the whole phrase of ""just give it a chance and watch it"" has probably never been more appropriate for a movie like this one.",10
This movie is one of the best of all time for me. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I seen this masterpiece like 5 times and probably gonna watch again soon.,10
Shawshank the first movie that inspired to watch Hollywood movie except superhero series . hole movie you will not know where is the movie going . but when the scene comes you will feel better as like as pooping after a long time being in pressure .,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover.",10
"When I first sat down to this movie as a thirteen year old with a fascination for cinema, I did not expect to be whisked away into a film that still stands in my top ten to this day. A true masterpiece in every regard.",9
Great film. Wanted more action. Great plot. Great cast. Great A/V.,10
"Sorry, but I don't get it. Below average movie. Why it gets all this praise is beyond me. Shouldn't even be in the top 100, let alone No. 1. Its not even the best Stephen King movie, I mean when you look at the likes of The Shining, Misery etc. There is no comparison. Don't believe the hype (you'll be disappointed)",7
This movie will keep you watching! You won't want to leave the room for even a minute.,10
19yrs and 500yards that's what the power of hope is.,10

"This movie is my favorite. I seen a few years ago. The film received positive reviews from critics and was nominated for many awards, despite the fact that the box office gross met the budget.

"A film I can watch over and over again - great storyline, beautifully filmed, top-notch acting - I always feel good about myself after watching it - there's hope for us all, even the most downtrodden nonentities in this miserable world of ours! cinematic brilliance. Tim Robbins plays the lead character's role with such a classy understatement, & Morgan Freeman delivers a powerful and nuanced performance that always lifts my soul as well as the great performance by all the supporting actors. I will be the first person to admit to having a slight eclectic taste in films, but this still ranks as one of my favourite films of all time. This truly is my definition of cinematic brilliance - pity we don't get more films like this anymore.",10
"Something more beautiful -----The Shawshank Redemption

This movie tells us a tale that takes place during the 1940's in a horror prison called Shawshank. The story is about a young banker named Andy Dufresne; a man was wrongly accused of murdering his wife though he was innocent. After Andy Dufresne was sentenced to Shawshank Prison, he must deal with those people despise and bully him, those brutal guards without any justice, and a corrupt warden who cannot do anything. Then he discovers the horror of prison. Prisoners in this prison seem to have been forgotten the hope and freedom which belonged to them. They forget how to live a free life and cannot think of some beautiful things outside the prison. Gradually, they get use to the prison life and give up the seeking of freedom. They become unconcerned and lose their faith, which is the most awful thing to one¡¯s life. In this prison he meets a man who has been sentenced to there for some time already, Red, who then strikes up the friendship with him. He is the narrator and is known as the guy who is able to get almost any type stuff from the prison. He helps Andy finding a rock hammer which helps Andy escape from the prison at last. What make me admire Andy most is his unremitting perseverance. He spends almost 20 years to dig a channel and escape outside from the prison just by a small rock hammer! One should not lose or give up his faith and dream, or just like a man without his soul. He cannot do nothing only knows he is surviving in the world like an animal. Courage is the motivations which stimulate you go ahead the success field in the dream. Andy writes a letter to Red after he gets outside. In the letter, such sentences like this:

Remember, Red. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things,

and no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds

you, and finds you well. Your friend. Andy. I like the letter very much. It touches my heart deeply and makes me think much. I think about the life in the future, think about the meaning of my life. How should I do and which road I choose will make the life more meaningful? It is decided by yourself!

"There's not much to be said about Shawshank that hasn't already been said. Morgan Freeman's acting here is some of his best, Frank Darabount's direction is near-perfect, and the story is a classic. But what really stands out is the classic feel of the movie, the sheer simplicity and perfect pacing that makes this film reminiscent of far older classics. It's not enriched in innovation but it's a worthy return to form, a perfectly-crafted masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has garnered.",8
This film amazing for motivation and in my life influential,9
"Want to know why this movie is the best ever made? Is simple really, because it talks about all of us. It tells the story of how we all feel in times of desperate. The basic needs of all of us, for this movie its freedom, revenge, and love(friendship)! That is our emotional NEED in today world. Therefor I think that if anyone wants to make a another great movie they should remember to make the film out of a simple element, Human Emotional Needs, and let the lack of those needs drive the film, until those needs are achieved at the end of the film. That's what will make a great film. However it is our creativity that would make the film comes alive and stick in the viewers mind forever.",10
"One of the greatest and true pieces of cinematic masterpiece. Shawshank will forever be in at least the top 25 movies to watch of all times. I can watch it over and over again and never tire from it.

The Movie allows you to ponder the troubles in your own life, that no matter what problems, no matter what is bringing you down; as long as your mind stays strong then the skies the limit.

Shawshank is not only a prison movie, but a movie about humanity and acceptance. Tim Robbins character is so smooth with out a care in the world, its if like prison life doesn't even phase him, but it just showed that no matter how he felt and how hard of a time this character suffered, he was in time befriended and accepted for who he is and how strong willed he proved to be.",10
"Hope is a good thing

The movie named the shawshank redemption told us a story about a banker called Andy Dufresne who is convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife. His life is changed.

The life in the shawshank redemption is a life-long nightmare. Severe and unbearable rule and punishment, what¡¯s more, the same routine life; boring and dull make them isolated from the outside world. The high wall can isolate the freedom of the physical body, but it can't isolate the freedom of the mind. Andy Dufresne have strong will in his mind that hope is a good thing .his inmate friend red told him good is dangerous thing ,especially in

the jail. There can be miracles when you believe though hope is frail. It¡¯s hard to kill. Who knows what miracle you can achieve! Andy found many meaningful and beneficial things to do .during the imprisoned life time he is digging a channel led to the outside bit by bit. A continues dripping water can wear through a stone. we all know that life is too short for waiting, but I also know that life is long enough for doing something that really turns me on and energize me .......hope is a good thing always it is .after watched the movie, I thought a lot about my life . Do I still have hope in my future life? I always complained about my present life .always resented my boring life .never think about how to change it. I am awake now .clearly awake! I don¡¯t want to become the frog which is boiled by the warm water step by step!

If you have hope you can overcome anything no matter what our situation.

"Our lives are full of ups and downs. From the seemingly petty and minuscule problems of our youth, to the deep-seated frustrations and serious life-changing situations of our adulthood. Through most of those issues, we are left with mainly two choices: wallow in the despair and hopelessness of the situation, or embrace the hope that things can change AND work towards that change. That's the core philosophy that I always get from this film, my favorite of all-time.

Starting in the late 1940s, The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy (Tim Robbins), a banker that is wrongly imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover. After being sent to the brutal Shawshank Prison, he befriends long-time convict Red (Morgan Freeman), as the two develop a friendship that would alter the course of both of their lives.

To those that have known me, my love for this film is probably widely known. Ever since I first saw it back in the mid-1990s, while going through some ""petty"" romantic frustrations of my teens, the film instilled in me that philosophy I mentioned in the opening paragraph: I could wallow in my frustrations and get stuck where I was, or I could assure myself that things can change, and move towards that. ""Get busy living or get busy dying"".

As juvenile and inconsequential as my issues at that moment might've been, I've pretty much made that my philosophy of life against any life problems and situations I've faced since. From health issues to economical problems, from career frustrations to more adult relationship situations, I always try to embrace the hope that things can, and will change, and get busy working for that.

After rewatching the film for the gazillion time a couple of days ago on my birthday, 25+ years after the first time, I can say it remains as magical, profound, and meaningful to me. Not only is it masterfully directed and shot, but the honest and endearing performances from Robbins and Freeman are always moving, always affecting; a testimony of how, yes, a friendship, but also your own actions and attitude towards life can help keep you alive, hopeful, and free.",10
One emotionally touching movie. No wonder it is on the top of the top250 in IMDb.,10
I was feeling very grateful by watching this movie.,10
I watch this movie several time and it's still amaze me.,10

"Like picasso,chaplin and the beatles the sycophantic veneration of this ""icon"" is a complete mystery.Its a decent film - but it certainly isn't a great one,its no better than escape from alcatraz,brubaker,i escaped from a chain gang, but that doesn't matter to the cinematic lemmings vainly looking for prestige and kudos about a run of the mill film glorified by movie luvvies.Even trailer park trash have got in on the act"" my favorik filum iz da shawshank regemshun"". -thats when i knew the farcical proportions of overrated glorification this film had reached.Its supposed to be about ""liberation,emancipation....blah blah you know the usual poncey guff thats trotted out for meaningless symbolism and metaphor.Luvvies love a movie voice over commentary,aka scorcese - why ,who knows?.But the film does have a potent manipulative power - which was also used by another weakish film -the shining, and that is the pathos laden empowering music score- this is what so brilliantly fools gullible viewers sadly.In the final analysis how can a film be great when it contains a ridiculous scene of a prisoner(robbins) immobilising a whole prison full of violent incarcerated males by playing opera- and yet he doesn't even receive a rightly deserved mother of all beatings",10

Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them",9
Mustch fun mutch love.and bring more seasons out plz.,10
"Best movie I have ever seen as single part movie, although it is considered as an old movie filming and editing was acceptable.",9
"Andy, he is my the most admire character, and he is the man who own the spirit, that I searching for a long time. I think that as long as I has the spirit like his, I was success a half, so I will going on to this aim.

The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man being charged with the murder of his wife and her lover and is consequently sent to Shawshank prison on two life sentences. Year after year, Andy faces more and more adversity, victimized by ruthless prison guards and malicious inmates, but combining his mentality, courage, determination and spirit, as well as his close friendship with veteran inmate Red (Morgan Freeman), Andy's journey becomes an utterly unforgettable one.

The reason Shawshank is so good is because it's so incredibly moving and powerful. Up until the very last minute, you're drawn tightly towards the screen witnessing, step by step, Andy's growth in Shawshank prison. The acting is sublime, the dialogue is intelligent, the story is inspirational, the cinematography is breathtaking and every other little detail is done to maximum superiority.

Above all, is my comment about this movie, and I hope have a communicate with you on the movie.",8
"A monumental celebration of resiliency, The Shawshank Redemption explores eternal themes of hope and friendship through the story of a banker convicted of murder adjusting to a brutal new life behind bars.

It's 1947 in New England, and young bank vice president Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to the sprawling Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve two consecutive life sentences. The prison is run by warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), who believes in discipline and the Bible, and ruthless chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). Andy initially sticks to himself and has to fend off the unwanted advances of a group of pathologically violent rapists. He then befriends resourceful long-timer Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a leader among the prisoners and legendary for being able to secure any item from outside the prison walls - for a standard 20 percent mark-up.

Andy finally establishes his reputation by helping Hadley save on his taxes. Norton then appoints Andy as his personal banker and chief tax-evader. Over the years, Andy uses his elevated position within the prison community to dramatically enhance the prison library, and helps several convicts to finish their high school education. But a shocking confession from a prisoner in another facility sets Andy on a collision course with Norton. 19 years into his sentence, Andy's determination to hang onto hope faces its ultimate challenge.

A generally faithful adaptation of a Stephen King novella, The Shawshank Redemption is a dazzling achievement. Director and screenwriter Frank Darabont constructs a deeply moving essay on the adaptability of the human spirit, and the conflict between hope and despair when the future appears uniformly grim.",10
"i've seen the top 50 films in the IMDb top 250 category and a number of times I've felt that a movie wasn't worth its ranking. the shawshank redemption fits this bill in not being placed number one. and this coming from a die-hard god father fan must surely mean something. the storyline, the cinematography and the acting are all masterpieces in their own right. the story of a wronged person accepting his fate and then changing it is remarkable, for everyone relates to it, though maybe not to the extent portrayed here. kudos to stephen king and frank darabont and the actors for a great movie. its a real pity that it won no Oscars. this is one movie i would have hated to miss. truly exceptional.",10
Awesome movie and what a beautiful screenplay. must watch,9
"It is a very touching, deep movie. It shows the brutality and torture the life makes us go through. What life also gives us is hope.",10

This film is the best movie I ever watched. Hope I could forget it and rewatch it from scratch.,5

"A gripping and moving film based on Stephen King's novel, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' about the friendship between two inmates in Shawshank Prison, Andy (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman). A truly great film with both Robbins and Freeman embracing their roles to bring the viewers inside the gates to experience the brutality of sadistic prison guards, rampant corruption, and dreams of the outside.",10
"Its my favorite of all times, highly recomend it to everyone!",10

"I've always loved this film. Today I got to see the top 250 of IMDB for the first time and couldn't believe my eyes. There it is, numero duo, number two! But it is there for a reason. This movie is a work of art (that's rare nowadays). The prison environment, the relaxing sound of Morgan Freeman as a story teller and the atmosphere are a combination that makes you almost part of the film. I just can't find the right words to describe the film, but it is still a piece of art. For those who still haven't seen this film: Enjoy.",10

However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc.,",10
I love to watch this movie. it gives me motivtaion for never give up.,10
"Every man, woman, and child has the word ""success"" etched into their mind. Oftentimes, failure seems like a despicable and frowned upon idea; we tend to push ourselves past the breaking point simply to ensure that we succeed. Ball's idea of ""knowing what you can not do"" is a significant topic that pesters society today. Limits exist to provide control and a sense of stability in our lives. If people are not aware of what they ""can"" and ""can not do,"" they will push their boundaries until chaos erupts. Although limits may hinder progress, Lucille Ball's belief regarding the importance of knowing ""our limitations"" is crucial to society's development because limits allow for overall prosperity and order.",10
"There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent",9
It was one of the most amazing movies that I ever saw!,10
"Great Actors, great Direction and a fascinating story from beginning till the End. After all these years it's still one of the best Movies ever. Morgan Freeman shows once again, that he is a great actor. Tim Robbins becomes better and better till the great ending of the Movie. It shows, that Stephen King is not just a master of horror. He is also a master of storytelling. Thomas Newman was a great choice for the soundtrack. The movie is so good, that even the parody versions of it are great. For example in Drawn Together and the Simpsons. It's a timeless classic. Every movie fan should have watched it. So sit back and enjoy.",9
This film is very good and pleases me. it would be great to add some of the best actors and actresses in the country.,10
"Why The Shawshank redemption is a good movie to watch even if you're new to these films industries? it's because all the plot have a twist, so the viewer can't expect how the ending will be. I suggest you to watch this film before you gone to heaven. Nice Job! -Susetio Cahyadi",6
"One of the best films I've ever seen...it got all the elements from life. Hope, struggle, suffer, friendship, joy and all the other things all performed by the best actors around.

"Andi Dufresne (Tim Robbins) was sentenced to three life sentences for killing his wife and girlfriend and sentenced to life in prison. However, only Andi knows that he did not commit this crime.

"Somebody said that life as fence, those who are inside want to leave, while those who are outside wanted to go inside. There are also have another kind of man who satisfied with the about circumstance and easily become victim. Lu Xun, a very famous writer in china said: If you don¡¯t uprising in silent, you will die in it.

The Shawshank Redemption, Andy is a man who satisfied with the about circumstance: Through his strong abstention, he didn¡¯t shoot his wife when he found her betray; Through his strong will, the first night in jail, which full of fear and dark, he had a narrow escape from death; Through his sturdy resistance, he didn¡¯t yield to force and join in the dark organization. At the same time, he also was a man didn¡¯t satisfied with the about circumstance: his brave exchange a box of beer for his friends and gain a strong shield; his never give up made the jail library had the first class equipment; his was severely punished bring the wonderful music to the jail where nearly forgot by angel.

Everything passed in silent. Dark hair turned to white; adult became old man. The kindly librarian killed himself after he was set free. It seems just the other prisoner¡¯s fate .Silent, everyone hesitate to how to continue their lives. Andy gave the insensible and perplexed prisoners a reason of relive. Sun , sands, sea ¡­¡­ overthrow the violence of political power.

I remember there is a kind of bird , she use her hold life time to find out a kind of thorn tree . when, thorn of tree pierce the bird of heart , she will sing the most wonderful music in her life until died.

How beautiful life is when in freedom.",10
"Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever.

"The best movie I have ever seen. This movie reminds me of the story of a bird inside the cage waiting for the day of freedom to hover into the sky. The case is the same for Andy. This movie made me imagine a situation where there seems no hope in life at all. But as Andy said, ""There's always hope.""

I get to find the truth that even a single person can lead to change. From this movie, you can know about yourself and attain a successful journey.

Whenever we confront adversities, let's lead like a game-changer while enjoying our personal growth. I recommend you to watch this movie as I loved it.",10

"A very, very good film. Yet it only gets a nine. The ending of Andy sanding the boat is too cheesy. Red setting off into the distance on the bus was enough. Definitely one to watch multiple times though. Now go down to your nearest retailer and buy a copy now !!! Now go down to your nearest retailer and buy a copy now !!! Now go down to your nearest retailer and buy a copy now !!! Trust me, you'll be glad you did. I am so glad film four is free now in the UK. Another film i'm looking forward to is Trainspotting.

"A common film about the life of people behind bars of the prison. Nothing important. Usual stupidity! I wonder why so many people have described it as a ""movie of the century""? Just because the score was ""9/10""? Oh, come on, do not have illusions. A monotonous film with a poor script. Okay, it's got a plot twist that almost leaves you loud before the end. Nothing more!",10
This movie is one of the best ever made in hollywood.,10

Morgan Freeman takes the first place and also Tim Robbins shows a great performance. There are many memorable scenes in the film. This film can change your point of view for the life, it has that power. It teaches not to give up. Thanks to Stephen King (short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption) and Frank Darabont (screenplay) and all others who made that fantastic film. I can not call it just a film. It should be the number one on the list and it will be! As it says 'Fear can hold you prisoner hope can set you free'.",10

number 1 on IMDb's list for a reason... a must see for any and everyone The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so powerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.

No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?",10
This movie has taught me a lot ABOUT LIFE AND I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE. I rate it 10/10. The acting is on point and so is the story line.,10
"Sat down one evening and happened to catch this about 5 min. into it, and was stuck on the couch for 2 hours. Have no doubts about picking this up for a quiet, entertaining, enjoyable evening. Great story, well acted and engrossing. Robbins and Freeman are excellent, like Hoffman and Mcqween in Papillion. If you don't find tears in welling in your eyes and a smile on your face seek resuscitation., ENJOY!!!",5
"as a die-hard king fan for 30 years, i have routinely been disappointed in the movies based on his books. this is quite possibly the best movie adaptation i've seen. overall, i was impressed with the performances of all the characters.

maybe the only thing i wasn't clear about or didn't understand was the fact that some of the guards had accents that didn't seem to be louisianian. the accents seemed to be more boston-ish. however, it has been a while since i've read the books so maybe i'm forgetting a detail or two.

ultimately, i recommend this movie to any stephen king fan, and to anyone in general! it's excellent!!",10
Maybe people who are not of your stature are senior to you.conceit prevents progress.you should first overcome your conceit.be steadfast in your efforts.,10
"Nice movie. Will recommend.

There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.",10
"What an amazing film! There are not enough words to describe the pure artistry in this. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely my favorite film.

The acting, and the narration truly pulls you in. Watch it NOW!",10
Movie is soo good and screenplay is simply superb. Must watch for movie buffs.,10
Nice one movie awesome watch it I recomand itAwesome movie a very nice movie guys,9
"This movie is just a blessing, one of the best movies i have ever watched and to be very honest it doesn't even matter how many times you watch this movie the more you watch the more you fall in love with this movie.Every character , every scene from this movie is just a beautiful sculptor carved out of a marvelous piece of marble. This movie is a must watch for every generation, the dialogues are something from which you will learn something not just love but it will carve your mind and soul for a long while. I don't really write reviews and things but this movie was supposed to be written about. Kudos to the crew, cast and the creators of the movie...",5
"When you start writing your movie scenario you first think about the beginning the actions the emotional the deep feeling the show how you attract the viewer how you took him to the end, in that movie i didn't even know how he wrote it or think about it to start or end, best movie ever",10
"If I was asked about my favorite film, I would think for a rather long time about the answer. There are many well-rounded films that I enjoy, so choosing the best of them would be a complicated task. However, if I was asked about the films that I would name among the best, I would almost immediately recall ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a film proving that when a person has will power, a dream, and persistence, nothing is impossible.",1
"Yes I like it but ,I cant say. that is a perfectly perfect movie",10
"Best Movie,The Direction Adaptation and Film Portrays the story is Auwsome... However the arrival of anothe inamte is going to vastly change things for all there was no fanfare out for the release of the Film back in 94",10
"Nice ending. Plus, the way that the narrative is portrayed, makes you go with the plot and you're always attached to the caracters. It feels episodic and yet you're orientated to follow the goals of the main characters. The villian, it's all what an antagonist should be when you learn about stoytelling because it shows you that regular humans come as good and moral people,but they act against their own principles. Therfore, there is a lot of moments where you can rest and the plot doesn't get stuck and you're able to enjoy contemplative bits where the caracters are discoverying purpose when there's no hope for the in prision.",10
Awesome movie. Loved loved loved it. I love everybody in the movie. This is my all time favorite movie. I loved morgan freeman in it. It really showed how life can be when u get locked up. Then it also shows what happens to the men who have been locked up for a long time. They don't know anything or anybody else besides the people and guards they was locked up with. I liked how they put a different spin and view on it.They let people see how things use to go on in the jail from a very very very long time ago and how men didn't want to leave because jail was all they knew. they didn't know much about the outside because it had changed so much. If i was them i don't think i would want to leave either. i loved the movie. i bought it and i watch it everyday.,10
"I watch it at least once a week. Changed the way I live my life. Better than medicine when your feeling down or depressed. Still searching for some people out there who haven't seen it. I love watching it with someone who has never seen it, just to see their reaction. It's like I'm watching the film for the first time. The best movie ever, ""that's god damn right""!",10
There is nothing to say. All the words unsufficent at this point. Just SEE this art..,10
"This movie was great, no other can compare with it. Just read the book, its one of the finest ever too.

The story completely take me to another world and i just totally forgot all the real-life things for hours.",10

This movie always intrigues me every time i see it. The plot is set incredibly and engages the viewer till the very end. I will recommend everyone to watch this movies.,8
From along time I watched this movie and I never forget anything about it so when I want to watch it again it took me 10 years to see it and it is fantastic as always.,10
"You know how there is this one movie that you never get sick of watching. No matter how many times you see it, if it's on you watch it again. That is this movie !",10

"Usually a movie shall grabs the viewer's attention within first 15 minutes, which a common strategy for a standard type of a movie. I did not see that type of attraction in first 15 minutes of this movie, but at the end it was one of the remarkable movie. Hence, it is kind of a out of box movie.",9

I saw this movie 7 years ago. I have been in deep love since then. But throughout these years I met some friends and saw many many movies to say the least but never ever any topped this one except ""The Green Mile"". I gave ""Shawshank"" to many people I know and they still call me just to say ""Thank You"". My friend's brother was once in hospital due to terrible accident and he said he wanted to watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before his death and I said how can a person love something so much and he got well and watched it and said-""I am not going to die this soon"". I remember clearly my father once noticed me watching and I said you should watch it (but he never watches any movie ever!!). He refused so much but I insisted and he watched it and cried and requested to buy him one another copy. He said ""I'll give you money, just I want all this director's films."" I didn't know much about IMDb. I thought just critic review it. As soon as I found out, I just wanted to write to it.

Also other Frank's movies like The Majestic (Best movie to watch with Family) and The Mist (Heart-breaking end to watch ever.)

Believe it this movie has a huge audience but they are not on IMDb. I've many many movies but nothing..not even Star Wars, Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, Casablanca, LOTR, Citizen Kane were and will be able to dethrone this KING (Stephen..I mean Frank Darabont).

This will always be #1 (Along with ""The Green Mile"") to me until I die. Both are my #1.

""I won't ever choose one over other.ever..ever..EVER.""",9
A great film with a great story line and screen play. Highly recommended to watch this film as it gives you an understanding of a good cinema. Morgan freeman.,10
"Very well directed , great plot . liked it . overall very complex",10
"Old but nice ever I'll keep it short: If you are a fan of the True Crime genre you will probably like this series. It follows ""the usual patterns"" and executes the documentation and narrative quite well. It is nothing ""special"" but definitely one of the better shows of this kind I have seen in a while.",10
NIce movie we love this it is good movie best ever i seen this is soo good,10
Perfect Movie. I would love to watching it overtime and time.,10
Very good really enjoyed it.i thought the actors in the film were really good.i story behind it was also brilliant.morgan Freeman is a great Actor with cool hair.,10
Awesome I really like it really good but why we gotta write a lon review for,10
Still an awesome movie! It is a classic and one that is still very good to watch. I think everyone should continue to love and support classics such as The Shawshank Redemtion.,10
I can tell you this film has everything in it. No film can match this ever in any era,9
"I don't think there's anything new one can say about this movie that hasn't already been said over the years. 14 years ago a friend gave me the dvd to watch it, and he said it was his favourite movie. I started watching this movie with skepticism, because when people overhype the movies for me, i usually end up not liking them that much, because of the high expectations. But boy, oh boy, was this an exception to that rule. I finished this movie feeling completely inspired and amazed what i had just seen. I was trying to understand why i had loved it so much when the story is not a complicated one, actually it's a very simple one. Then i realized it was because it is a movie that can apply to most people in life, especially at those times we need a little more hope.

A lot of scenes stand out, from the horror Andy endures, like tha harassment from the ""sisters"", the times spent in ""the hole"" or the 20 years he spends in jail for a crime he didn't commit, to the beautiful and inspiring scenes, like the roof top part, the singin Italian lady, Andy's letter in the end. Or even the heartbreaking scene with Brooks. I don't want to say much more, because i don't want to spoil it to newcomers of this masterpiece.

Just be prepared to be moved, inspired, and watch a perfect example of what cinema should strive for: an amazing script, amazing acting, a beautiful story that will leave you thinking and if you are lucky enough, it will inspire you like it has inspired me and countless others. Absolutely one of the best movies of all time and my personal favourite.

Get busy living or get busy dying. 10/10",10
"I didn't watch this movie till 2020 can you blv that, i spent my life watching movies and i never did watch this one till toda, and it made me write my first review here and i can't even know what i soudl say just perfect amazing. outstanding acting, music, story, and every little thing about it.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a metaphor, an analogy about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. The Redemption in the title holds true to its meaning from every aspect of the story. When Warden Norton realizes Andy has escaped with the documents he looks at the framed words from the Bible - ""His judegement cometh and that Right Soon...."". Soon after this is shown again when Red reads out Andy's letter under the white oak tree. Andy writes those beautiful words - ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" The film wonderfully depicts the lead roles Andy and Red's daily sustenance and minor triumphs. Its truly inspiring. Most splendid is Thomas Newman's somber score which at its best moments alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes. When Red says - ""I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope."" It gives an eternal peace to the audience to watch the end of their journey and the forthcoming reunion of the two buddies. The movie although being a prison story with a sense of frustration on the lives of the prisoners it is really about the unlikely friendship between Andy and Red. How each one of them nurtures the other and serves as a touchstone for keeping their sanity intact. This movie is timeless for me.",10
"Amazing film through and through. The twist in the film, no one saw coming. 5 stars. This was probably Morgan Freemans breakthrough role that catapulted him into Hollywood.",8
"All good thanks, highly recommended, I would watch this again",10
Awesome story of human morale and sacrifice. Highly recommend to watch it!,10
"first off, excellent movie. great characters. second, when Andy breaks the sewer pipe during the escape, crap shoots out. That is possible only if the pipe was plugged up and under pressure. Even then the pipe would still be full of crap up to the hole after that loss of pressure. yet the pipe was fully empty when Andy looked in. Also, the only pipe that can drain directly into the river is a rain/storm drain pipe. Crap will come from only the sewer pipe which means that Andy would had have ended up in a septic tank which is what most likely be used in such a rural area. third, how the hell did Andy fit into warden's clothes/shoes???? how did Andy cut out the bible pages so perfectly to fit the rock hammer? how come nobody got visitors? Who is Allen Greene in whose memory this movie of?",10
Is a best movie sdkjrjdjjjdjjjjjjjjjdseooeowoorelldlldlskkeijij ie,10
"This movie really moved me when I first saw it on TV. A great plotline, actors with perfect acting skills and the impressive reflection of social problems and humanity. The most amazing point is that I can barely find an actress throughout the play. Except for Andy's wife, no women have ever appeared on focus. Despite this, Shawshank Redemption has become one of the world top movies, while nowadays too many directors just want beautiful actresses to attracting the audience.",10
This is really amazing one love to read this.. and this is best for everyone must read this,10
How dramatic and beautiful movie is that?! I am very happy right now in these covid19 days,1

Player subtle and got a masterpiece. This movie even now competes with the high-budget hollywood movies like avengers. The story doesn't just change slowly but transforms completely at the end. What a masterpiece it is and yes not one of my favorite but on top of my favorite list.,10
"I have to say, that was a movie which made me love to see it again, when i watched it, after every time!",9
Whole movie was pretty amazing. the storyline successfully tie-ups viewers,10
A movie that I can watch over and over and over again. Superb!,9
"Very good film, would recommend. It's a violent film so not for the heart lighted. From start to middle to finish it gets you edging out of your seat. The characters are believable. The special affects are brilliant. If you scared of violence or don't like blood and guts don't watch this film. I loved the different scenes. My son loved this film well he would he is a teenager and loves all the fighting scenes that where in this film. On the other hand my daughter disliked the film because she like films that are not violent like this film is. I would recommend this film to people who like fast pace films. As I mentioned before the special affects are brilliant and it must have cost a fortune to make this film.",10
"I've watched this movie some months ago and it was one of the best so far. The actors do their job great and the production it's simple but amazing too!

I love the simpleness of this movie and I was moved by how friendship and hope were shown.

I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie and I think that it is suitable for every age and person.",9

"The scene where Andy's cell is being searched, attentive viewers will start to suspect the significance of Andy's Bible and the Rita Hayworth poster. Pay particular attention to the shot where Andy is facing the camera with a look of pure panic on his face, while prominently framed on the left-hand side of the screen is the Hayworth poster. Then there's this line from Norton, which gets a direct callback later on: Warden Norton: (handing Andy his Bible back) Salvation lies within.",10
"I am absolutely of the mind that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is very close to a perfect movie. Yes, it is a long film, but it is involved and rich.

Characters are sketched out beautifully. You see them, warts and all.

Descriptions of places and people are, um, robust and vivacious.",10
"This movie encapsulates the essence of our necessity to change and evolve our criminal justice system. We always have an opportunity for change, and small stories of triumph like this one bring hope to those who never thought it possible to have. The acting was a dedicated one, where those involved showed everything they had to display the most outcast people in society. It has encouraged me to always help the most disenfranchised, and to help as many people in society as I possibly can.",8
The best movie I've ever seen ! I don't want to say any words about this film. Just a perfect 10 !,10
Movie is quite old but the flow of story is just amazing.,10
"I would describe this movie as as close you can get to movie perfection. There are points where you will laugh. Points where you will cringe. Points will you will feel so angry and points where you will feel so sad. But, ultimately, you will come to realize that with faith and hope, anything is possible. (Warning content and quote given ahead) The language is a bit extreme, but it is set in a prison, and as the character Red says in the movie, ""Prison ain't a fairy tale world"" (Paraphrase). This isn't a family movie, but every movie fan needs to see this at least once. This is my favorite movie.",10
"I love every single part about this movie. I watched it a thousand times and studied it. Love the mood the colors of it. The story is unique, this is one of the rarest movies that makes you pay close attention on dialogs and structure of the story.",10
Very Good Drama. and good work on this industry.. i like it nice,9
"This movie is hands down one of the best movies ever made. It has good acting, good writing and good everything really... Now i am not going to give any spoilers, because that would ruin your exprience if you are going to watch it for the first time which i doubt. What this movie has most of all is iconic moments and heart breaking moments. For the rest i won't say anything but i highly recommend this movie!",10
Wow...incredible film...I appreciate it. I'm going to tell my friends to watch this film.,10
Actors And acting is Extraordinary in this movie Worthable film to watch everyone.,10
"One of the most inspiring films I have ever watched. It's truly astonishing especially the ending that, of course, can be guessed, but still comes along in a very nice way. That said, I don't think I would give it the first place in the IMDB ranking. There are so many films that are even better shot and more inspiring than this but, definitely, this one deserves to be in the top 10.",10
"I remember watching this for the first time in my Highschool Film as Literature class in the year 2010. At that moment, it became one of my all-time favorite movies, nearing the top. I had no clue who Frank Darabont was, but it's amazing how much you can respect someone without even meeting the individual. The direction, the acting, the set, EVERYTHING was impeccable! The symbolism in just the smallest things pushed the story even further. I'd encourage everyone to read biographies about this film to know and understand the true intensity of Mr. Darabont's ""Shawshank Redemption"". It's not a surprise to me that many have given this a 10 out of 10 rating as I have. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Then read the biographies.",10

"I saw this film about 4 or 5 years ago after hearing nothing but praise about it. After reading the blurb I couldn't wait to get the tape in. Since then I have seen the film numerous times and am still not bored. It truly is a classic in every essence of the word. In my opinion possibly the best film of all time, maybe 2nd only to Forrest Gump. They truly don't make film's like this any more.",10
Anyone who watches Hollywood movies and like suspense should watch it.,10

"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles. I see this movie 3 time and it is very good",10
"The best Hollywood movie I've ever seen. The screenplay, the background score, the story line is epic and original. I just wish there is a Shawshank redemption 2. Morgan freeman's acting is one of the best as a supporting actor. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.",10
"A film about HOPE, FRIENDSHIP, and LIFE.

"""I am so glad I came across the film about your amazing school on PBS. I actually became a little choked up...Hope stirred in my heart. Yes, this is the way to true learning! We need to allow children to explore, use all their senses, problem solve, understand community, and so much more! We must help create creative minds",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece imbued with humanity and art. So much beautiful things in 148 minutes. It conveys the simples but extremely great ideas of humanity. It is immortal song about friendship and hope.

The Shawshank Redemption strongly touched in hearts of viewers cause of the deep humanity in the content, the sophistication of portraying the character image and the attractive way of leading the story. The layers of meaning not only stop at the surface stories, they are also cleverly hidden into the iconic images and contrasting symmetrical details spread throughout the film.

The acting of two actors Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) inspires viewers with great emotion and inspiration. You will impress the resolute coldness on Andy's eyebrows, Red's gentle smile and deep-seated eyes. Not only the two of them, but all the other characters leave impressive traces in people's hearts.

Even when the movie go to the end, the sounds and values left to the viewer are not faded, it still be keep deep inside the mind, in the heart of each person.

I am very regret cause I consider to late such a great and legendary work.",8
This is a great movie with an excellent story. The acting is excellent.,10

This movie definetely deserves it's spot. I never get bored watching this movie over and over.,10

"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a 1994 American drama film directed by Frank Darabont and based on the novella by Stephen King. The film follows the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker who is wrongfully convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary.

The film stars Tim Robbins as Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, a longtime inmate and Dufresne's friend. The cast also includes Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Clancy Brown in supporting roles.

The film is known for its powerful performances, moving storyline, and iconic scenes.

The film explores themes of hope, redemption, and the human spirit, as Dufresne and Redding navigate the harsh realities of prison life and find ways to survive and even thrive within the confines of their situation.

One of the film's most memorable scenes is the moment when Dufresne escapes from Shawshank using a tunnel he had been digging for years. The scene is shot with a sense of awe and wonder, as Dufresne emerges from the tunnel and into the pouring rain, symbolizing his newfound freedom.

"When the warden opens Andy's Bible from the safe, he opens it to the bookmark in Exodus to find the cutout where Andy hid his rock hammer. Exodus is the second book in the Bible, so there'd only be a few pages (Genesis) above the cutout. But when the warden drops the Bible to the floor, it falls open to the bookmarked page. Now about half the pages are each side of the bookmark, with one half cut out and the other no",10

"When in trouble, people's reactions are actually only two, ""Andy said as he circled his hands, struck a match, and lit a cigarette. Assuming there is a room full of rare paintings and antiques, Red? Assuming the homeowner hears of a hurricane coming? He may have two reactions: the first type always holds the most optimistic expectation that the hurricane may turn around, and God won't let the damn hurricane destroy Rembrandt and Degas' paintings; if the hurricane does come, anyway, these things are also insured. The other type of person believes that the hurricane will definitely come, and he Your house will definitely suffer. Even if the weather bureau says the hurricane has turned, this guy still assumes that the hurricane will turn around and destroy his house. Therefore, he made the worst plan because he knew that as long as he was prepared for the worst outcome in advance, he could always hold optimistic expectations.",10
"BEST STORY LINE TILL DATE, this is better than the new movies out here",10
"I was turned on to this movie by my late uncle Ed. He is forever captured in my memories every time I see this wonderful movie or hear the soundtrack. The Harmonica and orchestra is so intense, it just lives with me forever. Our favorite track was Zihuataneho, it is where we will meet in heaven. Thomas Newmann has created so many beautiful soundtracks, but this is my all time favorite. The greatest ending of any movie, it just lets us know that in the end, justice will be served... When I think of this movie my favorite line is get busy living or get busy dying. Tim Robbins and the warden, am I being obtuse.",10
"I have recently re-watched this movie and it never fails to blow me away with some of the hard hitting scenes of sorrow or the uplifting light hearted moments!

This is a fantastic movie and deserves the praise and rating it gets but it does not go in my top spot for there are other movies I value higher as an opinion and simply because of tastes in movies.

As far the movie goes it really gets your prison vibes going really makes you feel like your serving time with other inmates just trying to get by find the right crowd that will always have your back if you need it.

If i was a bigger fan of prison esc movies I would give this a 10. The reason I rate this movie so high despite the fact is because the movie is so well constructed and how well some of the scenes are dramatised is so hard hitting you really feel for these people and realise there will be many people in these situations that will still feel a certain injustice that is happening to them.",10
This film is a masterpiece and also a very inspirational.,10
I have never seen such a movie in my entire life. This movie has made me realise the importance of patience and cosistency. Must watch movie for all especially for youth who want to do something big in there life. This movie will definitely motivate you.,10
Best movie ive seen. Love morgan freeman and the other guy,10
"I won't be saying much about what's in the film, instead I'd tell you all about what I felt after I watched this masterpiece. The moment the movie ended I got inspired by how the characters of the film were being constructed and made to work. The protagonist's role made me intend to immigrate to place, where I could live without the dirt which I'm surrounded by now!

Congo to the film's team and just can't imagine that it has been nearly 26 years since this has hit the theatres. I highly recommend everyone to watch this magnificent piece of art.",10

"I've never written a review on a film before. This film is outstanding and is the best cinematography I've ever laid eyes on. All of the charaters in this film are excellent and adapted in what I describe as the best adapted stephan king film. The actors truly depict greatness and realism. The soundtrack to this film is also a classic and makes me wonder in awe of the masterpiece that was made and still holds up today as the best film I've ever seen. Hope is used as the greatest asset, with it bringing good things and maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.",10
"Excellent! Speaking from my experience as a teacher and preparing numerous students for the exam, I can say that most review tasks look pretty much the same. The structure is very very similar and once you know what to look for, you can use it to your advantage by saving a lot of time and going into the test ready and calm.",10
So nice! i have watch this movie. I think this is good!,9
"This movie is one of my all time favourites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Dartboard was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.",5
One of the best movies in the history.Specially each and every part of the movie is something special and meaning something.,10

"Nice i love it! Its an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemptio. There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history.",10
I love this movie so much! I want to watch it one more time!,10
This is one of the few movies that is both entertaining and moving! This will truly leave you breathless by the end! I highly recommend watching this!,10
This film was by far the best back in 1994! All the way the best!,1
This film is really very cool and awesome,10
Everyone should watch this movie in their lifetime.,10
"this movie took my breath away. it is a thought provoking, beautifully acted, gorgeously filmed, uplifting film that never disappoints. Tim Robins and Morgan both give award winning performances and it is very odd when one realizes the lack of awards this movie received. Do not let the lack of awards dissuade you though as Shawshank Redemption is quite possibly the best movie i have ever seen, i just cant emphasize how good this movie is. Please do yourself a favor and see this film right now if you haven't already.

If there was one good deed that could get you into heaven then watching this movie would be it.",10
This is the best movie ever.. no need to write a review,10
"This is the Best Movie I have Ever Seen. I can't think of anyone not seeing this movie. If there was such a way that; I would erase my memory and watch this movie over and over again, I would definitely do it. The story is very smooth and you can not get your eyes off he screen. Even if you don't like such prison movies you should give this one a try. Because this one isn't just a prison movie, it tells and shows the real life events. Real people and real reactions to real events either they are good or bad. This is life itself. Sour, sweet and everything in between. Prepare to cry and laugh. Such a great intellect. I see similarities with the series OZ (1997-2003) and this movie. You may also want to check OZ as well. These two are perfect stories to experience. Also the actors and actresses played their roles perfectly. This is a masterpiece. You won't regret it.",10
World Best movie ever 😍 Everything is was perfect I'm really glad to Saw this movie,8
"Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro",10
"One of the best movie i have ever seen, it is great movie all the time. Cinema student must watch this film , or i would say must learn from this , the story line is very fine and good",10
"Well for the Priosn escape this would look normal but there is a bit twist , the way he helps all the Cops and others is a part of mind blowing plan. one of the best Critics movies to watch if uyou are a Prison movie lover.",9
This is the top movie in my life you can whatch it a 1000 without break,10
"Great inspiring story!

Definitely takes you back to the era of true filmography, a movie I wouldn't mind revisiting multiple times.",10
"The film is a masterpiece in storytelling and character development. The performances by both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, with Robbins portraying the quiet and intelligent Andy, and Freeman playing the wise and experienced Red.

The film tackles themes of hope, redemption, and the power of friendship. The scenes in which Andy works to improve the prison library and educate his fellow inmates are particularly moving, highlighting the transformative power of education and self-improvement.

Overall, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic masterpiece that has earned its place as one of the greatest films of all time. Its compelling story, outstanding performances, and powerful themes make it a must-watch for any movie lover.",10
'The Shawshank Redemption' is the beautiful feel good movie i've ever seen.Jail break is the main plot and the life and the friendship of two prisoners.It is also visualising the immoral practices of the police and the warden aginst the prisoners. Awesome performance of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Frank Darabont's Direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography was Amazing. A Must Watch and the Greatest Movie of all time.,10
Its a great movie would watch again. It has some great story beats and holds a great place in my heart. Watch it with friends and family to get the best experience.,6
I've rewatched this many times on my cable and I have yet to find a single flaw. Hits me every time I watch it.,10
"Musgt watch this movie,it is an adaption of the stephen king novella rita hyworth and shawshank redemtion.",10
"They are both absolutely phenomenal here, finding relatable character beats within a script that would have stymied other performers, conveying a growing anxiety without resorting to cheap tricks to highlight it.",9
It is the bestest movie i ever see in my life. Great story.,10
"Is a very interesting movie with a suggesting trama, I recommend it to everyone",8
"This movie is well deserving of #2 of all time, if not it should be #1. This movie has #1 most votes cast for any movie, and as anyone should know, the more people that vote, the more accurate the rating should be. As of now May 24th 2007, there is 255,456 people who have rated this movie. 150,715 rate it 10/10.

This movie is not over-rated and remains my favorite movie of all time. Why? I can pop this movie in at ANY time and thoroughly enjoy it. There is no other movie that does this for me. And thus will most likely remain my favorite movie of all time.

If you have not seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for. BUY IT NOW. You will certainly love it.",10
"It's a wonderful movie with a touching storyline. It grips you hard at moments and lets your mind wonder freely at the same time. You would be surprised by the lessons it teaches you and believe me, they'll change your perspective of a lot of things in life",10
"Yesterday, i watched the movie for the umpteenth time. I just can't get enough of this masterpiece. Whenever i have the time for a movie, and i don't know a new one to watch, it is a certainty i will end up watching this movie.

The Shawshank Redemption has such a wonderful story to tell you as a watcher, which can't be told any warmer than by Morgan Freeman. The movie gives the viewer such a beautiful rollercoaster of emotions, from anger to fear and from sadness to happiness. Just the ending scene gives me goosebumps every single time i watch this movie, and that is exactly why i see it multiple times a year.

Overall, i think it is a must seen for every living creature on this planet. And it can be seen on Netflix, so what is your excuse to not watch it?",10
The Shawshank Redemption has great performances and one of the best movie i ever watched..,6
10 stars for the cap Morgan and the shower scene was also amazing,9
I didn't lose my interest till the end. I was really inspired.,10
"Best motivational movie for life ! Every scene , every minute , all! i really motivated after watch this movie. Thanks.",10
I love it a lot!!! You really MUST WATCH!! The actors and all the drama that happen during the movie is amazing and envolving really need to see.,3
The movie is perfection from the cinematography to the performances. It's the type of movie that challenges you in unexpected ways. Iy a character driven story that breaks a person down because of outside forces. You can't help but root for the characters and emotionally invest in them. It's a 10/10 . I personally gave it a 9 because of one particular storyline I would have liked a better conclusion for and I felt the writing could have fleshed that one storyline out better but aside from that it's a masterpiece,10
I love this movie so much this movie is the best .i love the actor especially morgan freeman,10
"For years I kept hearing about this little movie called the Shawshank Redemption, I saw snippets satirized in shows like Family Guy. Finally I decided to sit down and watch it on Netflix a few weeks ago and I could not stop watching. I started watching the movie in the middle of the night and finished it as dawn was upon me. Intriguing from the very beginning, compelling to the end, truly a masterpiece of a movie. The acting is excellent on all front and it was nice to see some old familiar faces from the 90s that we don't get to see in films these days. I see now why this movie is now called a classic. Definitely a movie I would recommend.",9
It is boring and never really touched WASTE OF TIME,9
Greatest movie I have ever seen. Most exciting thriller as per me.,7
"One of my fa vs and i am only in my teens. here's my top five 1. 12 angry men 2. THe Shawshank Redemption 3. Rocky 1 4. Godfather pt. 1 5. Pulp Fiction

I was very impressed with these movies especially The shaw shank Redemption.

Morgan freeman was really good in this movie, usually i don't like Tim Robins in any of his movies but he was really good in this one too.

IMPRESSIVE!!! Also the movie Cool Hand Luke is pretty impressive.

THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ENTERTAINING AND STRONG WRITEN MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I INJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THIS FILM,10
"What a great movie, movie worth watching. 2 hours went away without knowing will watch it again.",10
"This movie is fantastically done with great quotes and great acting



Would recommend this to literally every single living human being.",10
This movie is great to watch with your friend.. try it guys,10
"This is good example of how to not to make a movie. It begins quite dry. The main character doesn't seem like he quite knows how to act as he is thrown into a poorly lit scene in what seems to be the director's garage revamped. He then goes to prison. NO SENSE WHATSOEVER! Obviously there is a huge paradigm between what the director though the film to be and the original writers.

We then see all of what we normally find in prison, with a very fatal exception. NO MINING! I am a personal favorite of mining in prison. I love to see people smash rocks and burn coal for fire. We mainly find dry dialog from what appears to be actors who have never left their parent's basement (no wonder the director still films at his home). I had to leave the room a few times so that I could get some fresh air while the movie attempted be filmed.

My advice is to buy this film only if you need a DVD or VHS tape for a scrap booking project. The reflective qualities are very nice and the packaging insert can also be used to store a home video. Be sure not to allow the label to be visible, as that may cause your friends to disown you forever.",10
"One of the best movies of all time. Saw this movie many years ago, so i can't remeber. Today it runs on free tv, and make my day.",10
"When I read the back of the DVD in the store I thought to myself several times. Why bother this is just another prison movie. But eventually I had no excuses left not to buy this DVD I heard great reviews about it. Yet I still settled myself down for another movie. After watching the movie for 30 minutes I was already starting to wonder why on earth I hadn't bought the DVD of this movie sooner. And the first thing I did when the movie ended. was playing it again. The fact of the matter is that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the few movies of the last decade or so that you can actually watch over and over again without getting that feeling of ""I already know how it's gonna end"".

This movie is a must see for everyone and deserves nothing less than a 10 out of 10...",10
"What a story, what a characters, what a movie. One of the best movies I have ever seen. Everyone should see this one. I have bought the dvd to add to my collection of favorite movies.",10
"Great, epic drama that is the kind of works that give you really hope and enjoyment i cant describe how amazing this is.",9
The way this guy struggle and-told about the true meaning of hope. is give us the motivation towards life.,9
This is the must watch movie.The action scenes are super crazy. I have seen with my family and friends 4 times atleast,10
"Epic drama , great hope , it is just perfect , i cant describe it with few words",10
"I really like this movie and watched 4 times. Waw. I rate it 9 out of 10. Highly recommended movie, i suggest watch it 1 time must",10
"Not only was this the first Stephen King novel I saw adapted to film, it was the first time I recall seeing a book I read done well as a movie. It restored my faith in the idea good movies can be made from good books.",10
"As the uptight banker, Robbins does some of his subtlest acting to date. As his hardened but resilient friend, Freeman is simply miraculous, giving the role so much depth, dignity, and good humor that you feel that you've known this man forever. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those rare films that ages better with time. People talk about this film more now than when it was released in 1994. The acting, writing, cinematography, direction, music, editing and everything else makes this as close to a perfect film as you can get.... Speaking of jail, ""Shawshank""-the-movie seems to last about half a life sentence. The story, chiefly about the 20-year friendship between Freeman and Robbins, becomes incarcerated in its own labyrinthine sentimentality.",10
"BESTEST MOVIE EVER, I can watch this movie thousand times, without getting bored.",10
No more words for this film. Spectarcular! All what to do is prepare some snack and enjoy the film.,9
"This movie proves to the cinema industry that ""if you have a strong story, there's nothing more needed"". There was not a single moment when I felt bored. Every shot , taken by the director was showing it's beauty. Followed by Strong acting, this was a very good experience for sure. I was wondering why this movie got so much positive reviews and when I watched it , I got my answer. Every character in this movie is unique. It's also a story of friendship . I am damn sure that you will get positive vibes in this movie. I have no words to express my experience . It is worth watching. Rated it 10.",9
"Great film! I've seen it several times, there's an enormous amount of subtlety if you really learn to watch. The casting is really crazy!",9
"Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today...",10
I love it. It was truly beautiful. This is just a test for my project. Yo.,10
"The title explains it all! I've watched this movie 7 times and with a movie of that length, that's quite a portion of my life. This is also the first movie review I have felt strongly enough about. All I would say to the doubters is simply to watch this masterpiece and decide for yourself. In the past I have been disappointed by some of the reviews here, however, not the case here though.",10
"One of the best masterpiece movie, I saw twice this movie and both time I enjoyed perfectly. this movie inspired me to allow never give up in any situation",9
This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories,10
"This movie can not come recommended highly enough, the fact that it is constantly near to, or at the top of the Internet Movie Database's top 250 poll, is surely testament to this.

This is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time. If you are reading these comments, and have not seen this life changing movie (for both the film's characters AND the viewer), i truly envy you.

It is one of the few movies that I would wish that I have never seen, purely so I could have the pleasure of seeing it again for the first time and re-living how i felt after the credits rolled. It really is that good.",10
Full enjoying watching movie .i willwatch new more part i wish realse some more part,10
"Good movies, with good plot and it's a wholesome story with a little dark side story too.",8
This movie all actor Acting are Amzing and Unbelevailable. Movie story line is a perfect. this movie is one of the my favourite movie,8
"A film that leaves a mark on the heart, despite its pros and cons. And I think that's the main thing.",10
"I just loved this movie. i was a bit confused before wathing this movie because this was old movie, but after watching this amaizing movie. I loved it",9
"The ending was mindblowing, one of the best movie that i have seen in my entire life, if you didnt watch it yet, you dint know what your missing, please go check",10
"I have seen this movie at least 25 times. This is because I have seen so many scenarios in my dream before watching this movie. When I first saw these movies, my impression was that this would be the case. So every time I saw this movie, I was thrilled. I will watch this movie many times in the future too",10
"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.",9
Best Movie Shawshank Redemption that i have ever seen. I love the concept of movie. Great Work. I really appriciate and Heads off.,10
Perfect adaptation from Stephen King's short story.,10
"The Shawshank redemption, we know for its highest rated film title on IMDb and what makes it is its storytelling, narration in my opinion alongwith the good filmmaking and actors. The timeline is very smoothly executed , few events speaks a lot about the character , storyline in minutes - that's quality of good Storytelling.",10
"Very interesting movie. I watched this film when I was seven years old. I liked the idea, the script is very well thought out. They showed life inside a harsh prison. I thought it was impossible to escape from there, but the main character eventually had thoughts to arrange an Escape and you will see how he lived in recent years. in general I liked it",10
"The movie Idea isn't unique, an escape from prison. However what makes it a unique film is the dialogue and the plot. We see in the movie the fight inside Andy and the desire to escape. The fact that the prison couldn't break his spirit for 20 years is what makes this movie worth watching. The unique friendship he built with red , the library he built inside the prison and his powerful responses to the prison guard that forced him to give him respect not as a prisoner, but as a person. These elements make the Shawshank Redemption a great movie.",10
Nice Movie i love this movie. Everyone Watch Tis Movie,9
"I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.

I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.",10
"I remember first watching this because of a joke made in a show when I was a kid and my father laughed out loud and I was confused why. Took a good 15 years to see the joke play out when I finally see the rain scene and had that moment of, ""Ooooooooooooooh, *snickers*."" This film really did hit some personal hearts things for me.",9
"Really enjoyed, would definitely watch it again. I woudl thoroughly recommend",10
There isnt review. there is just only this movie. Its way too difficult to express anything about this movie that would contain the whole meaning or the whole feeling that inspires you. Excellent,10
"This has got to be my favourite movie of all time. i watched it a few years ago for the first time on a rental copy and HAD to buy it! I've watched it many times since! the cast and crew are superb! I don't think i could imagine anyone else playing any part in this, they all did they're job brilliantly! Film is about a guy who gets wrongly accused of killing his wife in a revenge style attack and gets sent to prison for life. Through-out the time he spent there, he came across enemies, friends and people he could use as an advantage for his plans. In the end, the people that thought they knew Andy realised that they did'not know what he was capable of after all.

I recommend this film to anyone.

10/10",10
"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has an excellent script with extremely meaningful content. Although the movie has a quite long duration, you will not be bored, but instead, you will follow every detail in the movie. In short, this is a good movie that anyone should experience.",10
"I watch movie and i think this is redemption, best movie i have ever seen.",10
Great story and execution. Tim and Morgan made a great performance,8
Shawshank redemption is the best movie I had ever watched.If you are a true movie fan you should try this movie.,10
"The Best film ever made. A true masterpiece and an epic that will never be beaten. The acting is of the highest standard with some excellent and true quotes, such as ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying,"" and the story line is fantastic with the most amazing end to the film, that leaves you in astonishment. Morgan freeman plays his role to the highest standard and it is definitely his best film in his career. I am a huge film lover, but I have to say i have never seen a film that touched me quite as much as the Shawshank did! If you haven't seen this film, I promise you now, you are missing the best film of all time.",10
Loved the movie Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins made the movie worth watching both of them together are a power house. I'm glad they showed the jail experience and what they go through. This movie is a prime example of how things are different from the outside world. I wonder what the directors were thinking when they came up with the roof scene and when they put Tim and Morgan together for a movie. Once you watch this movie and you see the connection between the characters on who is hated and not hated. But wait until you see what Tim Robbins starts doing in his cell to past the time and how he escapes.,10
"Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.

If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.",5

A sad story, but also a wonderful story, the end is so powerful.

For those who have not seen this movie, do not wait. Even if you do not like prison movies, this is no ordinary prison movie, that's for sure!

I can highly recommend this movie.",10
"It is definitely on the list of every person with a certain knowledge of the movie world. This clearly shows that the given value is correct. It beautifully depicts the importance of life, time and the reward received at the end of patience.",8
It's an amazing movie with an amazing end. The actors were excellent especially Morgan Freeman. Regards...,10

This work is very beautiful and very good Because prison and action and drama,10
"The Shawshank Redemption was very interesting. The choice of characters were well fitted for the dramatic events of the movie using characters like Morgan Freeman who really plays strong roles that suits this movie and keeps the watcher interested. I find that this movie was well worth it as it has you watching til the ending which gives you a great momentum to an emotional dramatic ending. I would watch it, again.",8
"Simply brilliant, this is the film that made me falll in love with more artistic style films rather than action packed entertainment films.",10
"What a wonderful movie. A classic for sure!!! This movie got me so emotional, I bet everyone else as well. I am so impressed !!! No words can explain my feelings.",10
"The best movie ever made, hands down. Acting, direction, cinematography everything is just amazing. The performances of Robbins and Freeman, the score by Thomas Newman, and the cinematography by Roger Deakins. 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, and Best Cinematography.

The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie, actually its a masterpiece, started as a short novella by Stephen King.

Its a movie about time, patience and loyalty - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.",10
"No words are needed for the movie.. Great story, Best movie",10
"I love the characters, the story-line, and I like how this movie makes me feel hopeful. Hope is truly a good thing, the movie made me feel good about life. It is hard to put into details to describe how much of a masterpiece this movie is. It's a beautiful one. I love it.",8
"The Shawshank Redemption was released in a very good year for movies (1994) and although it could very well be argued that, at the time, it did not get the credit it deserved-- being overshadowed by movies like Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, it now may get more credit than it is due. Time and time again I have heard the phrase, ""They don't make them like this anymore,"" when The Shawshank Redemption is spoke of. However, it should be noted that Shawshank was not the first movie of its kind and owes much credit to its predecessors (taking elements and ideas from movies like Dead Man Walking, It's a Wonderful Life, etc.) Well paced and often times very moving, The Shawshank Redemption provides us with what is initially a very realistic situation: middle aged man Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is put on trial wrongfully (as far as we know) for murder. Found guilty, he is put in jail for a life sentence. As the movie progresses , in part from beautiful cinematography, and in part from lightly tugging at the audiences heart strings, we are able to sympathize with the inmates, and almost pity them. The concept of having a home and not knowing what to do when not in your comfort zone is something that the Shawshank Redemption uses to make a simple idea into a very good full length movie. However, it is ranked #2 on IMDb's top 250 (with a rating of 9.2 it is actually higher than The Godfather, thus should be ranked #1) and this, I believe at least, is an undeserving spot for The Shawshank Redemption. While it is very good, it is certainly not among the ranks of Citizen Kane, The Godfather and others on that level. Providing us with little or no historical or cultural relevance, the movie likely earns its ranking because people can identify with it, so they end up enjoying it, and end up giving it a 10 out of 10 because they enjoy it so much. Though it pains me to say it, just because a movie is highly enjoyable, it does not make it great by any means. Andy Dufresne acts as a metaphor for the rest of the human race, and shows, how sometimes, we are all wrongfully accused of something or other. However, the movie pertains only to itself, not taking on anything bigger-- so it stays a very good movie rather than an excellent one.",10
"Very good movie! I really like this movie! Thank you very much, I appreciate it!",9
"Amazing Story, Nice story written by frank darabont.",10
I love acting and that talk about freedom. Last escape scene and final story telling was one best scene giving me goosebumps while writing.,9
"I loved this movie. I would really hate to have been in these peoples shoes trying to live like this! Well portrayed and the actors were phenomenal!

I would like to see more movies like this one. It gives a good idea on what it's like to be in prison. The hell these prisoners went through is almost unbelievable. The actors did a great job portraying these roles. Very realistic!",10
"Honestly, I'm writing this on 2020, and still couldn't think about a better movie!!! A masterpiece.",6
"This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact.It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor - Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump.",10
"Imagine yourself in 1940's Maine, accused of a despicable crime of revenge on your wife and the man you recently found out was her lover, sent to a corrupted prison with a two-faced warden, where inmates are murdered for knowing information that would help an innocent man off the hook, or for crying on their first night of imprisonment. Where popularity with the guards gets you special privileges and crossing the warden while just trying to get the freedom you deserve gets you thrown into 'the hole' for a month. The only light of hope is the special friendship with a fellow inmate by the name of 'Red' and a rock-hammer hidden inside a Bible. ""Salvation lies within."" You can take my word for it, one thing that does lie within this movie is an incredible story of hope that will bring you to the point of tears at some points and enrage you at others. The acting is brilliant, the screenplay is superb. This drama places a new sense of hope in you that you would never have felt before. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is absolutely the movie of choice for anyone who appreciates excellency in film-making.",10
Good movie His actors are all great The best movie of all time,1
"It's by far the best movie i've seen in my life.

It contains all the elements you need to make a brilliant movie.

The chemistry between the actors is very beautiful, you feel like you know them and a friend of them.

I've seen it more than 10 times and welling to see it another 10 times.

A movie that catches your brith",10
"This was a GREAT movie. I was sitting with a feeling of happiness in my heart when the end text was coming. Definitely one of the best movies ever made. Just great.

"This is the best movie of all time and also my favourite one. I dont know how some people don't love this movie. The dialogue, cinematography, characters, the plot, everything about this movie is just perfect. The movie is a bit long for some people who don't usually watch movies but it is worth the wait until the end.",10
"Beautiful. Simply Beautiful. The essence of this movie captures u from the beginning to the end. I found myself emotionally attached to the characters in this movie. I don't believe anyone could ever surpass the true, ""essence"" of The Shawshank Redemption. The game that Morgan Freeman brings to the table can't be surpassed with his calm-demeanor narration and always stunning acting and capturing of the true character of ""Red"" in the movie. The friendship that Red and Andy make also will capture your heart. The mysterious Andy DuFresne is played beautifully by Tim Robbins. Other characters such as Warden Norton, Brooks Hatlen, Haywood, Byron Hadley, Tommy, and all the others, are also beautifully played by their actors. The story is clearly presented in old-fashioned way that will capture you, like i said, from the BEGINNING.",10
It is a great movie one should enjoy this as many as time he/she watches.,10
"This is one of the greatest films of the 20th Century,

Its a drama, Its a buddy picture, Its a prison movie, It's strange thinking of The Shawshank Redemption as a buddy picture though, especially when you consider that Andy's friend Red is a convicted and an admitted murderer and yet Red seems so gentle and trustworthy, also the other guys in Red's group such as Heywood seem nice as well and we dont even know what crimes those guys committed but when you watch this movie you dont even ask yourself what crimes they committed, you just assume it's murder.

watching the friendships development in this film is really moving, watching Red worrying about Andy the night and day after Andy Escapes just proves that they were more like brothers than friends,

The Shawshank Redemption is the only movie I have ever given 10/10 or a five star rating out of 5, I first watched this film when I was 14 years old and loved it then, im 20 now and I love it even more, this is my number 1 movie of all time.

Perfectly casted, directed and edited. An American Classic.",9
I heared this movie some days ago and I watched it more than three times. This movie has a good structure and stated clearly about everyones' motion. So all watchers can understand their actions.,10
"The first time I watched this movie, I thought to myself this could easily be one of my all time favorites. The second time I watched it I knew it was my all time favorite. This movie is about building relationships and getting a second chance. The acting is superb and gave me a whole new outlook on Morgan Freeman as an actor. His naration of the movie is excellent.",10
One of the greatest movies of all time. Great acting by morgan freeman and tim robbins.,10
I like this movie. It's a great movie indeed. Thanks,10
This movie is something else. I love it. Ive been wanting to watch something that good for soo long.,10
"There are two remarkable scenes in ""Pieces of a Woman,"" though the first - an almost 30-minute, largely unbroken opening shot of a home birth - seems set to divert critical attention from the second.

That scene, arriving about halfway through the movie, feels at least as radical and courageous as its precedent. In it, we see the central couple, Martha and Sean (Vanessa Kirby and Shia LaBeouf), try to have sex. Both are grieving the death of their child; but while Martha has turned inward, Sean is reaching out with visible aggression.",10
Nice movie. The best movie i have never seen.. But i am going to see now..Thank you,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the greatest movies of all time (in my opinion).

It filled with superb actors who maintain their high standards with fantastic performances.

The story line is utterly gripping and emotional.

You'll laugh, get angry and probably cry.

It's definitely one movie you'll never forget.

I have watched this movie hundreds of times already and would be happy to watch it a hundred more times.

Please, if you haven't watch it, watch it.",9
A movie with good messeges. I loved this movie a lot.,10
"The acting is incredible, the storyline keeps you hooked, the character development and emotions portrayed is perfect. I couldn't think of a more well rounded movie. It comes as no shock that this is imdb's highest rated feature film.",10
Hope is a good thing. And no good thing ever dies! This movie gives me hope and has taught me many lessons in life. Classic Movie. 10/10.,10
"A very moving great classic as there are no more, every time I have tears in my eyes the actors are exceptional and the story is so sad.",9
"I belive this was my childhood movie,, all the kids my age hated me cuz i dont like kids movie,, this movie gave me hope so that how long its take some day, one day every thing will change,, and it did.",9
And its so good that i cant even tell in words a must watch for everyone,10
"The best movie, i would say even the best film of the century.",10
Movie with unique story.....and very engaging screenplay,10
One of the best movie I have ever watched. Great life lessons contained in it. Good story lineup. Excellent work done by Red & Andy.,10
"A wonderfully scripted film complimented by the acting qualities of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

This is by far the best film I have ever seen and I would recommend that every movie fan see it.",10
Is the best of all time I love this movie because I'm like this movie it is the best,10
Watched this movie a thousand times! It's emotional and intense. I discovered that was based in a Stephen King book just few years ago. I think he is the best horror writer ever!!,8
"This movie was an apparent outcast at the theaters because I never even remember ever hearing about it. However, thanks to TNT and TBS this movie has become my favorite movie of all time!! It's moving and entertaining. It captures your attention and is intriguing enough to keep you focused. WOW, what an awe-inspiring masterpiece!",8
A solid 10 stars i have seen this film multiple times and enjoy each time I watch it. Very pleased,10
"The best movie i have ever seen , the scenario is so good and the cast is so modern and cool , the quality of the movie is so good for general prospective .",9
"Why i rated this movie 4stars? And why i love it so much?

If you really wanna know why you should watch it yourself.",9
All time favorite great movie with great characters,10
"This movie or story, I find it incredible, I write this review for this movie, because I really like this type of movies, more than in my life when I go to theaters, I seemed this movies, obviously different movies, from what I've always been a kid I've been attracted to this movie, I'm obsessed with this movies, more than ever I give it 10 stars for what I like, it really is movie I wake up, I hope and give another review, I really loved it a lot, I can't believe it, this if I was a movie, I really thought that I wouldn't look here, but I was wrong around here I looked at one just like the one I like, I'll always like.",10
This movie is truly moving. It draws you in and takes you along with the characters as they live their lives. The plot is extremely well developed. Every character has a lot of depth and the acting is top notch. The end gives me goose bumps every time that I watch it. I can never get enough of it. I have seen the movie at least 50 times and just writing about it makes me want to go watch it again. You will not be disappointed with The Shawshank Redemption.,8
Best movie of my whole life 😘😂 I can not control my emotions and very good movie.,10
"I first heard about The Shawshank Redemption in a conversation with a new friend. She said that it was one of her all time favourite films. The way she mentioned it....I don't know. I just had to borrow it!

I'm glad I borrowed that video. The way to do it is to get nice and comfy in a private place with some ice cream or something. Eliminate all distractions and you will be guaranteed to be drawn into the movie. Or to be simple enough.....watch it on your own. Other people can ruin it!

You are introduced to Andy Deufresne, a banker who is sent to prison for life after being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover. Before you know it, you witness the brutal things that happen in a 1940s prison. Beatings, murders, rape etc. But among all this brutality, he strikes up an extroardinary friendship with a fellow inmate called Red, a man who knows how to get things from the outside.

With his banking skills and his natural spirit, Andy gradually makes changes in that dark and miserable prison that touches all of his inmates in strange ways. To teach them all that nomatter how bad things get in life, there is always something inside you that others can't get to. Something that's personal and yours only. Hope.

Without question, I give this movie 11 out of 10 for great acting, clever and touching quotes, and for just being a beautiful story. Something that beats Titanic and Forrest Gump. One of the best dramas I have seen If Andy was to comment on this film, he would say, ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying.""",10
"If you have not seen this I highly recommend it, the first time I saw this it blew my mind.",10
"I've watched more than 5 or 6 times I guess and whenever it appears on any TV channel. The characters, everything about them, height, weight, age and even the race or education was set properly and perfect. I'd always get the imagination that I'm watching some footage taken on real time and during the daily life of the people live in a prison. They were so real and the theme was not a fictitious one and may anytime happen to any of us anywhere and we shall fing ourselves in a situation like in this film. The part about himself, the sentence he said about being a crook was wonderful and explained all what about thw film is. This is all what I can say about the film.",10
I watch it at least once per year and it gets better every time.,7
"Hope is everything. Deserves to be the best movie ever made.

Unlike many films of the Nineties, Shawshank has no ""high concept"" plot premise and is somewhat episodic compared with the tight, linear narratives of closer structured pictures. This sense of freedom in the storytelling allows the film to consistently throw up genuine surprises, as the viewer isn't constantly on guard for clues and plot points",10
This movie has so many lesson to teach us. This is an all time favorite to most of peoples.,10
One of the best films in the history of cinema. Required to view!,10
The shawshank redemption has become quite a classic for the most people these days. I watched it for the the fourth time today and am still able to say the it got my attention throughout the whole film.,9
Some scenes really caught my weak heart; especially the ending scene. I wont say it deserves a top spot but a really focused movie.,10
Life changing i just can say. My life is divided in 2 parts - one before watching Shashank redemption and one after watching this.,10
"I keep coming back to this movie as one of my favorites of all time. I especially find the casting executed to a high standard, and even though the basic story line is fairly straightforward, the multitude of layers and twists and turns reminds of the best works done in the Hollywood studio era back in the 40's.",10
"To be able to watch this after 20+ years after its release and still feel such emotion is something that few films can accomplish, from characters you will quickly find yourself attached with, to an amazing look at the prison system, and a storyline that will have anyone unable to look away.

This movie really does deserve its spot as IDMB's #1 and if you have the time do give it a watch.",10
"This movie gives me hope,Andy showed that sometimes actions are better than words, the man was silent and humble yet clever, this movie won't let you to blink, Andy reminds me Michael Scoffield In prison break, the professor in money heist but this time around it was a single person's escape plan over years ,it's a great movie .",10
"Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.",10
"I have never felt stronger about a movie than I did after watching this film. After about only an hour it felt like i had retained just as much information about the characters and message behind the movie as I would after a few seasons of a TV show... it was a very strange feeling. Every single scene, every line, every shot just felt right and it was fascinating to experience how flawless this movie really is.",2
This movie is so much more than you expect. There is a deep kind of faith in it which makes this movie great. Its sad that this movie did poor in the box office it deserves so much more. a must see. its always on tv so see it.,10
"I like the casting of the film. They are correct and spot on for choosing Andrew Garfield as Desmond Doss to portray his Heroism and bravery, because I think It is suitable for Andrew, as compared to his past roles playing Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man. When I first saw It, I thought It was so amazing and I was blown away.",10
"This movie is outstanding. It's a film that stays with you and enters your thoughts often. It's beautiful, well acted and well produced. It's a movie I have found myself going back to watch over and over (which I don't do often).

Sometimes when you watch a movie you don't remember much about it the future. The Shawshank Redemption truly is a film that you will talk about, dream about and remember. I've always believed the test of a good story (or film, book, etc) is not just how it makes you think but how it makes you feel in the moment and in the years to come. This is one I would recommend you add to your list and then rewatch months later. You won't regret it.",10
"This is one of the most moving, beautiful movies I've ever seen. You can feel the desperation and the hope. I encourage everyone to see it. The language can be a little graphic, but is probably appropriate for a movie such as this. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are surrounded by outstanding character actors who only enhance their performances. They add something to every scene. My favorite scene is that of ""Andy"" and ""Red"" discussing Mexico and the character of Andy sums up the whole movie with the line, ""Get busy living or get busy dying"". I've always loved this movie and watch it on TV whenever it's showing. I finally bought the 10 years anniversary DVD addition.",10
I like the movie concept as it looks like a common life but it relates to reality so i think you have done a nice work...,10
"The acting the filming the story everything in this movie is done perfectly, a masterpiece by all means; hundred percent deserves its spot on the list.",9
"Is Shawshank a good film? Yes. Is it the second greatest film of all time as this website suggests? Definitely not! I continually fail to see how people rank it so high. I don't even believe it was the best film of its given year. Pulp Fiction was a much more inventive film that changed the way films were made afterwards. Shawshank is a good film but I doubt it changed the cinematic landscape or it can be looked at as a work of an auteur. I am guessing the same people who regard it so high are the same people who have never seen a foreign film or consider black and white films hard to watch.

I hate to be so critical of a film that I enjoy. But at the same time, I feel I have to show my discontent with movie goers. I also don't consider the Lord of the Rings the 5th best film or Memento the 10th best film of all time. There were films made prior to 1990. People are free to have their opinions and I am allowed to have mine as well. My opinion is that the general public are the ones who encourage Hollywood to put out recycled formulas year after year.

***1/2 out of ****",10
I must say that I didn't expect it to be this good at the beginning but as the time passed I got more and more into the amazing story. One of the few movies that deserve a full 10.,10
"This movie may be one of the greatest ever created. It is a moving story which keeps you glued to the screen throughout, with probably the most satisfying endings in cinema history. It is certainly deserving of its current #1 place on IMDb's top 250 list!",10
Great movie with best action and i love this movie because its story is very good ~ Ali Sami Farooq,10
Best film I have ever seen. Good script good concept good color. Best direction. I am also a writer director I think it is the best film for learning direction script writing and light. Congratulations to whole team of The Shawshank Redemption.,8
"What can I say. its a very master pieace movie.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.",10
The best movie ever for me. The best movie ever for me. The best movie ever for me. The best movie ever for me. The best movie ever for me. The best movie ever for me.,10
I think i had seen this movie more than 5 times in last 1 year.. Its is my favourie movie..,8
"I don't regret watching this movie, I still don't. A truly emotional and meaningful movie.",9
"Besides the gripping and dramatic aspect of the story, I was impressed by the feeling that these kinds of events could also happen in real life. It is a story that is not written in a sloppy way, saying ""they will cry anyway"". This is expected from the story of Stephen King :)",10
"A drama about the life of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) after he is sent to Shawshank prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. There he befriends fellow prisoner 'Red' (Morgan Freeman) who narrates the film with several voice-overs. An ordinary man in such a situation would be crushed by despair but Red relates that Andy was no ordinary prisoner. Although prison is a kind of hell, even in a completely unforgiving and corrupt system with an evil warden and dangerous fellow inmates, he doesn't lose his spirit. Andy makes the best of the situation and can even claim small victories while serving time. Most important (for a Hollywood film) Andy doesn't lose hope. Red initially sees Andy's efforts as futility and leading to inevitable disappointment, but over time Red develops great admiration for Andy. The Shawshank Redemption is almost the perfect Hollywood film and told well enough to touch even the most jaded viewer, with an ending that brings the ultimate cinematic catharsis.",8
"Love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film.",8
"Lovely movie , very interesting. I recommend this . Thriller and full of action",9
"this film got a 5/10 because i thought the film was too long. the storyline wasn't even that good. there is some sad bits though. i don't recommend this film to be watched when tired, because it makes you fall to sleep. good acting by Morgan freeman. a highlight of the film is it does contain some interesting theories of life. the best part of the film is the ending,very touching i also enjoyed the ending because, it meant i could go to sleep. so overall not a good film, i think its over rated. thats all i have to say on this boring film.. i hope you reading this comment has stopped you from watching this film because its a waste of your time. 143 minutes to be precise.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is made and composed by Frank Darabont. It is a change of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Including Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a lender who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for unmistakably slaughtering his significant other and her sweetheart. Andy feels that its troublesome spot yet finds comfort in the connection he outlines with singular detainee Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to get when the administrator gets Andy a prison profession extra befitting his capacities as an agent. Regardless, the presence of another detainee will vastly change things for all of them.",8
the film is unique as it seems like the same old story but keeps you absolutely riveted from the opening line to the end credits and one of the things which i personally like the best is the way that we never really find out if he is innocent or not if you have not seen this movie i strongly suggest that it is one of the things that should be very high on your things to do list but dont just listen to me you can see that it is number 2 on the list,10
"I really love this movie. This make me cry. The actor acts very perfect, I like this film most ever i watch",10
What a great movie this is. One of a kind. Absolutely brilliant. I watche Walking Dead and then I came here. Frank DArabont is the man!,10
This movie is the best movie I have every seen! No doubt!,10
Sorry but this cannot compete with the cat in the hat even tho it's epic the cat in the hat it 10/10 not 9/10 sorry but that's just the way it is,10
"When I watched this film, I walked out of the cinema going ""wow that was a poggers film"" however the cat in the hat is just a better film in every regard.",9
"The movie seems to have gotten such a high rating, it's totally awesome. What should I say that no one else has said before? It's the story, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how you feel. Sometimes you watch a movie and you don't remember it days later, this movie loves you with you, once you watch it, you don't forget.

Everyone who has to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of the film's title, or how a 1/2 hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is cinematic masterpiece directed by Frank Darabont, is the movie of all movies. It has touches of many themes from different types of genres such as drama, action, adventure, crime and mystery. We see brilliant acting from both Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding and we also see the amazing and in my opinion a standout in this film James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen.

Morgan Freeman narrates the movie perfectly with his soft southern tone of voice soothing to the listeners. The scenes of the movie were shot beautifully and the prison looked spectacular when panned out in a shot. The film, being an adaption of a Stephen King short story, has become one of his best stories along with another personal favorite of mine The Green Mile (1999).

This is a truly touching movie and receives my highest recommendation. 10 Stars!",10
"Best movie I have ever seen.If you did not see it you don't know what your missing out on. I can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie. But I saw it was going to be on TV tonight so I sat down and watched it. It was time well spent. The acting was excellent (especially Tim Robbins), the storyline was interesting...everything was great. As another reviewer mentioned, the time flies by when you're watching it. When the movie finished, I looked at the clock and was amazed that 3 hours had gone by. A movie about life, about freedom and about friendship. This movie is just perfect.Each time i see it, i learn something else. This movie gives you a different meaning about freedom. Great performances of Morgan Freeman",10
Damn this is easily on the top 10 movies that i've watched,10
"There is nothing to add to all of the comments posted here about this, one of the greatest films ever made, except this: a key component to how extraordinarily effective this masterpiece is Thomas Newman's marvelous soundtrack. It stands by itself as a work of pure genius. Not only is it endlessly listenable as a composition (Mr. Newman needs to repurpose this soundtrack into a ""Shawshank Suite""), but it is a perfect melancholic/triumphant underscore of the moving images it supports with perfect synchronization. This soundtrack is a work of dazzling beauty.",7
You learn that in deep of disappointment there is a sign of hope is waiting for you . This is the main subject of movie and I believe Tim Robbins act this message in his character perfectly .,10
"Anyone that has ever experienced hardship through no fault of their own will agree. First movie I have ever seen that draws tears with a happy ending. VERY INSPIRING. I even named my son Andy because of this movie....GET BUSY LIVING OR GET BUSY DYING...that's god damn right! Anyone can get caught in their own personal Shawshank..This movie is a great guide on how to deal with bad luck. Weather the storm and never lose hope!! The ending with Red is great! It is impossible to say what my favorite tune is...Without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time. The brainless trolls can watch the big budget films all the want.. If you are a Shawshank fan, another great movie to watch is The Way, Way Back.",10
Very impressive. I really learn much from this movie. One of the favorite.,10
Life changing movie love always. All time favorite.,10
This is one of the best Hollywood romantic Movie i have come across. You should watch it worth of sharing !,10
I have watched this movie 2 times. I liked it very much. Thank you all the team members.,9
"This is the movie you wanna watch if you're sad, happy, angry, or confused. This movie will suck you into it's world, and leave you mindblowed with various feelings. This movie is among the finest films ever made.

Hopefully you too will get this sensation of watching this masterpiece. Freeman shows what great talent he has, though it is truly Robbins who gives the movie its soul and heart. I remember tghinking of this movie several days after watching it. it came up when i had to make choices. The dilemmas of the movie can easily be related to your own lives. Masterpiece. Excellence. Love. Peace.",9
Best movie ever.ahhhhhhh. OMG. Everything about the story is amazing.,8
"An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top ""prison"" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more.

Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through.

Love it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its spirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream to do in life...",8
"This movie makes me cry. Seriously, this is one of the most heart breaking movies I have ever seen. However, this is also one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. This movie is just phenomenal and is the best one I've ever seen.

This movie gives me a new perspective on freedom. The characters of this movie give outstanding performances and I care for each and every one for each of them. A 10/10 movie.",9
"I love This Movie.

I Watch movie with my friend and we love this movie.

This movie is Best Movie I Have Ever Seen.

I suggest you to watch this movie.",10
"Astonishing. Simply perfect. This is by far my favorite movie and I'm sure that every single guy/girl out there who ever watched it or will ever watch it will ""fall for it"" just the way I did. I never really liked long movies, but this one made me resist 'till the end and believe me, people, it was not just me. All of my friends and all the people I know that saw this told me the exact same thing. So just stop searching. Andy's struggle is a lesson. A very important lesson to anyone. Anyone can find something to learn in it. So just watch it, please, and rate 10 stars and then share your opinions so that more and more people would watch it and share and so on.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and moving film that explores themes of hope, friendship, and resilience in the face of adversity. It is also a scathing indictment of the American prison system, which is often portrayed as being corrupt, dehumanizing, and unjust.

What makes The Shawshank Redemption so special?

There are many things that make The Shawshank Redemption a special film. First and foremost, it is a beautifully told story with complex and well-developed characters. Andy Dufresne is a man of unwavering hope and determination, even in the darkest of circumstances. Red is a wise and compassionate man who has seen it all, but still maintains a sense of humanity. The supporting cast is also excellent, with memorable performances from Bob Gunton as the sadistic Warden Norton, William Sadler as the brutal Captain Hadley, and Clancy Brown as the menacing inmate Hadley.

Another thing that makes The Shawshank Redemption so special is its realistic portrayal of prison life. The film does not shy away from the harsh realities of incarceration, but it also shows that there can be moments of joy and even friendship behind bars. The film's message of hope is ultimately one of its greatest strengths.

The Shawshank Redemption as a social commentary

The Shawshank Redemption is also a powerful social commentary on the American prison system. The film shows how the system can be corrupt and dehumanizing, and how it can chew up and spit out innocent people. Andy Dufresne's wrongful conviction and subsequent incarceration is a prime example of the injustices that can occur within the prison system.

The film also explores the issue of rehabilitation. Andy Dufresne is a model prisoner who uses his skills and intelligence to help others. However, the prison system is not designed to rehabilitate inmates. Instead, it is focused on punishment and control. This is evident in the character of Warden Norton, who is more interested in using Andy's skills for his own personal gain than he is in helping him become a productive member of society.

Conclusion

The Shawshank Redemption is a classic film that deserves to be seen by everyone. It is a story of hope, friendship, and resilience in the face of adversity. It is also a powerful social commentary on the American prison system. The film is beautifully told, well-acted, and thought-provoking. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.

In addition to the above, here are some other thoughts on the film:

The Shawshank Redemption is a masterclass in storytelling. Darabont's screenplay is perfectly paced and structured, and he builds suspense and tension beautifully. The film is also visually stunning, with Roger Deakins' cinematography capturing the beauty and despair of Shawshank Prison.

The performances in The Shawshank Redemption are all top-notch. Tim Robbins is simply brilliant as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career as Red. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Clancy Brown all delivering standout performances.

The Shawshank Redemption is a film that stays with you long after you have seen it. It is a film that makes you think about the importance of hope, friendship, and resilience. It is also a film that challenges you to think about the American prison system and its flaws.

Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece of cinema. It is a film that everyone should see at least once in their lifetime.",10
"This movie is pure excellency.I love every aspect of it.It's one of those movies that you can watch many times without getting bored.

The story is about Andy, played by Tim Robbins, who has just been found guilty and sent to prison to serve a life sentence,where he meets Red,played by Morgan Freeman, and with time they form a bond.

Shawshank Redemption has it all,and during the movie you can feel a big spectrum of emotions,from feeling happy for the characters,angry at them,fearing for their well being,and being really sad for them.This movie takes you on a roller coaster ride through all of those.The acting is top notch and the actors performance is so good that you can see the personality of each character and start bonding with them.One of my favourite things about this movie is the Morgan Freeman's narrating skill,you can easily see the movie through his eyes due to his convincing acting.It also shows how people, when they get locked up for a long amount of time,start to adapt that kind of life,the prison becomes their world and in time ,that's all they know.Their life used to be bigger,but now it got scaled down to simple pleasures.For an example, when the guards but the prisoners a few beers,they get really happy,they feel free once again,well at least for a couple of minutes.

I would recommend it to everyone 10/10",10
Una de las mejores de la historia. Junto con the godfather. He visto esta pelicula muchas veces pero nunca me aburro.,10
The closest to perfection among any movie I have ever watched. The feeling was something else entirely.,10
"This movie is the go-to one for me whenever I feel down or whenever I need some sort of motivation. This is something more than just a movie and seeing that it was made in 1994 was really unbelievable. The BGMs in the movie keep it alive every minute and even every second of the movie. It is like, it potrays something that had happened for real, damn! The movie will remain in your mind forever even if you had watched it only once. I'm not a big fan of reviews but this movie made me to write such a lengthy review. Speaking about the characters in the movie, damn they had nailed it! A big high-five for the director who got the best out of 'em! The camera-man, yo' man, your work was perfect like a pearl! The music artists, you made a lot of people's day! This movie will melt even the hardest hearts, it will always keep you engaged, for each and every second! I wonder, how such movies keep us hooked and kindle our hearts like anything! A big heart to everyone on the set! Long live, people!",10
My life has changed completely because of this movie. The reason why so many people like this movie is because there are so many people who want to see life better. The reason I liked it was because it really showed the meaning of living.,9
I had always hear of this movie just never took the time to sit down and watch it. Then one day I did.... WOW!!!! I was amazed and touched by the performances and the story. Great movie and I regret not watching it sooner.,9
.The Shawshank Redemption is directed by Frank Darabont. It is a masterpiece and will lives on your mind forever. Though it was released since 1994 which is almost 3 decades already but yet no any film could beat it. I JUST SUPER LOVED IT.,6
"This is the only movie got 10 stars from me. Although there are many great movies that deserve 10 stars, I had to make this movie special, and give 10 stars only to The Shawshank Redemption. The best movie ever made so far.

There is something very special about this movie that I cannot even describe. It just affects you deeply, and you start having hopes. The acting is perfect. The story is told very good and progressively gives you excitement. It has a heartwarming end despite the all the sad stories that are told during the movie. This movie will stay as the best movie of all time. It deserves to be in the first place, because the throne is only for kings. It cannot be shared.",9
It one of the best movies I have seen. The storytelling is awesome. Characters are well elaborated.,6
"A movie in which I have various emotions while watching, you will not find much better than this, I would say start without hesitation.",10
"This film was seemingly perfect. The writing, Acting, Directing and cinematography is flawless. Every character is well developed and gives you a connection to any of them emotionally.",10
"I've seen a lot of movies in my days.. This one was fine, but not the best. A movie should keep you entertained, not make you think - ""When is this going to END?""

Did not deserve to be N1 in IMDb. All that surrealism, mostly boring in parts even disturbing. Maybe few of you will enjoy it, but I think it would be better if there was more done in less time rather than the opposite. The same old stuff happens, like a soup opera. You like it in the binging, you say to your self - ""This will be good, IMDb was right."" but an hour later you think "" Yeaah, been there done that, lets turn it off.."".

Think about it, was this the best you've ever seen? No?",10
"Andy is a prime example of how hope can save souls, and this movie does a great job in pacing and telling this story.",10
This movie is a beautiful piece of ART. So unpredictable. Love the treatment and the justification done to the story. I was completely mesmerised when the complete unfolding of the incidents happened. The way dialogues were placed and used is simply amazing. This is the year I passed my tenth grade and had a chance to watch this first-hand. At that time I could not English. But the visuals kept me ringing. Recently I again saw the movie by chance at a friend's place and could understand it. The beauty of story telling is great and mesmerising. I would like to see it again whenever I get a chance.,10
I have See many Time. I Like That. That's Very intrusting. I Saw That a lot of times.,10
The best movies of all time. It is really a great movie which shows how a calm common man can use his mind and trick each and every. It gives us a motive that every silent man is not weak.,9
"Like the title, no need any another word....................................................................................",10
"AWESOME MOVIE EVER !! I like it every part moment, i think the shawshank redemption best movie ever..",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has been voted the best film of all time after thousands of LADbible readers responded to a poll on Twitter featuring the top four ranked movies on IMDb. Of course, it's not an exact science, but enough people voted to make it a significant cross-section of people.",10
"""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"".

''Get busy living or get busy dying"" The Shawshank Redemption is a film about hope. It is a film about perseverance, patience, and friendship. It is a lasting modern-day classic. The film is centered on two men, each serving a different Prison life sentence, and thus becoming close friends in the prison. The film was written and directed by Frank Darabont. And it is an adaptation of Stephen King's novella -""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"".

In the film, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding(Morgan Freeman) gives a narration of the lives of the Prisoners inside the Prison wall of a prison called ""Shawshank"". A place where, a prisoner can rediscover himself - 'Redemption"". The movie begins with the scene, where a man parks his car in front of his house, obviously sober and drunk. This man is known as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) then reaches for his gun which he kept in the glove compartment of his car and loads the gun with rounds of .38 caliber bullets. Apparently, that night Andy's wife and her lover, Mr. Glenn Quentin, were both inside the house in front of where Andy parked his car.

The next scene was inside a Courtroom where Mr. Andy Dufresne, a banker was convicted and found guilty of murdering his wife, and her lover. And sentenced two two life sentences, back to back.

""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) is also an inmate of the Shawshank Prison and he was also serving a life sentence in prison. Fred's narration spoke about his friends in the prison, other fellow prisoners, the corrupt Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), the Captain of the prison guards (Captain Hardly).

Ellis ""Red"" Redding narrated about how he first saw Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) the day the Prison Bus drove into Shawshank with New inmates-""Fresh Fish"". Red and his fellow friends made bets on who will be the first amongst the ""fresh fish"" to break down in tears and cry, during the first night in the prison. And of course ""Red"" placed a bet on Andy Dufresne, who definitely looks like some who will definitely break down and cry like a baby. But Andy proved Red wrong.

Andy though a smart, well-educated, and intelligent former banker surprised everyone inside the Shawshank prison. Many respected his quietness, calmness, determination, and also a sense of hope of one day getting out of the prison wall. Red, Andy's close pal, and fellow prison inmate through the years began to like and respect the man called Andy Dufresne through the years. Andy Dufresne fended off some sadistic fellow male prisoners - 'the Sisters' who continually harassed, beat, and wanted to physically harm and have sex with him (homosexuals).

Years later Andy found out that he was innocent of the crime that the Judge said he committed. As a fresh young prison inmate, Tommy later told both Andy and Red that one day he heard a former cellmate of his in another prison boasting of how he killed a banker's wife and her lover, but no one knew. But instead, the wife's husband was convicted of the crime and sentenced to life imprisonment. This made Andy go ahead and tell Warden Norton, which a big mistake Andy was made. This is because Warden Norton did not want the innocent Andy Dufresne to go to court and prove his innocence. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) saw Andy as a very resourceful Prisoner due to his skill and knowledge Tax preparation, Tax filing, and bookkeeping abilities. Also, Andy did a good job of restoring the Prison's library and got State Grants to equip the Prison library with books.

In the Prison unknowingly to Red, Andy has been so hopeful and planning his escape from Shawshank prison. And for about twenty years, with the help of a 'Rock Hammer"" (Red- the man who can get you whatever you need), Andy dug a tunnel through the wall in his prison cell, he escaped the prison yard. He escaped to a town very close to the Pacific Ocean (in Mexico).

Years later Ellis Boyd 'Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) was granted parole. Red not enjoying this his new life, and of course not wanting to end up like his very old friend - Brooks the Old Librarian, who was granted parole and ended up committing suicide. Red later skipped parole, and with the help of his friend Andy Dufresne, he was able to escape also to the Pacific Ocean near the Town of ""Zihuatanejo"".

Shawshank Redemption received Seven Oscar nominations and a host of other nominations and a few awards. Watching and learning from this Drama can help you stay hopeful about life when it seems that there is no hope. It is one of the best films of the 20th Century. ""Never give up on life, when it seems that life has been so cruel to you'",9
A fantastic movie with great structure that shows the powers of hope. A must see for everyone.,10
What an awesome movie! It takes such a deep dive into the hearts of men. Great story and great production.,10
The acting is wonderful and the story is extremely moving. I highly recommend checking it out because it truly stands the test of time.,9
"Brave to run to freedom, Shawshank's redemption is worth watching.",10
"What such a amazing movie.

Best friendship movie i ever seen.

And good drama.",10
This is the best movie for defining the life. I watched this movie atleast 7 times.,10
"I need to be in a strong place to appreciate this film, it is intense and lingers. Reflective.",10
"The first time I saw this movie, it reflects an awesome reflection and I kept wondering, why Hollywood doesn't introduce one movie like this one every year at least, really it was a wonderful watching experiment.",10
"For once a movie that features a story we want to follow, character development, marvelous acting and an ending that is original and empowering.

This film deserves all the accolades.

How soon will Hollywood be shooting the gender switch version (LMFAO!!!)?",5
Hope is a 4 letter word for few and 26 alphabets for most of us. It means everything!,10
This movie gives u a smile and a good thought of living a lfe.,7
I don't know how many times I have seen this wonderful movie each time experiencing the different feelings. The movie tells about the love friendship life and hope.,10
"I've seen this movie multiple times, but I still think it's really good. It's not the best movie of all time to me but still very close to the top. The characters are interesting and varied, and they all play their roles well. The twist at the end is amazing.",10
One of the best movie i have ever seen. Its Very Much Helpful For Me to pass my time.,10
"The secret to the film's structure, in my opinion, is that it is about our relationship with the hero - our curiosity, pity, and admiration. The picture would have been more conventional and less mysterious if Andy had been the heroic core, bravely enduring.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.",10
Such a movie teaches us regarding reality. I love this movie.,9
"An awesome movie with awesome story t is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.",10
"This movie teach life lessons and inspiring me.

Ssssss.",9
"It was a wonderfull movie, everyone should watch it.",10
"This is one of the best Hollywood movies I've seen. It shows the life of an innocent man who has been put in prison for no reason. The movie also shows his struggle in jail.

Anyone can enjoy the whole movie easily. You won't get bored at any point of the movie.",10
"One of the best movies of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama, as well as setting the standard for film. I think it will never go out of style.",10
Awesome it is too good. Awesome it is too good. Awesome it is too good. Awesome it is too good.,8
It is one of the best dramatic movie I have ever.the story is simple and pleasant.,10
"Coming up almost 3 decade's. I've watched this movie a minimum of at least a thousand times. Obsessed, probably so. Best movie in my lifetime. My emotions always choke every time I watch it. Great Actors, great story and best ending!",3
"Good movie to all. First time saw this movie in my phone . I think it was a boring , but i was shocked for last seen. Its a goal of the poisoner to free this category prisoned.",8
"The Dressing of the story is so Perfect, fabulous...",9
The Shawshank Redemption Classic movie i loved it when i was little boy.,10
"The strongest point of this masterpiece is it's completeness. No scenes are unrealistic and illogical, drama and acting are just wow. Has the greatest impact in my life. Highly recommended.",10
"I have seen this movie many times. But every time i watch it i ask myself why it looks fresh every time. After a lot of thoughts i am able to understand that it ignites hope even in darkest times of anyones life.

I still prefer to watch this every 6 months.",10
This movie motivates you. A must watch movie. Fine art.,7
"Written and directed by Frank Darabont in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption is a film about a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly accused of and sent to prison for the murder of his cheating wife and her lover. During his stay in prison he becomes a financial adviser to the guards and the warden. The warden is involved in taking bribes and enlists Andy to hide this illegal money. Andy befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) the guy in the joint that can get things on the inside and they become close friends throughout the movie. This is a well written story and seemed to be a good escape from everyday life, but does not qualify as one of my all time favorite movies. I thought that filming most of the movie in a prison was kind of boring and the lack of action or any type of visual effects made it a little dull. This is not a movie I would watch again and again. The pace is just so slow.",8
Best climax ever in any movie till now. Must watch movie if you find yourself for hope. Please do watch it. It inspires you from tp to bottom.,10
"A must watch film for all. It is Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable! Some of the greatest cast working on this show and still today they are delivering such great work.",6
Something was mistake. The movie is best I have ever seen but.,10
"Good movie i really experienced sad emotions while i was watching it. Jk i laughed at how the Morgan handled things and i strongly do not support that.Casting was done poorly.Overall a bad film that got a lot of attention.If u want to whip and sorrow watch this junk and enjoy it i guess.Nothing more to be added, mediocre attempt at filming.",10
"Super brilliant films , which make me super confident.",7
Everyone before me has explained why the movie is good no need for me to add movie is one the greatest films ever made. The acting is phenomenal and I can watch it over and over again without being bored. It's a experience to watch it.,10

"The first time i saw the Shawshank Redemption i hadn't heard much about it. It was recommended to me by my big brother who had seen it in school. I was amazed, never had i seen such a capturing movie. I was stunned, and especially because this movie had not spend millions of dollars on hi-fi special effects. Tim Robbins played brilliant, I dont understand that he isn't payed as much for his films as; Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, they couldn't have played this role as convincing as he did, he was fantastic.

"Best film of the century. Must watch!

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an outstanding film that truly stands the test of time. The film boasts an incredibly talented cast, with standout performances from Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red. One of the film's greatest strengths is its ability to balance drama, humor, and hope in a way that never feels forced or contrived. It's a movie that deals with heavy themes like injustice, corruption, and the prison system, but it never loses sight of the humanity of its characters. In conclusion, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a must-see film that has earned its place as a classic of the genre. It's a powerful, moving, and inspiring story that will stay with you long after the credits roll. Whether you're a fan of drama, comedy, or just great filmmaking in general, this movie is not to be missed.",10
"Usually when i watch a film i become analytical of certain aspects (ie acting, direction etc.) but on this occasion I totally became lost in the film, totally gripped by the drama and storyline. It's not often you can become lost in a film lot but this totally draws you in.

Probably the best film I have ever seen and a 10 out of 10 is certainly rare by anyones standards. Not often can a film hit such a wide audience like this one can. It is truly versatile in its production.

Well casted, the characters are totally believable and at no time can you doubt a reaction or performance.

If you haven't seen this yet, you must watch as soon as possible!",9
This is just a awesome movie i seen ever. Full story is just a thriller and too much enjoyeble.,9
"Great movie, great actors.

Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman really blows your mind in this motion picture.

Andy & Reds partnership is well worth while. Andy is - as promised, full of surprises and saves his best for last.",10

"The best movie I have ever seen -- by a mile. Everything about it is brilliant. A classic you can watch time and again without tiring of it.

It's Wonderfull. Mind Blowing.,10
The best film I have ever seen in all my life. I loved both Tim Robbins and Moegan Freeman's acting. It was fabulous and very natural.,10
"This is a fantastic film. It's well-crafted, the acting is excellent, and the cast members are endearing (or, in the case of the pigs, repulsive).",10
"The Shawshank Redemption help me to understand that why life is important. ""Hope is a good thing probably best of all & good thing never dies ."" This line from this movie shows the actual truth what humanity need most . "" The Shawshank redemption "" is based upon legendary stephen king's novel which represents very truth of life never lose hope because it probably best of all . Great direction by frank darabondt , impeccable script , screenplay , towering performances by cast made this movie greatest movie ever made . Duffrian's relentless effort to get away from prison life stands him alone from others , life in prison is totally different one just have to confront his /her fear trauma , one has to tackle with them else life will be nothing less than hell , also keep your mind busy as mind itself can be most troubled thing in prison life if it remained unattended . Casting is another great thing about this movie , characters of Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman have been crafted by director so perfectly that they have become great source of inspiration for all. I personally belive this movie is life learning lesson , everyone must need to watch this movie and understand how difficult traumatic life could be ,one of the the scene where one of the inmate committed suicide when he was released from prison and allowed to live a common man life as it was tough for him to adjust with society like he has become accustomed to prison life , that harrowing reality will shock you how traumatic life could be . This great movie is absolutely an evershing gem of world cinema . Don't miss this great movie it's a life time experience of a kind you won't ever forget.",9

Best I have ever watched. I usually don't watch movies but this stolen my heart.,10
"The main actors are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, who give a very convincing and realistic performance of their characters.

The plot is simply wonderful, very emotional and with unexpected twists.

The ending is one of the best in movie history.",10
"I have never seen such a legendary movie. It was a very good movie. I strongly recommend. Watch it, show it.",10
"This movie to me is one of my favorites. This is the only movie i would have to say is a better movie then the book even though it a short story. (i don't consider this a spoiler to the movie but a little spoiler to the book so....) in the book there were multiple warden going over the years Andy spent in Shawshank but in the movie i have to say did a better job of directing the hate words a single warden witch manipulated Mr.Dufresne to the end of his sanity.

There were even more parts to affect the story in the oppose direction as well. In other word, ways that parts of the book are even better than the movie, not really the manipulation of the main story line but side story that takes place that would explain more in the main story to emotion or long term affects. Side stories that take place in Shawshank. For example in the book here is a story about a guy that was a stamp collector and how something happened to the guy (would say but don't want to spoiled) and his stamp collection is hidden n Shawshank somewhere and is worth a lot of money but since no one can find his hiding place that story kind of turned into a myth or legend.

Even in the book red wasn't Morgan at all. Morgan freeman brought red to life; in more ways than one.",10

"It is so funny how the justice system is back then and even now. They try to impose the max sentenced allowed without the fact or on some false or beefed up charges. But the final say is never theirs because you can never keep a bird that is meant to fly free caged for very long. I like that fact that Andy never let the best get the best of him. H.O.P.E. (H)aving (O)nly (P)ositive (E)xpectation.. never losing site that anything and everything is possible even in the hands of the law. Hoep changes everything. In the Andy got the last laugh, all the way to the bank then to an island looking at the beautiful blue ocean and repairing his boat. Like I said, you can never keep a bird caged for very long.",10
Best movie i have ever seen in my life even my family also seen this movie they also amazed to see this awesome movie.,10
"One of the most underrated films of all time!

It is such a masterpiece, you should watch over and over!",10
"The best movie of all time.

A movie that will remembered by all of us with all the scenes in our heart.",10
"Yet, I've watched a number of inspirational and motivational movies, though this became the most influential for me. The lesson I got is to never loose the hope though the challenge is the toughest one. Even you're in a dark work, then don't wait for the light to rise, but find ways anyway. At all, it inspire me to stand up again and do something good for myself as life will be end someday, and we don't have to remain unworthy. Thanks to the film directors.",10
There are scenes in this movie that are so iconic that it's still being referenced today.,10
"This is the best film I have ever seen. there where so many twists and more than one plot running at the same time. A great piece of film making. I feel the ending was the perfect ending, I know how they where going to end the film, with Morgan Freeman on the bus hoping to see his friend. my all time best film.",10
"This is the best story driven movie ever, and yet until the end it doesn't have any forceful direction in plot, it doesn't need it. All the lead up is a natural story, which is allowed to evolve and expand in a way that is so humanly aware and so subtle that it's remarkable. I remember showing this movie to some friends after I'd seen it and a parent walked in about halfway through and asked ""was it good?"" they all said it was enthralling and amazing, then the parent added ""what's it about?"". There was a pause, because everyone realised that to summarise this movie would undermine what it is about in every way possible: every nuance and intricacy is important, and they deserve every minute of screen time that they are generously awarded. We grow into the characters so well that we aren't surprised by how they behave, because we can understand it. Even the apparently crazy antics of Brooks is wholly comprehensible. Then there's the music, amazingly visual and emotionally abundant in content. The movies so good that it doesn't need music to drive it, but when the music is of such astounding quality you begin to get a real resonance of mood, and an extra dimension of depth in the already amazing aesthetics of the cinematography. Whether everyone else is blown away by this movie doesn't bother me, because I will know how lucky I am. Lucky that I came across this movie, and lucky that I get it... that I really get it, in a way obviously not everyone in the world can. Anyone reading this should just hope they will fall into this category, and anyone who hasn't yet should just watch it again, and again, and again... (Please note, the ending is just as perfect as the rest of the package, but in-case someone hasn't seen it yet, I don't want to give it away).",10
"This movie was one that I initially missed out on.

The film tells the tale of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a Executive at a bank in the midst of the 20th century. Andy is sentenced to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, where he meets ""Red"" or Ellis boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) as his name is. Red is the one guy that every prison has at least one of. The man you speak with if you want something from the outside.

Slowly but surely a friendship grows between them and we follow the story of how Andy who shows to be a odd individual deals with his time in the prison, and repeatedly surprises his new ""friends"" who have yet to know his real secret...

I'm really fairly sceptical about Dramas, but all i can say is...

This movie was great. That's what I'll say about it, I really enjoyed the great acting and lovely settings that really allowed you to feel as you were a part of the story being told. The characters are thought through, and you'll be treated to both moments of true sorrow and moments of joy while having this cinematic experience.

Even though I'd like to find a flaw to comment on, I can't say that I can. The story has everything it needs and the movie truly earned it's ranking among other films.

9/10",10
"Absolute Brilliant Movie, I Grew Up Watching This And i Can Not But Agree This Movie Never Gets Bored To Watch, Its A Ledgend Of A Film.",9
I must say this is one of the best cinematic creation so far.,8
"The first time I saw this movie it took my breath away, everytime I have watched it since it still has the same effect on me! One of my favourite films of all time!!!!!!!! I have recommended it to other people who have said 'it's only a prison movie', but after they have seen it they ALL changed their minds! And agree is a life changer not just a movie.",10
"Loved it.

It is a great movie to watch. It was fun watching it for the first time on My VR Glasses.

Awesom. I would surely live to watch it again with my friends.",10
"I haven't seen this movie, but I will be looking forward to it.",10
"this film is quite simply ""the greatest film of all time"" and I could wax lyrical about it all day, but I probably would'nt do it any justice by doing this.

I saw an programme made by channel 4 (u.k. tv channel) which basically took you through the film, and how this powerful film has effected people's lives. It didn't surprise me, but never the less really does sum up the effect this film can have on some people, when the presenter said that this film has actually stopped some people commiting suicide, because as these people said "" it gave them hope "". Truely I think this is an amazing thing, and the ultimate accolade to the best film I have ever seen.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is an exceptional film and a classic of modern cinema. A powerful story of hope and redemption, it is a must-watch for any movie lover.

Emmanuel simms: Take 3 !e

Mr Simms: The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic directed by Frank Darabont and released in 1994. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is wrongly convicted and sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. Despite facing a bleak future, Andy uses his wits and creativity to battle the harshness of prison life, befriending fellow inmates and eventually finding freedom in an unexpected way.

The movie is filled with strong performances, notably by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Robbins delivers an emotionally rich performance that captures all of the despair, sadness, and determination experienced by his character. Morgan Freeman's calm and collected narration adds a quiet dignity to the story as we gain insight into the lives of all the inmates of Shawshank.

The story is and always has been compelling and captivating, but what truly sets The Shawshank Redemption apart is its underlying message of hope. Throughout the film, Andy stays strong in his faith that he will survive the horrors of Shawshank and eventually earn his freedom. It serves as a reminder that, despite all of the adversities we may face in life, hope and perseverance will ultimately prevail.

The Shawshank Redemption is an enduring drama that offers insight into the human condition and demonstrates the power of resilience and hope. A must-see for movie fans of all ages, The Shawshank Redemption will leave you feeling inspired and deeply moved.",7
"This film is certainly not disposable, it stays with you for a long time after you watch it. I have to say that of all the films I have ever watched this is the most captivating. I remember going to the cinema when it was first out and only choosing it because I had missing the beginning of another picture; how fortunate I was. To see it on the big screen made the full directing and acting quality of this film apparent from the start, this is not lost on the small screen. It truly is a classic and I cannot imagine any other film knocking it off my top spot",10
"Quite possibly. Never before have I seen a film that has satisfied me in every way. The story line is excellent, the acting superb. The way the story fits together is wonderful. I cried tears of joy at the finish, partly because I was so happy for the characters, and partly because I realized I had watched one of the best films ever.",6
This movie is something I wasn't expecting to be really good. Definitely must watch!,7
"The movie is good to watch, the actors are beautiful, the effects are very good,",9
Best Movie ever It has a lot of lesson to learn and it effect me strongly.,7
"A fresh movie for people of all class... In my opinion, it is a classy film for classy people... There are a lot of things that I appreciate about the film.

Such as the acting, direction, screenplay, inspirational vibes and many more... I love the charectors --- Andy, Mr Red, Brooks... This film teaches us There is always hope... A lot of things have shown in this movie such as the emotions of the prisoners, their struggle, stress and many more such as the currupted law and order, currupted police officers, bad condition in every prison and so on... It has a strong villain... It is a film without action and hifi BGM but still it is epic... 10/10 from me.",10
"I have watched this film so many times, it was my first buy when I bought my DVD player. It is the way that Andy triumphs over the system that can't help but put you in a good mood",8
"This film never loses its quality no matter how many times you watch it. When I had access to a DVD player, it was one of the first films I bought.

I have had a bereavement in the family recently and watching this film certainly lifted my spirits.",9
"This movie does really deserve the number one ranking. It just touches your heart and mind and makes to think of the life in a way you've never looked at before. This movie is life and I think everyone should watch it at least once. It can change your perspective toward a lot of serious concepts such as the power of hope, friendship, hardships and how to overcome them, the terrible corruption in political and judgmental systems and so on. This movie is good for all ages and can be fruitful for all tastes, As you can see, it's been a long time since it has been released and yet it is the number one movie.",10
This movie taught me Life is full of hope and people have to keep trusting their skills and knowledge rather than dumb luck.,10
"It deserves to be top. Story, acting, and all stuff is amazing in this movie. One of the best films of the twentieth century. It's a must watch movie.",10
"It's difficult to review a movie made 25 years ago and say there has been nothing better since, but it is true. The storytelling and the production and the acting and the morality and the good guys and the bad guys and the hope it conveys..., But seeing this in 2021 (again) I have to say the praise is justified.

There is just something about Shawshank Redemption.",9
"Don´t get me wrong, it´s a good movie but people saying ""IT´S THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WHOLE WORLD"" haven´t seen many films.",6
Slow burn but it is very interesting. It couldn't have been any more better than this.,10
"The short story blew the movie for me, but it is still my favorite movie of all time.",10
One of the best. Movies i have ever watch The story line and cinematography are perfect.,10
"Nice Movie Dude. You must watch this movie why??? Because you must watch it, i don't want to spoiler, understood..",10
"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.

One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.",10
"I love this movie. Hollywood is awesome in movie making in each and everything for their work, editing, acting, vfx and etc. Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.",10
Great movie to watch. I watched it more than 50 times. Stephen King's best novel into Fabolous movie of all time 🔥🔥🔥,10
"I could watch this movie over and over again and still feel the same way. Hollywood did a great thing making this one, I'm in awe of the display of emotions. It is a little over 2 hours, might i say. I don't usually watch movies that long except for the ones i find interesting. But this one has affected me strongly over the years not that I'm that old tho, i recall the first time i watched this was when i was in high-school. I had to rewatch it again this year 2021 and ought to write a review.",9
This movie has nothing wrong in it with actig directing or cinematography and every person must watch it once in their life time.,10
"I like this movie very much, even the movie was created long time ago, but it's still wonderfull.",10
"Excellent movie, it's entertaining from the beginning to the end, undoubtedly one of the best movies I've seen and will remember. Another standout is the performance of the actors. Without a doubt, this movie is a guarantee of a worthwhile watch.

One of the standout aspects of the film is the exceptional acting by the cast. Every actor delivers a stellar performance, bringing their characters to life with depth and authenticity. Their chemistry on screen is palpable, making the relationships and interactions between them feel genuine and compelling.

The film's soundtrack perfectly complements the on-screen action, heightening emotions and adding an extra layer of intensity to key moments. The music perfectly reflects the mood of each scene, enhancing the storytelling and immersing the audience even further into the movie's world.",9
"This is such a good film, i wish Frank (the director) had adapted more of Kings's material. He's one of the few who could do it properly.",10
"Its a good movie so far, i give rating 10/10 for story line and acting the actor. I recomended you to watch this movie because its amazing. Hope you enjoy it.",9
"Shawshank needs to be watched more than once to fully appreciate it. This is a story that is so disparaging at times you want to cry for the character, its so totally immersing that by the end, you feel everything that they feel and along with the happy ending, is laced the whole tragic waste of life that leaves you feeling sad as well. The film itself is simply the finest piece of film making in history. There are no self-indulgent filming techniques used, no abstract elements to the story and the acting is sincere.

Based on a story by Stephen King, your getting a character driven story that is acted superbly, the part of Red, played by Morgan Freeman could not have been cast any better, he is utterly superb, as is Andy, played by Tim Robbins and the rest of the supporting cast.

If you haven't seen this film, shame on you! You owe it to yourself..",10
"I already seen this movie 4 time, and the file is catching. Very nice movie, have you want make part 2?",8
This is one of the best movie i have seen so far. I haev learned a lot of things from this movie and i will definitely suggest you to watch this once.,10
"If I could give this movie 100 stars I would. I'm an avid movie watcher and if I like movie I'll google it and give it a thumbs up, not this movie though, this is my first movie review. Shawshank Redemption is far and away the best movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching! Throughout the movie I felt happy, sad, frustrated, inspired and about almost any other emotion that I can think of! Thats what movies are about, connecting with your audience and bringing out their emotions for the characters in the movie! From the narration, to the acting, and to the story it's self, all of it was beautifully done. Out of huge respect for the film I don't want to include any spoilers so I'll leave you with this, unless your wife is in labor or your shirt is on fire, stop what you're doing and watch this movie!!",10
"A movie that has been around for a long time, but it's also quite good to watch over and over again, the kind of movie that you can't get bored of watching forever.",10
"The first time seeing this movie, it blew me away due to the performances of every actor. Stephen King's stories require special attention and detail and this production did just that. A must watch for all drama fans and of King's work.",9
"I really heard too many opinions about this movie some says it's overrated others says it's the best movie they have ever seen every side is giving their reasons ,but my view to the movie it's perfect not like it's impossible to make like it again but it's perfect like it's the best thing we have ever done . The movie calls for life anywhere even in jail which wouldn't be the end if you ended up there .",10
"How do you define perfection in a movie? For me it's a combination of direction, script, performances and all the technical aspects of making a film, so that the viewer can be transported elsewhere. This is how I define the Shawshank Redemption. If you haven't seen it, you can be surprised by the end. But even when you see it again and again, it doesn't matter if you already know the end, because the journey is as much (if not more) enjoyable. It's an amazing movie, with great performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and all supporting cast. They make you feel happy, and sad, and laugh, and cry. Movies like this don't come very often, and should be enjoyed by all. Very highly recommended!",10
"When I first saw this film I was completely blown away, it was on T.V. late at night and I was recording it after hearing about it, but after it began I couldn't stop watching it, then again the next day. This film can not be viewed by anyone just once, everybodies performance in this film is excellent, most notably the lead characters. direction, writing, just everything is amazing, and the way it makes you feel when the film ends is quite unlike any film I have ever seen, and doubt ever will again. This is a film that EVERYBODY just HAS to see, something that I have been telling all my friends since.

To illustrate how good this film is I was once asked what my favourite films were, I was in a big group of people, in which many walks of life were represented, I mentioned the Shawshank Redemption and every single person there gave out a sigh of appreciation and a slow nod.",10
Beautiful movie and nice story with perfect act and perfect producer every thing in this movie is high and deserve this rates.,10
This is a great film. Super story. I enjoyed this film very much. Love this film.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption doesn't confine itself to a genre; the crime elements are peripheral and there's more humor than one might find in a typical thriller. Instead, The Shawshank Redemption deals in universal themes that almost anyone can relate to and almost anyone can enjoy.",8
Most balanced movie I ever watched. It has every feeling scenes all over the movie. It deserve this rating.,9
There is no such thing as this movie. The way that it makes you care so much about the characters is superb. The script is flawless and the acting is amazing. However if something stands out about this film are the emotions that you feel during this beautiful cinematic journey. In my opinion the greatest movie of all time alongside Forrest Gump.10/10.,10
"This movie is a true masterpiece. The characters depict the best and the worst of human nature. Yet the take home during the last half hour is a non-stop message of hope, love, friendship, emotions, laughter, tears, decisiveness, determination and character. Poetry in images ---what memorable motion pictures are supposed to be.",9
This is Great Movie Agreed 100% No VFX Does This Movie 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Excellent Extremely Satisfied.,9
"It's and will always be my Favorite movie ever. It just can take you to the forever thinking in hope. Just finished watching for the 19th time and still interested about every little detail about the characters, story and everything. It's the kind of movies that really touches you that can make a difference in your way of thinking. all I can tell is that if you are thinking about watching this movie, you have to prepare your snack, buy an HD version, close all the lights and really enjoy. it just makes you curious about freedom for example. some scenes have to be replayed times and times again. I really enjoyed watching the great Morgan Freeman best performance ever. It's really recommended if you are feeling depressed or down. also on of the most thing it's gonna affect you about is the Friendship, Really glad to watch such a great movie.",8
The Shawshank Redemption is one of them collection movies.,10
"Every second was like being glued to the screen, everybit just well thought out and well executed.",10
"Love it!!! What more can I say?! I love the storyline, the ending - not what I expected. Strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Shawshank is a classic. Captivating and so moving with so little in the way of action. Morgan Freeman putting in brilliantly scripted, brilliantly acted narrative. A film with many emotions which pulls you in from start to finish. Genius Film making of the highest standard with some standout performances. A impressive, engrossing piece of film-making. Very good performances. Simple story but well told. An altogether truly brilliant film. A very watchable, well shot movie.",9
This movie is one that grips you from the start till the very end. Tim Robbins does a great job keeping the plot interesting and his character constantly evolving in the storyline.,10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is my favorite movie. It's based on a story by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont. This film has left a deep impact on me.

The story takes place in a prison in New England and revolves around two prisoners, Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) and Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman). The story unfolds and you will never expect how this is going to end.

The movie also touches on themes that I find relatable as someone from India. It emphasizes hope and friendship. Despite the challenges the characters face, they find a way to hold onto hope and support each other. The movie is based on the key emotional element ""Hope"" as I quote Andy ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""

The performances by the actors are exceptional. Tim Robbins portrays Andy, who's wrongly imprisoned, with a lot of depth. His transformation from vulnerability to strength is inspiring. Morgan Freeman as Red brings wisdom and warmth to the character, and his narration adds an extra layer of connection.

The visuals and cinematography effectively capture the emotions of the characters.

The movie's music, composed by Thomas Newman, complements the story beautifully. I love the opera scene, It made the prisoners feel an inch of freedom, symbol of hope and it gives them something from the outside world to connect to. This shows that the prisoners can connect with things that belong in the outside world.

In conclusion, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless masterpiece that has a universal appeal. Its themes, performances, storytelling, and artistic presentation create a memorable movie that continues to stay with me.",10
"The best movie ever is a subjective term.

Deciding on the best movie of all time requires a balance between objectivity and subjective preference, which can be different for industry professionals and general audiences. We took the top 250 movies on IMDb and Metacritic and assigned each movie a score based on the range of scores in the dataset. These equally weighted scores are summed and then normalized to our own Screen Rant score. The result is a rating system that gives equal and fair credit to audiences and critics, resulting in a list that spans the entire history of cinema .

If I had one criterion for choosing the best picture, it would be the emotional criterion. Somehow these movies hit me hard. Movies are the greatest art form of all time, designed to evoke emotion in the audience. It does it best. (If instead you pleaded for dance or music, theater or painting, I would answer that cinema contains all these arts).

There are only two ways to discuss the greatest movies of all time. You either pick your favorite and put it on the mat, or you create a list so extensive you're sure you've covered every nook and cranny of the cinema. That's what we're trying to do here - find the best of the entire movie. The starting point is covered. Romance, natural disaster epic, and thriller are all here too. Bang your fists on the table while yelling ""You can't handle the truth!"" while declaring Citizen Kane the best! Fun (even if you're streaming a movie here), but not as fun as having the whole list at your fingertips.",8
"Excellent story, best cast, you can't ask for better performance!",7
Amazing movie You will watching it over and over Without any felling boring.,10
"Amazing... Great Acting. Prison movies fascinates every one.

This is one of the most fascinating movie ever.",8
Nice movie and really awesome. Plan for make movie again.,10
The most amazing experience to witness onscreen. Best movie of lifetime.❣❤❣ Sometime words are not enough to describe the thing. All I know is that it gave me the hope which I needed.,10
"I am really like this movie, very interesting but I do not understand why this movie number one in all movie lists.",10
"This is one of the best movie of hollywood, top rated movie in the world.

Every one must watch this movie in lifetime.",9
"The 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the best film ever made!!!Personally i think it is the number one not far away from other great films.What i love on this film is that it shows how people can reach freedom and happiness even when they are desperate. It shows that there is always a hope and anybody can reach his dream if he believes in himself...When i first watched the movie i was very surprised with the happy ending.I almost cried. I also liked the Morgan Freeman's description that makes the story more attractive. Other things i like on the film is that it 'talks' about life's simple and important values such as friendship , partnership , fellow feelings and simple moments of life enjoy.",8
Best Movies that Every People Can Seen Once . Robbins and freeman and everybody else gives the best performance .,10
"This is the only movie I have ever decided to rate and I watched many, but there is something about this movie that deeply touches my heart and that something is ultimately the underlying theme of the whole movie, which is hope. Many movies leave you scratching your head because of their complexity or what have you or leave your miserable because of how the characters behave or how the movie ends. Rarely does a movie leave you smiling for minutes after it ends, wondering about its brilliancy and, above all, leave you fulfilled and glad that you took your precious time to watch it. This is exactly what this movie is, precious and fulfilling, and as such I believe that it is my duty and good will to rate this movie a well deserved 10/10, for no movie deserves the title of the #1 rated movie on IMDb as much as The Shawshank Redemption, a true masterpiece of a film.",9
"This movie is truly a mind blowing movie. The stoy and cast is amazing, this movie can connect with any viewer and touch your heart and soul in a way like never before.",10
"The prison drama is beyond time. The performances of all the characters are excellent. Dialogues keep ringing well after the film has been watched. However what really sets this apart is the game of detachment, hope and determination to think beyond one's present circumstances. It is too good. A must watch. Rather a many times watch.",10
A very good movie. Worth watching.brilliant movie. One of the most memorable movies that you won't forget about.,8
Movie was dramatic and I loved it.and I would seriously recommend this movie to anyone else that would love to watch it to be honest.,10
This was an epic film with 2 unlikely Actors with great on screen chemistry.,10
"If you are not doing the things you wanted or getting the things you wanted. Man you are in prison or worse than some prisoners. You can do better.

This is not just a movie. It's drug man that make you think what a human can do.",10
No words to describe how I felt after watching this movie. It touches you to the core and makes you see your life from a whole different perspective. Unbelievable work of art!,10
"You have already watched this, right? It is really easy to understand the love for this movie. I'll admit, when it comes to movie adaptations of books, the book is always better. Great Movie! Agreed.",9
"You don't get emotive, engaging story telling like this any more. Every aspect of the film, from the cinematography to the performances are top notch. The beauty of the film is that even the smaller characters have a story to tell, a journey to take you on, which seems to be completely missing in films now a days. Though Stephen King is normally associated with horror, this story is very human and touching, to the point where it becomes inspirational. In fact it has been King's non horror stories that seemed to have been most successful at being adapted into movies. This movie along with Stand by Me, though I'm sure many will disagree with me on that point. Well worth a watch when you're having a quiet night in.",9
Imagine a movie you enjoy watching over and over again and it doesn't get boring anyhow. This is definitely one of them.,10
"A film about patience and resilience. Everything in life with determination and planning can be done. Good script and good fluidity. Justice is not always done ... but there will always be a way out. Tim Robins and Morgan freeman show good chemistry. The story is verisimilitude, without being too fanciful. Certainly good public acceptance, it is no wonder that it is the first on IMDb. Got good reviews. It's an optimistic film that shows us the good side of perseverance and calm. Nothing's desperation to end well ... as good conquers evil ... if it is strong enough for this. Although slight, for a film of prison, known to be strong when needed. Excellent movie.",10
"In my opinion, the best film ever made. This film is totally plot driven, and is totally unique in story-line. The directing and cinematography are astounding, with aerial views of Shawshank prison. One example of this is when Andy plays ""Duettino-Sull 'Aria"" from ""The Marriage of Figaro"". The camera flies up into the sky like a bird, while all the inmates look up at the speaker. Truly an amazing film. WATCH IT!!!!!",10
"This film says everything about the world we live in today, but most importantly give us a sense of hope in our future existence. As a film which basic plot, if considered could of so easily been a flop at the box office. Shawshank turns out to be a movie of the ages, through it stunning cinematography, editing and directing, in no way forgetting its remarkable ensemble crowned in my opinion by the astronomically well realised narration of Morgan Freeman. Tim Robbin execution of Andy not only boasts an inate sense of naturalism that Stanislavski himself would be proud of but characterisation that conveys all emotion that encycles the movie. I short a movie of a generation and of the ages. A must see for any true fan of cinema.",9
"In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece.

Actors play their parts exceptionally well. This movie is not only emotional and involving, but also seamlessly character-driven.

There are scenes which make one angry, ones which make one cry and ones which make one euphoric.

It is also a story of justice and hope of course. The guard and the warden tell the prisoner to do questionable things, perhaps illegal things and make it clear that he has no choice in the matter. They believe their control is absolute. Yet, this is an illusion and it is they who are being led in reverse.

Shawshank has a superpower that could entertain and amuse anyone. Then one looks at the credits' section of IMDB and notes that the director has essentially not done anything else since.

Amazing. He must be a man of integrity.

In my view, this movie is unique. The Shawshank Redemption is a touching drama that is worth the time and purchase.",10
Amazing! Love it from the start to the end. This is a masterpiece for me that I can rewatch regularly from the beginning to the end.,10
"No doubt THE best movie I have ever watched. The plot, the storyline and locations are perfectly paired with a fantastic cast. The Shawshank Redemption will be rewatched many times by me.",10
"Watched it over and over, never felt bored for a sec! Truly it is one of the top creations EVER.",6
The best film. I like it. Esaretin bedeli in turkish name.,10
"A great movie! My family watched many many times, and it is stll on my list to watch it again. Remarkable actors and you will enjoy every moment of their play!",10
"Andy Dufrunse (a young banker) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her secret lover, and is given a life imprisonment sentence which he will serve back to back. At Shawshank prison, he befriends the prison hustler, Red (who is known for getting things). Andy soon becomes a respected prisoner at Shawshank, he sets up the library, does tax returns for prison Warderns, helps fellow prisoners pass their collage degrees and so forth. His friendship with Red grows stronger. Red and his crew suspect that Andy is about to reach a breakdown... you will also think alike as well - given the set up of the film. But wait a minute, the film delivers a killer twist that will leave your mouth wide open... you will be amazed just how little it takes to break through toughest prison walls. I",10
"I realize that my screen name might belie my opinion of the film, but I have seen it several times and still find it difficult to forget. The Shawshank Redemption is the finest film I have ever seen, and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 13.

While there are some scenes that warrant an R rating, they are done professionally and are used to tell a story--not to simply shock the viewer. The plot is deep and twisting, but is not difficult to understand on a basic level.

What makes Shawshank better than most films, however, is the use of several sub plots (often metaphors) to enhance the tale of Banker Andy Dufresne and Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, respectively). Both do the finest work of their careers, in my opinion, in this film.

Even more amazing is the cinematogrophy. Director Frank Darabont made his debut with Shawshank, and captures old Mansfield Penitentiary wonderfully. I can't say that I enjoy watching any movie more than this one.",10
"I cannot think of one reason I would not give this 10/10 just out of principle. Otherwise, it is the perfect movie with an incredible story, acting and euphoric finale that nonetheless is not without tragedy in the meantime.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films of all time, and is considered the best drama ever. If you ask the people on the street what is the best movie ever, you will probably hear the name of this film. Although it was built without the expectation of a high box office, it produced a great interest in the whole world, which attracted great attention (this type of film was called sleeper). morgan freeman and tim robbins' best films wouldn't be wrong. The story of two prisoners who met in prison and were close friends. An impressive scenario, flawless acting and a legend. As if you are having the movie you are caught up in the story. so much so that no one could have been touched in the final with no sense of age. Many scenes and dialogs on the internet are still breaking records on the Internet. a film that definitely and strictly needs to be monitored.",10
"I like this movie. Powerfull movie for heart! You need to watch at least twice.

I like such movies that have a depth and make you search and find something in the depths of the soul.",10
"This movie is for sure one of the best ever made !!!

Actors are great, the story is great, so so much good movie...it's even IMDb's top-rated movie of all time - but did you know it almost had an entirely different cast behind those legendary bars?

Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.",10
"This is the one of my favorite movies so far. Deserves it place in the ranking. It's a masterpiece in every subject, the way it works, or the plot. Actors have played really well and you feel like you are in there until the end. It's like you're really in that prison and watching what happens from a third eye. If we are going to talk about the subject (I will review without spoilers.), ultimate story of friendship, hope and life. The wasted decades of an innocent man. But perhaps these years gave him a great friend for the rest of his life. After all that had been done to him, maybe he deserved to live a good life.

Whatever, if you are looking for a movie where you can spend your time well, this movie is so far the best. You won't waste your time, I promise.",10
"I can surely say that this is astonishing story that was shown by the director the most wonderful way.

Understand why its has been on the 1st place since a long time now here on IMDB.",8
It show us how you should never give even if the conditions are really worse. You just need to struggle hard. I really had no idea about this movie when I was going to watch it and thought that this might be another boring prison break movie. But as the movie progressed I took interest in it and watch it with moving an inch from my position. I'm glad I saw this masterpiece.,10
For me one of the best movie i have ever seen - good story and a nice end. Old but good! Thanks for this good Movie. Maybe a second Film is coming in the future ;),9
This is on of the best film I have ever watched. So I would like to recommend this one to other form all around the world. There is a real story that tech you how live and behave as well in critic situations.,10
"I've just watched this moving and memorable movie for the first time. I agree with others that it is right at the top of the pile of good movies and stories.

One small thing keeps plaguing my mind. When Andy crawls through his hidden tunnel, how did he get the poster of Raquel Welch back up on the wall to hide the hole?

And any ideas on how he could get a paper poster to attach to a prison wall back then (long before blue tack) and take it up and down frequently to dig the tunnel, without tearing, creasing or wearing out the poster? Maybe a fabric backing and hidden eyelets?

(I'm asking these questions just in case I need to design an escape route for myself in the future!)",10
"Writer and director Frank Darabont draws out strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as soulmates who support each other while doing hard time. Red sees hope as a dangerous thing that can drive a man insane, but Andy believes it is fuel that keeps one going against all odds. The Shawshank Redemption is a jubilant tribute to hope as an essential quality of soul.",10
"For all of you that have seen this movie Im sure will agree that this movie is the greatest of all time. I have three copies and I watch it about once a month. I never get sick of it, i could watch it every day and still not get sick of it. There is not a bad word i can say about it. I just cant believe it didn't win any awards. I think everyone who was involved in making this movie should be extremely proud of themselves. This is going to be very famous for a very long time. I have the most recent DVD copy of it and the special features are also amazing. I love watching the version of the movie where Frank is talking through it and explaining certain features as the movie rolls along. It is so interesting to learn all the behind the scenes info. I also love the feature where they show us the inside of the real prison. I cant believe how daggy it is and how small those cells are. It really makes you appreciate life and value all the positives and forget about all the negatives. It was great to hear from some of the former inmates and the warden of the prison. You can sense the emotion and eary feeling of the prison but they have had first hand experience and can tell you real stories of what happened there on a daily basis in real life. Again, Im just so passionate about this movie and recommend it to everyone, actually i don't recommend it I make people see it. I don't want anyone to miss out on the experience of viewing this movie so i make sure they see it. I have never heard a bad review. If any die-hard fans want to email me to discuss the brilliance of this movie, please feel free, it would be my absolute pleasure to talk about this wonderful film Amy",9
"I have never been impressed so much by any movie like I have been by "" the shawshank redemption "" This movie flows like a river. The further you get in the story the more it captures you emotionally and before you know it you are one with it. The story is about triumph of human spirit. Amazing..........WOW.

I proudly own a DVD copy of this movie and sure will be watching with my grand children. Although lot of people are are amazed that this movie didn't win an oscar, all I will say is this movie deserved beyond Oscar. An Oscar would have tried to imply that this movie is in class with the others, which it is not.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest prison drama I have ever seen. Brilliant performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and William Sadler. This movie is one of those movies I can watch over and over again.",7
"#2 out of 250... dnt get me wrong the movie is great, but I cant imagine how this movie is so well liked. sure it has a great story line, plot, and ending. everything a good movie needs. but it is all talk. every part is predictable. i knew right from the beginning that the one new cell mate who told Andy hes innocent was going to be shot and killed. yadayadayada was all i heard for the 2hr 30 min movie. i loved it, but expected a lot more after reading the comments before watching... i don't know why, but i just expected more from this film. i just felt that it culd have gone the extra mile and be deserving of the best film ever made.",9
"The most impressive movie and screenplay I've ever seen.

It will always remain a masterpiece.

Everyone knows the story. It is the escape struggle of someone who has been wrongfully arrested.",10
"If you analyze the breakdown of votes for each of the films 'The Shawshank Redemption' and 'The Godfather' it is evident that Shawshank scores higher than Godfather in almost every incidence.... except for the votes supplied by IMDb staff, whereupon there is a reversal.

Hmmmm.

Furthermore, and miraculously if you ask me, Godfather is 'voted' #1 film of all time.

By whom one wonders?

I think there should be a campaign to get The Shawshank Redemption rightly to the #1 spot. However, IMDb now sift thru the raw vote data and disregard the votes they don't want. They really are keen to keep The Godfather at the top.

I think it's pretty unfair myself. They have a load of schpeel about 'vote rigging' which they seem to ignore themselves.

Anyone got a plan? I have a Phd in Mathematics, it's a start.",9
A marvel of a movie. Something that many movies lack today. I do not know why current movies have lost that essence as good as the movies of the past were.,10
"Hi Friend I never See that type of Series. I Like That. It is master Piece. It is Full Of action. I love that the end of movie. Hero is so Awesome.

The Godfather's plot is slow and the pace of The Godfather is slow. However, neither these flaws are fatal flaws. The slow pace adds to The Godfather's elegiac qualities. The best thing about the plot is its unpredictable nature. You have no idea where it will take you next. At 18 I was unsure if I was old enough for this film to be appreciated or understood. But I am now able to fully appreciate it as the masterpiece that it is.",9
"In my opinion, the plot of the movie is quite tight, the connections are not interrupted, especially the sound is very suitable.

The author knows how to create a character for the character to live more alone in the corner of an experienced person. I don't think Frank Darabont has ever experienced that feeling like the main character.",10
"It is a great film because of the details that are used in the film. the thing about the story and the movie itself is it is told from Red's point of view making sure you know his opinion on it and what happened instead of having to figure it out on yourself. it, to this day is my favorite movie to watch and there will never be another movie like it in my opinion. the things that andy does go through hit you hard because you always see prisoners on TV but you never see an innocent man that you know is innocent going to jail for life. the friends he make are also very good additions that help the story and shows the corruptness of prisons in captain hadley nd the warden. there are a lot of memorable quotes in the movie also. such as ""get busy living or get busy dyin'"". the shawshank redemption shows the hardships people can go through when throws a curveball their way and how they deal with it.",10
"This is by far the best prison movie ever. The movie has everything a movie in this genre needs and it all blends together perfectly, a bit like the industry decided to release a ""best of"" record and this was the result. One of the movies greatest strength is it's balance; it doesn't deny the miserable conditions inside a prison while not taking advantage of it, and despite the sorrow it is nothing but a feel good movie.

Tim Robbins as well as Morgon Freeman are doing an excellent job portraying their characters and the prison environment is displayed with excellence. It is easy placing your self in that prison and it routines.

Despite my love for the movie I can't say I agree with it's #1 ranking on IMDb, but it most simply be due to the fact that people can't find anything they dislike about it.",10
"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.

He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and harika ve güzell.",9
"Good day, dear friends and dear readers of the reviews! I really want to write a review, of which a lot has already been written, but I can't resist) What an interesting film! MASTERPIECE!

This film deserves the highest ratings. This applies to absolutely everything. The plot, the play of the actors, the setting, and most importantly, the emotions that we get in the process of watching. I just could not tear myself away from the screen, rewound some moments to watch again. The film has very correct dialogues, even the correct silence, which speaks volumes. The tempo of the film suited me personally, it seems to be a leisurely and very detailed story, it fascinates me.

The film is instructive, makes you appreciate everything you have, you have to think a lot in the process. Such films are very well remembered the first time and you want to watch them periodically. With each viewing it becomes more and more interesting. If anyone else has not watched this movie, then I highly recommend watching it. I myself will review it until retirement, that's absolutely for sure!

Especially, even briefly, I will not talk about what this film is about, everything is clear from the title. Just take the time and see. I wish everyone a good mood and as many good pictures as possible! Thank you for the attention))",9

"An excellent masterpiece by IMDB time the highest votes and at the same time at the top of the rankings, the drama produced by a worldwide hit movie, the drama it creates is one of those good sequential movies that can be spent watching perfectly...I watched it when I was a kid and then I watched it a few more times, every time I watch it, my eyes fill with a pain in my heart. I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this beautiful film. I hope that in the 21st century, better films will be made by taking an example from such a film. I wish we can see much better movies like this.....",10
Just fantastic. This movie is really so wonderful i really enjoyed this and hope is they make another movie same like this i will must see. And just watching this movie again and again because i love it.,10
"This the best movie i have seen to date(and i must add that i have seen quite a few).

Its a piece of art...great direction,great acting,cinematography....such a piece is close to perfection.and how can one forget the story by Stephen King himself.

Its a story of friendship between two friends, a topic almost left untouched by Hollywood,though i can name a few in Bollywood....Sholay for example....but its just a outer covering. Beneath it lies the true essence of eternal hope. The hope to achieve freedom, the hope to surmount the jail walls to see the outside world,the hope to see a blue Pacific..

Its one of the greatest films of all times, and if you have still not seen it, then what are you waiting for,just go and enjoy it.. Its a piece of good work,and good things never die....

I hope you will see it....",10
"The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is a definitely a film worth seeing. In my opinion this movie is one of the best movies which was ever made. I would not say that it´s bound to be a box-office hit, because it was made at the same year as the smash hits such a Pulp fiction or Forest Gump. Regardless of not being so succesful as the two mentioned movies at Oscars, The Shawshank Redemption still occupies the first places of the lists of the best rated movies all over the world and, of course, it is certainly at the top of my list.",10
"I enjoyed this movie in fact it is on my favorite to watch list and my youtube channel. All of the actors were great and the director really caught me up with all of the action. If you have not yet watched this movie sit down get some popcorn and enjoy. Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex.",10
"I had resisted the temptation to see this movie for quite a while, even though it was recommended to me by many friends, and I was quite impressed by the high rating on IMDB. However, I have finally seen the movie now, and I can only say that I am very impressed.

I can only say that this movie is as flawless as any movie can be. It is amazing to me how a movie with barely any action can grip you like this one just through the story, the acting and the excellent character development. The characters are extremely real and believable, and it is easy to identify with Tim Robbins' character.

Tim Robbins was actually the biggest surprise for me in this movie, and this is by far the best performance I have seen of him. However, it seems that his acting style matches the material very well. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) should not be someone who is overly emotional, and this seems to be the perfect character for Tim Robbins.

However, the most moving performance in the movie came from James Whitmore. I will not spoil the movie by going into details, but even though his character's story is only a subplot, it is one of the strongest points of the whole movie, and his performance is absolutely memorable.

Still, with all the great performances, the star of this movie is its story. It is the story of someone who is objectively innocent when he goes to jail, and who loses a large part of his life in jail, but when he comes out of the jail, he is still a better person, because he has found his true self. The story proves that a person does not have to be guilty of a crime in the first place to find redemption, but that redemption can happen on many different levels.",9
It's crazy how Andy is so warm and compassionate and I admire him him that. His life principle is comparable to a noble man who doesn't give a shot to others who doesn't concern himself. He's straightforward and he knows what he wants and knows what he needs to achieve his wants.,9

"So many comments have reviewed, explained, praised and raised this movie to the greatest movie of all time. The story, acting, characters, cinematography, editing, script, everything is perfection... and that is an understatement. My rule is blue ray if the movies effects deserve it. This is the only exception. Go and buy this movie now. You deserve it and so does it deserves your time.",1
this is the best film that I have seen it is breathtaking the plot is excelent and the ending is magnificent,9
I watched the movie more than 10 times I can't stop it I don't know how many times I'll watch it again.,10
"Shawshank's life system is similar to today's social system. ""People have been demonized by the predecessors time and time again, but the narrative of painful narration is ""the way of salvation"" in front of the public. , The ""institutionalized"" people are accustomed to accepting it in order to be safe.",10
"It is not possible to understand for anyone who isn't victim or who was innocent in prison. But this is ever true freedom is the most blessing in life. Your soul will flutter every moment for standing on the side of a busy road, even for once. Or the place where you like to go most.

Still you are innocent.",6
"This movie just rocks, I really don't get it that some people think that movie is just for entertainment.

This movie is a lot more than entertainment, it has a deeper meaning that you got to see. It contains a lot of stuff to think about. - Innocent but decides to live with it - The dead of Brooks Hatlen - The decision of Red to follow Dufresne to Mexico

This movie has got 2 of the finest actors (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) in their line-up who play their bests parts untill now (that is what i believe).

This movie is just a must see",10
"Fantastic performances and cinematography, an all time favourite. Must see movie.",10
"It is not for nothing that this film occupies the first place in the rating. This is a real masterpiece, great acting, cool script. Probably, these days we won't even see something similar, or something that can even come close to the coolness of this film. I have watched this movie several times already, and every time I watch it with great pleasure. And what is most important - the film does not bore. It would be interesting to see the reaction of the audience to this film in 1994. In general, the films that were shot in those years are the best. I recommend this movie to everyone without exception. The best emotions you can get - this movie will bring.",9
"When the musical score alone is enough to broadcast the emotion of the movie, you know its a good film. Add to that outstanding performances and one of the best screen plays ever written and I promise you wont be disappointed.

Many people are surprised to learn that this film is based on a Stephen King novel, but they should not be. The dialog between characters is outstanding, and required a literary genius to construct. No one says to much or to little; it's just perfect.

Best line:

Andy: ""Why do they call you Red?"" Red: ""I think it's cause I'm Irish""

Red: ""These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.""

Red: Rehabilitated? Well, Now let me see. You know, I don't have the slightest idea what that means. parole board: Well, it means that you're ready to rejoin society. Red: I know what you think it means, sonny. To me it's just a made up word. A politician's word, so young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie, and have a job. What do you really want to know? Am I sorry for what I did?",9
"You cannot but feel a sense of unbridled joy when Andy stretches his arms out and feels the rain fall on his face the moment he is free. i own the DVD and i watch it at least once a month and i never fail to get chills on my neck on that scene.

once again: one of the most inspiring movies of all time.",10

Its good the quality is not great but i would love to watch k return of kings so i must write a review so i finish my porfile,10
"The Shawshank Redemption was photographed and completed on 35mm film. For this new 4K UHD release, Warner has gone back and scanned the original camera negative in 4K, creating a new 4K digital intermediate that is simply gorgeous and this HEVC-encoded 2160p transfer with HDR10 high dynamic range puts the previous Blu-ray and DVD releases to shame. Don't let the opening Warner logo fool you as it did me (it almost looks like a non-HDR logo was used), as once the movie begins, it is apparent that much care went into this transfer. First of all, the film's intended aspect ratio of 1.85:1 has been preserved (unlike previous releases that opened up the frame to 1.78:1). Detail is excellent, from facial features to the fine stitching in the fabrics of costumes. Highlights are excellently handled, appearing more natural where they appeared close to being blown out on the Blu-ray. Film grain is present and organic, but hardly noticeable (likely due to the scanning of the negative). Black levels are nice and deep, with strong shadow detail throughout. A big thank you to Robert Harris for helping me understand what I was seeing at the beginning of the film.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption film review What would you crawl through to be set free? Shawshank redemption is a spectacular movie full of excitement and it contains many dramatic scenes which have a very large impact on the atmosphere and the audience. The film is truly amazing as it will make you think about the geniuses that made the story. It will definitely leave you wanting to see it again and again. The story starts in court as Andy Duphrane, an ex-banker who is being convicted of killing his wife and her lover is being sentenced to two life sentences in prison.",10
"Freeman went for laughs in the buddy comedy Last Vegas (2013), in which he starred opposite Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, and Kevin Kline. He later voiced a wizard in The LEGO Movie (2014), a computer-animated adventure that featured renderings of LEGO toys as the characters and settings. His other roles in 2014 included an anti-artificial-intelligence activist in Transcendence and a psychology professor in Lucy. Freeman's later films included the comedies Ted 2 (2015); Going in Style (2017), a remake of the 1979 film about retirees who plan a bank heist; and Just Getting Started (2017), in which two rivals at a retirement community team up to save the woman of both their affections from her kidnappers.",10
Filmmaker - do a little research on the person who directed the piece. Is that person a controversial figure? Is he/she known for a political stance? Does the filmmaker have a significant background? Devote a paragraph or two to the person behind the movie and their other works in order to establish the significance of the film you are reviewing for the director's career.,10
"A ""life-affirming"" tale about life imprisonment, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is easily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations. This reverent adaptation of an unremarkable 1982 Stephen King novella was received tepidly at the box office--due in part to advertising that offered no clue as to what the movie was about--but gained a remarkably enthusiastic following and surprised many by netting seven Oscar nominations. In mid-1940s Maine, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is tried and convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison, where he meets affable lifer Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), whose applications for parole are turned down on an annual basis. Known as one who can get things--for a price--Red secures for Andy a pinup of Rita Hayworth and a rock hammer to pursue his geological hobbies. Both items turn out to be crucial parts of a scheme that the mild-mannered banker nurses through years of painstaking preparation. Whereas some Stephen King adapters have seemed intent on transcending or trashing their source material, writer-director Frank Darabont succeeds through fidelity to the text; the few deviations make this subdued male love story even more audience-friendly. The film benefits greatly from elegant cinematography by Roger Deakins and a poignant score by Thomas Newman. Freeman creates an endearing portrait of a decent man with a dark deed in his past, and Tim Robbins gives what may be his most accomplished portrayal. The excellent supporting cast includes James Whitmore, cute as the dickens as old-timer Brooks Hatlen, and William Sadler as a con who starts out scary and ends up lovable. Which brings us to the film's greatest limitation: prison hasn't looked this inviting since 1940s Hollywood. Nothing seems to build character like a long stint at Shawshank, which on the whole seems not much worse than a downmarket summer camp. This makes for a crowd-pleasing story that has little to do with the messy complexities of reality.",10
"Just awesome movie The Shawshank Redemption, I have ever seen. The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 drama film based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption from his novella collection Different Seasons.",10
"Any moment is a good time to see The Shawshank Redemption. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on one of the finest films ever made. The greatest part is that you'll like the film's pace, and you'll find yourself smiling at several times.",9
"This movie inspired me to never quit from a dark situation. I highly recommend everyone to watch this amazing the Shawshank Redemption movie. My friends also liked this movie a lot. In addition, i started my own production house after watching this amazing film.",9
"The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal film following the story of a man who was wrongly accused of murdering his wife and sentence to life in prison.

I highly suggest this movie to anyone, from a general audience to filmmakers.

If it weren't for Red, played by Morgan Freeman, I don't believe the protagonist, Andy would have made it through these brutal times.

In the ending, after being neglected a trial when it was proved he wasn't the murderer, he escapes by digging his way out of Shawshank prison.

This film is very suspenseful and inspirational! A must see for all.",10
"Great acting Great story educational and emotionally heart tugging.

Easy choice for a night of debate and deep thought on the structure of our society and why its important to vote for institutional change .

Story follows a couple men and their perspective on jail, when one finally gets out he's not the same man and he's scared because the outside world is harder in some ways then the inside.

The real question is what would you do if you were un employable, you had no family, no friends, no money after you got sent to jail for a crime you didn't commit or did.

See the problem with our societies structure now?

Definitely a Must watch.",10

I had to go to prison to learn to be a crook . :) :) :)",8
This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. From the acting to the story like. Morgan Freeman is one of the most under mentioned actors of all time. I dont feel like he gets the credit he deserves for the roles he's played over time. Good guy or bad guy. He makes you believe in all his movies.,10
"is an impressive, engrossing piece of film-making from director/screenwriter Frank Darabont who adapted horror master Stephen King's 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption (first published in Different Seasons) for his first feature film. The inspirational, life-affirming and uplifting, old-fashioned style Hollywood product (resembling The Birdman of Alcatraz (1962) and Cool Hand Luke (1967)) is a combination prison/dramatic film and character study. The popular film is abetted by the golden cinematography of Roger Deakins, a touching score by Thomas Newman, and a third imposing character - Maine's oppressive Shawshank State Prison (actually the transformed, condemned Mansfield Ohio Correctional Institution or State Reformatory).

Posters for the film illustrate the liberating, redemptive power of hope and the religious themes of freedom and resurrection, with the words: ""Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free."" Darabont's film is a patiently-told, allegorical tale (unfolding like a long-played, sometimes painstaking, persistent chess game) of friendship, patience, hope, survival, emancipation, and ultimate redemption and salvation by the time of the film's finale.

It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Actor (Morgan Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound - but it failed to win a single Oscar. And the film's director failed to receive a nomination for himself! In the same year as Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and Speed, they received all of the attention. Only through positive word-of-mouth (following cable TV and broadcast airings, and then video releases) did the film do well - although its original reception at the box-office was lukewarm. The film was the precursor for another inspirational and popular film (and a similar adaptation of a Stephen King story by writer/director Frank Darabont) - The Green Mile (1999)",6
"Wow.

I guess i would say is cool but a 90's movie?

Before im born in the late 2000s and 2010s started new things, cuz only in 2000s 2 years!??!

"The Shawshank Redemption is a film adaptation that came out 27 years ago, but is still one of the best to date. The film, which after so many years is still one of the best according to people's reviews, and also wins the audience's sympathy, and all thanks to the good play of the actors, because the main character Andy Dufrein, who finds himself in a difficult life situation, shows the core of a real person, one who is not gives up and continues to fight despite the unfair sentence.

Reading a book, it is not always possible to imagine a good picture in your imagination, and therefore sometimes you want to see a film in which the emotions of the actors will be fully conveyed, as well as everything that happens around them is precisely here and this is conveyed, which shows the superiority of the film over the book, despite the genius of Stephen King ...

The film is also relevant at the time of 2021 due to its plot, where the protagonist teaches how not to give up and it is necessary to achieve that very justice, because hundreds of people find themselves in a similar situation where the rules are not followed when passing a court verdict, as well as laws that seemingly spelled out in the legislation, including the presumption of innocence in Russia.

And in this case, the phrase is still relevant, both in life and in relation to the film: ""The most terrible tragedies led to the most important changes.""",10
This movie is good but not as 1st rank in IMDB it have an good story and real dram i did love it so i hope u enjoy it too like me :) i did really loved the morgan freeman act and also talking that was sooooo goood hope u enjoy the sound and act too.,6

"If you are in need of a feel good movie that speaks of redemption, kindness and leaves you with a happy pit in your stomach, watch Shawshank redemption. There is a Dufrene in all of us, but all of us have to be patient enough to let it out.",8
"It's truly one of the greatest films of all time.

An amazing story by Stephen king give a magnificent material for a talented director to create a masterpiece, each and every actor is a perfect fit for his rule, the soothing voice of Morgan freeman makes you feel as if you're living among them; suffering their hardships , enjoying their moments of happiness. Overall it's truly a masterpiece.",10
"10 stars. My number one top film since I first watched it 20 odd years ago, and still throughly enjoy it! I'm not sure what could come along and beat it.",10
"It is no big surprise that the film has such a high evaluating, it is plainly amazing. What would i be able to say that hasn't said previously? Very little, it's the story, the acting, the reason, however in particular, this film is regarding how it affects you. Now and then you watch a film, and can't recollect it days after the fact, this film loves with you, whenever you've seen it, you remember.

A definitive story of companionship, of trust, and of life, and conquering affliction.

I comprehend the reason why so many class this as the best film ever, it isn't mine, yet I get it. Assuming you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for quite a while, you really want to watch it, it's stunning.",10

"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It's an adaptation of the short story by Stephen King, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker sentenced to two life terms at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and lover. Andy struggles to live but finds comfort in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). As things start to pick up speed when the warden finds Andy a prison job more worthy of his banking skills. However, the arrival of another inmate will make a big difference for everyone.",7
"This movie teach us about consistent work. In this movie everything happen very smartly way bcause the main character is so smart.

This movie make great impact on our brain.",10
"It was a worth watching which binded me to watch it starting has a slow pace although speed up the story after intermisson. N the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.",10
"The movie is slow, but well worth a watch. Maybe even multiple if you're into the pace. Phenomenal acting and plot. The more you watch the film, the more ways you find to interpret the message.",9
"Excellent deserves to be at the top, I really enjoyed watching this movie, I am a person from Vietnam who loves to watch movies, I hope in the future we will have but good movies like this appear again great above all great.",10
"Outstanding performances of the two male protagonists. Heart-stringing plot arrangement. The conversion of the picture affects the hearts of the audience A breakthrough in film history, the whole film has no cold spots.",10
"Frank Darabont, writer and director of 'The Shawshank Redemption' has done a really good job with this movie. I have never read the Stephen King short story but I would imagine that it and the movie are pretty similar. First of all the screenplay is what contributes most to the movie. The relationship between Andy Dufresne, an eccentric loner, and 'Red', a popular and lively person, itself makes for an excellent story but with the prison environment and the other interesting charaters involved, the movie is even much better. This film is pretty much dominated by the characters. The movie takes place over about 20 years and in that time the film not only focuses on Andy and 'Red' but other characters that leave and arrive. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a character film. I've never thought that Tim Robbins has been a good actor but this does not bring down the movie. Morgan Freeman acts excellently as usual and William Sadler and Bob Gunton also give excellent performances. The cinematography and music for this film are also actually noticable.

The mood of 'The Shawshank Redemption' in my opinion has been created spot on. The movie balances well between lighter and darker incidents and after the movie was finished I had a feeling of satisfaction. The film is filled with many scenes that are a delight to watch and every different event that is emphasised in the movie are not only interesting elements of the film but also contributes to the overall movie, in that they change and effect Andy's feelings of his place in the Shawshank prison. I can't believe that this film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and didn't win any. If ever I had to say that a film was completely perfect, 'The Shawshank Redemption' would be it.",10
"I think it would be wrong to call this movie a normal movie because it has a life story beyond the movie, it's an amazing story and it is one of the best movies I've seen in my life, which should definitely be watched before you die. Definitely watch this movie, I don't know what else to say.",10
"I like the spirit of persistence.

This is a must see movie for men. That's what everyone says. But simply distinguishing between sexes will narrow the film. The whole story is almost filled with an incredibly warm tone, and the greatest theme in the film is ""Hope"".

Use wisdom, trust hope, and face fear bravely. Classic movies are classic because they all do the same thing,let you enjoy the beauty of hope from different angles.",10
There is always light end of the tunnel. Watch it whenever you feel disappointed.,10
"So many life lessons to be taught here. The synopsis is amazing and the plot twists are so very insane. Morgan Freeman is glorious!!! It's gritty, emotional, and endearing all at the same time. I loved it.

Hurry, run!! Watch this immediately.",9
Seeing Morgan Freeman among the cast made me interested. Seeing that the movie is over two hours long made me believe. Realizing that the movie is one (if not the best) of the best movies ever created made me emotional. This is a masterpiece and I find it hard to believe that there will be a movie that is hardly as good as this one.,10
No doubt 10/10. One of the best movies I've seen. Honored 1st place in TOP-250!,10
"Everything is great about this film, from the cinematography to the performances. Still shocked how Morgan Freeman didn't win Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role after his deep and flawless performance. But he won it 10 years later for Million Dollar Baby so no hard feelings.",6
"This film is nostalgia for me, its a timeless film that should be on everyones bucket list to watch before going to jail. Ive watched this film at least 8 times in my lifetime.",10
The movie is quite nice and fills the gap between the personal identification and your inner conscience and hence I loved the film and is a treat to watch this film. A must watch for everyone.,10
"Cinematic alchemy of a kind that's all too rare, propelled by a supremely talented cast, a sumptuous score by Thomas Newman and a first-rate script and direction from first-timer Frank Darabont. Unmarketable upon box office release, Darabount's masterpiece tanked and seemed destined to obscurity. Only after the video release, did 'Shawshawk' reap the praise it so richly deserved. Is it one of the greatest films ever made? Without a doubt, yes.",10
"One of the best movies out there, don't miss it. The characters are deep and complex, the story slowly builds as you discovered the friendship between the main characters. World beating performances by all the actors.",10
"A wonderful social drama, rightly included among the best films of the 20th century. Accountant Andy Dufresne, wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover, ends up in one of the most brutal prisons in Shawshank. There are cruel orders here. However, thanks to his lively mind, the prisoner achieves a special attitude towards himself both from other prisoners and from the administration. The film is about the fact that even in the most difficult situations, you can remain human and remain optimistic.",10
"Get busy with life or get busy with death The Shawshank Redemption is an adaptation of the novel by Stephen King. In my opinion, this is the rarest case when a film has surpassed the literary work on which it was created. And, despite the fact that it is always difficult to put a picture on the basis of a book, this is an example when the film not only perfectly conveyed the entire depth on the screen, ...",10
"Does it make sense to analyse this film like everyone else, using worn-out stamps like acting or composer's work? Needless to say, how the cameraman tried and wisely directed the filming? Hardly. This film impresses with its integrity - everything is in its place, ideal for each other. Each episode harmoniously complements the other, making the characters of the film not just living people, but people native.",10
"This movie is the best ever made in prison. It depicts one man's time in a big house for something he didn't do. That man is Andy Dusfren, played in his best movie by Tim Robbins. But he is not alone; a cellmate joins him. Red is also very well played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman talks about life in Shawshank until the end. Very catchy, showing what films are made of. Based on a Stephen King novel and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later will write and direct The Green Mile, another good prison movie that I still watch to this day!",10
"The first time I watched this film on TV, I was a schoolboy and did lessons for this film, lying on the floor of the weekend. Usually I meet some kind of 'chat' in the background so that it is not boring. I didn't really concentrate on elevated temperatures. But as now, I remember that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from the first minutes will entice me and let me postpone the lessons for a couple of hours. I just liked the atmosphere of the normal and the action that is seen on the screen. I didn't go into too much detail. Having rewatched it, already at a more conscious age, I just fell in love with this film. This is not just a popular and beautiful cinema, it is contemporary art, a philosophical work. I will say right away that I have not read the book, because I cannot compare. I rate an exceptional film.

The film is set in a child. It turned out to be a prison of this very special regime. The atmosphere, normal around, people - all this is very depressing. Anyone would break, but not our hero.

Andy Duferein is really not like everyone else, he is from a different text. Would be discovered, in such a simple and weak form with a person, lies so much strength, endurance and courage. In this lies, as for me, the main message of this work. Take heart, be strong, go to your goal without stopping, and you will have everything. Of course, Andy is a living person, he also experiences emotions, is afraid and worries. But his thoughts are not with us, they are perceived on purpose. The casual viewer does not immediately notice this. Dufresne is also strong in that he is one of those people who are not specially their faces, decent people, kind and decent people among those around them, no matter what. I think there is some strength in that too.

The moral is extremely simple, someone thinks that this film is about inner freedom, someone thinks that it is about friendship, and all this is correct. However, I believe that this film is about the boundless power of a person - about the inner core, the craving for the bright and noble. With such power, we are truly invulnerable. Go to your goal no matter what, without losing your nobility and sober mind.",10
"So much has been said about this film that you no longer know where to go, how to approach it. How to express your opinion about this film so as not to be one of many, and at the same time express some peculiar thoughts? In fact, it is as easy as it is difficult. Try to talk about what you feel, what associations or images arise while watching, but you never know by what theses or criteria you can intersect with someone else, so you have to maneuver, insert allegory. This is my favorite movie so far. It perfectly combines form and content. Get to know this film to understand whether you like it or not, because times change, attitudes towards films change, and this one is still watched with awe, maybe that's why it is still on top. I rate it with the highest score and highly recommend. This is a powerful movie that will not leave you indifferent. All health, kindness and good cinema!",9
"The whole atmosphere of the film is soaked through with injustice and cruelty. But in every dark kingdom there is a ray of light, here it is hope. A hope that won't let us go until we die. Whatever happens, we continue to hope for the best. And Thomas Newman, the composer of the film, managed to feel all this, convey the right atmosphere to the viewer. His music draws us into what is happening on the screen. And only with the onset of the credits, I bitterly acknowledged the fact that the film was over, and I would so like to know what will happen next...",10

"Its a great movie, would recommend it to everyone. The direction and cinematography is very well done and the acting is also mind blowing. I have seen the movie and taken many styling inputs and implemeted that in my work of line. Me being from the industry can note the level of details that went into making of thie movie.

It has been an all time favourite for me and my family to watch on reunions and festivals.

The story celebrates friendship, and empathy at the highest levels. Its a slice of life being depicted in cinematic form and executed beautifully in the best way.

Its a complete family drama to be seen.",10
"Perhaps, the excitement about The Shawshank Redemption, nominated in several Oscar nominations (alas, to no avail) and subsequently often included in all kinds of ratings of the best and favorite films, still cannot be explained only by passionate, contagious pathos, succinctly expressed in advertising slogan: ""Fear can make you a prisoner. Hope can set you free."" The finale is not only stunning, but, most importantly, makes you rethink the events on the screen, re-evaluate the actions and aspirations of the characters and the laws of life itself, reconstructed on the screen, capable, contrary to usual, to present very unexpected surprises.",10
"One of the best Film of all times, with gripping human connection throughout the twisting and turning plot. I found a lot of layers to the story, which moves the story in an ever tense and evolving situation. The visual play makes one be grateful for the freedom we all enjoy.",10
"Now I'm not much of a movie critic. I'm just a movie and tv show fan and Shawshank Redemption is something I think everyone needs to watch.

The cast is incredible and the chemistry between them all is unforgettable especially between Andy and Red.

The story is a simple one. A man is imprisoned and basically his life in prison of a long period. The movie has some great story beats and amazing plot twists.

Overall. Can't recommend enough. Everyone. Go and watch. Atleast once.",7

"Imagine that you are an ordinary law-abiding citizen. It will not be difficult for most of us to imagine this, since we are law-abiding citizens (if anything, I won't extradite it). It is also not difficult to imagine that you are married to a rather beautiful woman. There are some of us. Your wealth is above average, right? Do you live in the USA?

Yes, gradually this impromptu sociological survey narrows the circle; more and more people drop out of it: some do not have a wife, others have a prestigious job in a bank, others live in China, Uruguay or the village of Malye Gryazyuki. But the tragedy of Andrew Dufresne touches everyone.

Can it happen that under the influence of stress, intoxication and resentment, you use a weapon, pointing it at your beloved wife and her lover? After that, you can repent of the crime, you can imagine that all this is a dream, or you can try to deceive the investigation. One way or another, the first half of the film does not give a clear answer to the question: is Andy guilty? He may be a victim of circumstances, or he may be a cold-blooded maniac. But the judge has absolutely no doubts. His sentence is not severe, but cruel. Two life sentences in Shawshank Prison.

How would you feel? At first, the full horror of the situation does not reach you, there is hope that someone will stand in the courtroom and protect you, present some evidence of innocence ... but no. The bus with the same people as you is loaded to the eyeballs and goes to the hospitable monastery of convicts. Newcomers are welcomed with open arms (in every sense of the word), rarely let go, and for many, leaving a correctional facility is a tragedy only comparable to entering it. Tests begin immediately - when the prison gates swing open - and do not stop for a second. And when you enter the cell on stiff legs, you understand that now this is your home. And you have plenty of time to think about how you got here. Despair, you say? Oh yeah! And only a few not only think about how they got here and put up with it, but also think about how to get out of here. Preferably until the end of the sentence. This is Andy Dufresne.

How many films have we seen where the setting was a prison? It seems that there is nothing more to say in this topic - pain, trials, hopelessness, longing for freedom, for relatives and friends, male friendship, enmity, cruel guards ... - a standard set. But King's adaptation is taking its toll. The hero is weak. He does not have a mountain of muscles to survive in prison, like the heroes of some Stallone and Van Damme. He has no influential acquaintances. He has no one outside the prison walls at all. Everything he had was taken away. First on the killer of his wife, then on the verdict of the court.

Andy, that tall, stooping banker, couldn't survive in prison. Shouldn't have. But against all laws and theories of probability, he began to fight for his life. The strongest spirit was imprisoned in this clumsy weak body. So strong that the confines of the prison could not hold him forever. Did he think about running away from the very beginning? Unlikely. He just fought for his life, throwing small brushwood into the weakening fire of hope.

Hopelessness manifests itself in the simplest, but extremely effective ways. A voice-over informs that five years have already passed ... ten ... fifteen ... and in the life of prisoners everything goes on as usual, only the beauties on the posters in the cell replace each other. Time cuts you like a sharp razor. How can you keep hope for so long? Is it even possible? How is unknown, but what is possible, Andy proved. Despite the attacks of the head of the prison and other prisoners, despite the fact that no one believed in him.

Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a person crazy. (c) Red

How can you talk about a movie like The Shawshank Redemption? Any words will not be enough. Here and friendship, and survival, and questions about justice, willpower and the meaning of life. What is freedom? Can a prisoner feel the wind of freedom, and a free person languish in the conclusion of the stereotypes of life? Freedom is an ephemeral concept. If you are free to go anywhere, but still go to your boring job every day, and this will continue until retirement, are you free? Hardly. Only by earning freedom can one learn to appreciate it. And only then you will feel its true taste. And a prison can become an excellent school for survival ... or maybe life?

The prison in Escape is the whole world. There is a Leader here, there is an army, there is a handful of rebels, but most of this world consists of a gray mass of hopeless inhabitants. This is what makes them so gray, identical and not at all shabby prison uniforms.

The film does not provide answers to the questions ""Why do we live?"" and ""How to live?"". He just puts them right. So after watching, I want to scroll through all these events in my head again and think. Despite the gloomy surroundings of the picture, it evokes only bright feelings. And for this paradox alone, I want to applaud.

Does it make sense to analyze this film, like all the others, using hackneyed clichés like acting or composing? Do I need to say how hard the cameraman tried and how wisely the director managed the shooting? Hardly. This film is striking in its integrity - everything is in its place, ideally suited to each other. Each episode harmoniously complements the other, making the characters of the film not just living people, but family people. When the film ends, its magic is still working on the viewer. The history of Man remains in his soul. The aftertaste is like a glass of aged red wine, slightly tart, but still sweet. Unlike most ""prison movies"" (that's what many disrespectfully call ""Escape...""), this aftertaste lasts surprisingly long. And even years later, remembering the final scene, you will be sure that there is no happier person in the world than Andy Dufresne.

Hope is the best thing in the world. She doesn't let us die. (c) Andy.

Keep your ""tens"" and other marks with you. The rating scale for this film has not yet been invented. If cinema could be compared to a winery, then I would say about Darabont's film that you don't want to drink this bottle, but to drink it.",10
"Some birds aren't meant to be caged.

The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10.",10
"The first time I watched this movie on TV, I was a schoolboy and did lessons for this movie, lying on the floor at the weekend. I usually turned on some kind of ""chatterbox"" in the background so that it wouldn't be boring. I wasn't really concentrating on what was happening. But as now, I remember that the ""Shawshank Escape"" from the first minutes lured me and forced me to postpone lessons for a couple of hours. Then I just liked the atmosphere of what was happening and the actions that take place on the screen. I didn't go into much detail. After reviewing, already at a more conscious age, I just fell in love with this film. This is not just a popular and beautiful movie, it is a real art, a philosophical work. I must say right away, I haven't read the book, so I can't compare it. I evaluate the film exclusively.",9
"Great movie. He kept the main character in suspense throughout the episode. The emphasis of the film is on willpower and a great desire to achieve its goal, for which thanks to the author. Incredible performance of the best Hollywood actors.

One of my favorite movies, I advise you to watch 100%",10
"It was a great and perfect movie. I personally fell in love with it. I definitely recommend you to watch it. It is one of the movies that is unique.

"Haven't seen anything better than this movie. The most touching, beautiful, a little dark, smart and with a perfect ending, showing that good always wins. Recommend a must-see!",10
"With enough hype and investment, a weak film can top the charts and break the records.

But, ask real people how they feel about this film and you will find a genuine majority of awe - from a population that found the film by being told to watch it by the most trusted of authorities - our mates.

This film is hope and love, carried in a vehicle of misery, struggle and achievement.

It is relentlessly thought provoking.

The soundtrack is as powerful as subtle, and like the film, can summon tears without warning.

The best in this one cannot be read about. Enough said.",4
"There's no doubting that this is a fantastic film. The acting is excellent, and the tale is compelling.

Personally, I think it's a touch too long and syrupy for my tastes, but it's not a horrible movie.

On the other hand, I'm still perplexed as to why this film received so many Oscar nominations and why so many people have fallen in love with it. It has to be the product of varied tastes to put it on the same level as The Godfather and hundreds of other films.

This is a movie that should be viewed because it is good, not because it is exceptional.",10
"Originally the film didn't work out well when it had released, it's the highest rated here on IMDB and is worth watching. It is one of the best movies with a satisfied endings as well.",10
"This movie is by far my personal favorite film of ALL TIME!!! It is a classic and will always hold up over the generations. Adapted from a novel by Stephen King, this film tells a story through amazing direction, acting and writing. The Shawshank Redemption will suck you in and feed on almost every emotion you have, then spit you out wanting more. The next best movie to this would probably be The Green Mile (also adapted from a Stephen King novel). I should probably write a longer and more eloquent review, but you will just have to trust me and watch this one. I NEVER watch a film more than once, maybe twice. I have seen this one over 20 TIMES!!! Do yourself a favor and get hooked on it like I did! You won't regret it ;-)

"I can't seem to be able to find my copy of Different Seasons. Can anyone tell me the correct spelling of the town they end up in? Maybe you could e-mail me at vjohnson18@cinci.rr.com with Stephen King in the subject line. Thanks Victor. Also,how can anyone say this was a bad movie? You don't get nominated for Academy awards on the strength of bad acting. The movie is set of course in the forties to start.In that time period most everyone's mannerisms with each other are very formal and polite. I believe the movie hit that right on the spot. That's why I don't understand how someone thinks there is so much overacting. If you want to see overacting watch just about everything that David Caruso has ever been in most notably Csi Miami.He's the only negative thing in that trilogy. Overacting in Shawshank,I can't imagine where this guy's head was at or what he was expecting to get from this movie. He probably thinks the Count of Monte Cristo was a flop too, where like Shawshank the best parts of the movie were the deep conversations, and interactions to each other based on the complete range of human emotions. The intense circumstances of the various subplots of both movies can't help but bring about the most powerful depiction of emotions that the human heart can muster. When a movie shows this and can also make you feel what the characters feel that's a good movie. When a movie covers all the emotions,character buildups and a plot that keeps you riveted in your seat and You wouldn't know it if the theater was on fire, that's not just a good movie it's great. Sorry but if you can't get that maybe you ought to stay with something easier like cartoons.",10
"This is the best movie I've ever seen, and I don't understand why in 21th century film producers can't make another movie like this, or more like this.",8
The fact that this movie is one of the greatest works of all time is the good side of movies productions in the 90' And how the performances of every single actor and how they nailed their roles is just brilliant and how they can make you emotional and to the point that you'll never get bored of the movie.,8
I like it. It is one of my favorite movies. The characters are interesting and the message is very sentimental. No wonder why it is one of the top 250.,9
"I remember reading Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption as one of four stories in a Stephen King's ""Different Seasons."" I was captured by the book and was thrilled to see it on the screen afterwards. A compassionate telling of passage through the muck and evil of an imperfect justice system. Brilliantly executed. This story will always be remembered.",10

OMG! This is really very good movie. Watch again...,10
"I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!

Why? This was my question.

The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).

The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.",10
Classic movie. The cast is what makes the title. What on a Friday night Saturday night or any night for thrills and spills. All inspiring story of perseverance.,10
"This is it.

The film has it all. Superb actors, even better screenplay, fabulous redemptive conclusion and believe me when I insist with all of that said they did not forget the entertain.",8
"A movie made 25 years ago and say there has been nothing better since, but it is true. The storytelling and the production and the acting and the morality and the good guys and the bad guys and the hope it conveys..., But seeing this in 2021 (again) I have to say the praise is justified.

There is just something about Shawshank Redemption.",10
"This film is fantastic. It was made before 25 years ago, but watching it again in 2021 felt amazing. It's strange to evaluate a movie produced 25 years ago and declare there has been nothing finer since, but it's true. The tale, the production, the performances, the morals, the good folks and bad ones, and the optimism it communicates, But, after viewing this in 2021 (again), I have to agree the acclaim is well-deserved.

Do you want to know something incredible? Examine the director's credits. He's not interested in making a quick buck, is he?",10
I was in awe with the Acting skills of Morgan Freeman! Loved it. Jail scenes seemed to be too realistic though I live outside America. The pain of the prisoners was there! The end of the movie showed the friendship.,10
The film that I've recently seen is the terminal it's very good and creative and above all it's based on true story it's about a man that goes to America and while he was on the plane his country got on a civil war and his passport turned not usefuel and he can't get in Ameruca so he lives in the airport and work to eat and I don't want to tell you much about it so go watch it.,9
"If you do not see this movie, you have wasted your whole life in the cinema.

Such a good movie. Which keeps me excited while watching this movie. The character of the movie is so real. I Love this kind of movie. The narration of the movie is so good.,9
Hollywood has done very few movies since perhaps watchmen...) so grab this one if you have not watched it. It is just so well acted. You believe it all and want more of every single character!,10

"Yes, it does deviate from the short a little with character changes and omissions, but I don't think this film could have been any better. I am in line with the ten-star reviews that I'm seeing and the only reason I am not giving this parable for hope a ten myself is because I don't as a rule. Hope, aspiration, fighting the system, justice and humanism against the tyranny of the mainstream society/religion. This is the film.",10
"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.

Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.

One of the best movies I saw!!!!",10
"One of the best movies of all time. Great actors, story and a great pacing, that allways makes the film intersting and fascinating. Morgen Freeman showed ones again why he is such a great actor.

So you must see it.

One of the best moments of the movie when they were drinking some cans.",10

One of the unforgettables of my movie archive. I guess i watch it once in a year. It's fantastic no doubt! Regards to director Frank Darabont and to all cast!,10
"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).

Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.",10
Awesome storyline. I just shocked watch this movies. Just a masterpiece movie. Awesome storyline. I just shocked watch this movies. Just a masterpiece movie.,5
"This is considered one of the best films of all time, and with good reason, it is one of the few films that are unique with characteristics that only it has, a narrative thrilling that is told by Morgan Freeman.

A protagonist (Tim Robbins) who with his unique performance makes us feel his emotions and pain while the protagonists are wonderful, Red (Morgan Freeman) is one of the greatest characters ever more in-depth in history just like Tim Robbins,with one of the best acting and friendship duos of all time, showing the true meaning of friendship and redemption, this movie shows that it's worth knowing the seventh art with a unique movie that will never do anything as good as it is and one of the most remembered, memorable, referenced and best movies ever made, MY FAVORITE MOVIE and the best movie ever made.",10
Good. Fanatastic truly amazing worth it. This is really simple movie and fantastic job ever perfect. I hope next time we'll see better one any other suggested?,7
"I think it's just an excellent film with an amazing storyline. From the first minutes of the film, you dive headlong into the history of the film adaptation. An amazing story about Andy Dufresne, an accountant who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then tries to win over the prisoners and guards. I believe that this film is 100% worthy of your attention. Thanks to Frank Darabont for this masterpiece :)",5

"One of the best. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.",9

Absolutely outstanding performance by tim robbins and morgan freeman. I always enjoy watching them. The film has everything it takes for a sophisticated movie night.,10
The most overrated movie ever. A classic? Yes. A masterpiece? Maybe. Best movie ever? Hell no.,10
"Really captivated me for the rest of the movie. The actors played it very well. I felt the every single one of them had a previous life, that they lived before entering the prison and it really kept me watching it.",8
"Favorite movie ever? No, but phenomenal movie? Yes. It's a classic for a reason. Phenomenal performances, pacing, visuals, characters, story , and the ending is amazing.",10
"This is a stunning and iconic painting. She talks about so many things at once and in such simple, non-metaphorical, sometimes even cruel language. I can't even believe that so much can be put into one picture. A great help for Darabont was the story of his close friend, Stephen King, which looks much weaker against the background of the film adaptation. The director was able to use visual language to tell this story about friendship, social inequality, love, perseverance, courage as touchingly and correctly as possible. And about the main theme of 'The Shawshank Redemption' - hope.",10
"Ist a Great Movie

books, the book is always better. How can it not be? You get way more detail than could be crammed into a two-hour movie. However, I still thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation.

"The film's meticulous attention to detail is evident in its masterful cinematography, which perfectly captures the contrasting emotions of despair and hope. The bleakness of prison life is juxtaposed against the breathtaking landscapes and moments of liberation, accentuating the film's overarching themes. Through thought-provoking dialogue and remarkable performances by the entire ensemble cast, including Morgan Freeman's portrayal of Red, a seasoned inmate and Andy's confidant, the film deftly examines the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity. A timeless gem in the world of cinema.",9
"I think a lot has been said about this movie and it deserves its cult following that it earned years ago. For me I watched it around a year and a half ago and it has still followed me since. It piqued my interest for movies overall which led me to some of the greats like Kurosawa, Tarantino, Kubrick, Wells, Ford, Scorsese, Ray, and many more. While movies like Seven Samurai come close to being my favorite, Shawshank is still superior in my eyes based on a couple of factors. One is that it is mainstream art which is actually more uncommon to get than the movies that feel too ""artsy"" or on the opposite side of latter where movies feel too shallow. Because it feels mainstream enough, I feel like in part it's able to ground itself and create a more genuine feel with its characters and the prison itself. Granted of course Andy's willpower is something you'll rarely come across in people but we feel it being well established as we see his ups and downs in the story. Reasons like this to paint him as a strong hearted person who can handle the harsh conditions of prison and feel human with emotionally is what makes him my personal favorite character even though Red is the fan favorite. Speaking of Red though I cannot deny Morgan Freeman's narration was nothing less than stellar as we get to see the movie through his lens and it's because we see how Red is affected by Andy. I think another thing people don't talk too much about is the more subtle themes Shawshank has. People obviously know hope is the largest theme which is beautifully done in poignant yet uplifting manner. However, I feel like friendship gives this undertone to the theme of hope that makes it more powerful. I loved all the interactions between the prisoners. They all feel real and human. Andy and Red in particular build this friendship that feels authentic and captivates the audience with looking at one of the positives that keeps these people going in prison. It makes the beach scene all the more satisfying because it fulfills that theme of friendship making the ending amazing and one that doesn't leave you for days.",10
"This is a movie I could watch over and over. Good prison movie. I love Morgan Freeman, so choosing to watch this film was a no brainer. I didn't miss a second of the movie.",10
"Probably the best Stephen King film adaption ever, but you don't have to be a King fan to enjoy this awesome movie. The plot centers around the (wrongful?) incarceration of Maine banker Andy Dufresne(excellently portrayed by Tim Robbins) after being convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover. However, the film (AND story....read it) go beyond that and detail the cruel, corrupt inner workings of the prison, the emotional and mental state of the inmate, and the conflict of inner bars versus outer ones. The supporting cast is also uncommonly good, led by heavyweight character-actor Morgan Freeman as the veteran con ""get-it-guy"" Red. With moments of brutality, beauty, humor, and an unexpected twist, The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the best films in recent cinematic history.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! 1994 best movie watched so many time i missed the counting.",10

"In life we are all challenged with gross injustices. To some it may be being passed over for a promotion, or to others it may be something as trivial as being served the wrong plate at a restaurant. How we deal with those injustices shape our lives or end our lives. In Shawshank we see how one man is dealt with one of the largest injustices known to man, and accepts the injustice. He never asks for sympathy, for he believes in a way he deserves his fate. However, when the new world that he enters deals him a new hand of unfairness, our man once again accepts the misdeeds that are dealt him. The irony of the story is the only illegal thing that our man Andy does is what sets him free and redeems his life.",10

It is a testament to the power of cinema and its ability to inspire, move, and uplift audiences.",10
"This movie is so much more than what one would make out of it by simply looking at actors, director and plot outline. Its the synergy of all these parts that makes it one of the greatest of all time. TSR is a metaphor for all the important questions in life. The limits we set on ourselves, the ease of falling into conformity and our fear to hope for the best for our self's. The movie is about hope, in times of struggle, in times of extreme hardships and injustices, its about enduring and crawling trough all this s*** and seek the redemption outside in the soft rain from heaven. Its simply a ""to be, or not to be"". I could write cheesy metaphors all night but I'm gonna stop now. I love this movie simply because it gives me hope, its helped me trough my life's hardships, heartbreak and injustice, its helped me to get trough these times and made me love life more than life itself.",10
Best of the Best. The best movie I've ever seen. It cannot be more entertaining. Excellent performance. Once a year I happen to see this movie and never gets old. The actors deliver their best of the careers.,9
"This film was one of the most well known american films and has become an icon for film and tv. There are references in the cartoon ""Spongebob Squarepants"", that is how popular the film has been over 28 years.",10

"Just a great movie.

When I watched this movie, there were moments when I questioned life. The acting is amazing, the movie is amazing. No need for further extension. It's obvious why it's in the first place.",10
"a creative mind can outsmart any system

This masterpiece is timeless. The main character is convicted to life in prison. Falsely accused, but newer gets justice. Instead of fighting the justice system, he uses it against itself - in a clever way. He brings a man to justice through he's own salvation.

The warden represents the no-mercy system. Andy represents the citizen. David vs. Goliath. But David needs friends. You can't beat the system without friends.

Traditionally the main character must save or change the world - in a big or small way. Andy digs he's way out of the system, leaving the warden to the system, and changes the way prisons were run.

Love to see it over and over again..",10
"I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.

The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the sou.",6

"No long summary here. It's about two guys in prison, that probably don't belong there, that have lots of time to reflect on life. You will like them. The characters are deep. They will remind you of real people. You will feel richer as a person after seeing this movie. It's inspirational, philosophical, yet doesn't preach. Beautifully filmed, acted, and directed. It doesn't get much better than this.",9

"Amazing movie, the magic of cinema.

The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.

Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.

""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",10
"This is by far my favorite film, if not the best ever made. The direction and acting is beyond description, to the point where it could have been a silent film and we still would have known what was going on. A most triumphant start to a career for Frank Darabont, who has taken Stephen King's novella of about a hundred pages and made it into a masterpiece. It's about time a website ranked this movie towards its top, because that's exactly where it deserves to be. 10/10.",6
"Great movie. Everyone should watch this movie. This movie teach us that Life is to much challenging with hardship and struggle but with your intelligence with patience and put trust on God, you can overcome any situation and challenges and at the end you get success.",10
The best i ever seen. Litteraly its the best film ever for good the scene the story the caracters and also the story you made my day you guys appreciate the hatd work ay this masterpiece.,8
"It is a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life.

This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us.",9
"It was one of the best movie I've ever seen.

""Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are better left unsaid""-that was a beautiful line.

""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.

And no good thing ever dies!"" And I got hope from this movie again..

""These walls are funny. First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, you get so you depend on them. That's institutionalized.""- Most of the lines of this movie was so much realistic.

I have found happiness while watching this movie.

I got inspiration. I've watched so many times, but never felt any boring.

"Verdict: A tad depressing and kind of bigoted against Christians, but overall a good film. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go.",10
"Best Cinematography i have ever seen. I know everyone have a taste his self. But for me, this is the best cinematography. Beside that, i also like the story.",6
"Classic, Only description would be ""Add to Must watch list"" it's always great to turn back and watch it again!!!! Great acting mixed with great production.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy.",10
"Im really like this movie, rich story. A banker who is sentenced to two life sentences. At shawshank state prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover.",10
I Think This Is Very Good Because I Am Addicted To This And It Is A Very Good Movie.

OMG It Was So Good I Can't Stop Watching The Movie.,10
The movies was outstanding. I loved the way scripts were written and how the plot turns around. It made me think how relationship are built with understanding. It was pure magic. What a brilliant movie that was! It had everything I could possibly want out of a big production like that.,10
"I love this movie. This is very interesting . The film has been interpreted as being grounded in Christian mysticism. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the Last Supper, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the ""lords of all creation"" invoking Jesus' blessing. Director Frank Darabont responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. The discovery of The Marriage of Figaro record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the Holy Grail, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds .also like this movie shorturl.at/chzV9.",9

"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not just a movie, it's an experience. From the opening scene to the final shot, it immerses you in its world, making you feel like you're a part of the story. The film's themes of hope, friendship, and redemption are beautifully woven together with exceptional performances from the cast, particularly Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. What makes this movie truly stand out is its ability to make you feel a range of emotions, from joy to sorrow, and everything in between. It's a movie that stays with you long after the credits roll, and one that you'll want to revisit time and time again. Overall, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a cinematic triumph that deserves all the praise it has received over the years.",10
"I appreciated what you have done with your movie sir, thanks alot !!

I am excited about your next project sir. Keep it up.

The only reason why i give this for 6 star is your movie is so touching.",10
"This story has such an awesome effect on those who watch it! This movie leaves you reading the credits with that ""feel good"" feeling deep inside you. Timm Robins and Morgan Freeman absolutely steal the show with their amazing friendship. I give this movie five stars, two thumbs up, and one heck of a high-five!!

This movie proves that you do not need to pump a movie full of action scenes, romance, and comedy in order to wind up with a great film in the end. This movie is by far one of the greatest films that i have seen in a long time and i was excited to find out that i would be able to voice my opinion with leaving a comment like this!",10
I watched this Movie with my friends and we really enjoyed it. I have to say this movie still worth watching in 2022. Out class acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.,10

"Wistfull7 April 2022 Decent entertainment, somewhat memorable. Why this is seen as such an incredible, sensational work of art is beyond me... I feel like this is one of the few crime-thriller-prison-action related films that met my expectations, as in, was A Good Film, but that alone doesn't make it a classic.",7
"It was a great movie.it was more fun than i thought.i was thinking that it'll be a movie like the movies are released before but it just amazed me for the first time.

I was thinking that they can like such realistic roles like that's not a movie .they were performing there role like a man perform his real life.

At the end i'll only say that the director and all the cast did it well and excellent.it was very realistic .just salute to all cast , director, producer and all others that are included in this cast.

Now i want that they will release a movie again like this and i am waiting for that moment .",10
"This Movie Is True Perfection, If You Haven't Watched It Stop Doing What You Doing Right Now And Watch It. The Ending Was Perfection, And Red And Andy Are Both Such Good Characters. The Plot Is Amazing And It The Most Ejoyable Movie I Have Ever Seen, And I Truly Belive That This Movie Is Immposible To Dislike.",10
"This movie has everything that makes for a lifelong memory. Many twists and turns in a very well told story with many dynamic story lines moving along the entire duration of this film.

Probably the best prison movie of all time with entertainment throughout. No other movie set in a penitentiary has this type of story or plot.

Excellent performances by all actors making this an incredible film on many levels. A must see masterpiece!!!

If memory serves this was best picture for a reason. The John Coffey character is unforgettable along with all the other actors each playing their roles perfectly.

Super heavy ending making this film surprise you..",10

It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",10
"The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever.",9
"When I first saw the description for this, seemed boring.

Lord, how was I wrong.

Something in this woke something inside me, I literelly could not believe I've spent my life this far without having seen it.

Felt like the 2 hours passed in 30 minutes and while I was watching, I hoped it would never end.

In this movie, you will cry, you get deeply angry, you feel genuine happiness and feel genuine peace. It feels like an entire life in which in the end you are proud of everything you did and conquered.

The best movie ever made, wonderful.",10
"Never forget the impact of this film in my life when I was a teenage and how the story, acting and directing made me more in love with the cinema! Unfortunately, we don't have chance to see such these films nowadays specially in Hollywood and this is so sad.",10

Up there with the small handful of 'greatest movies of all time'.",10
"Simply a great movie. In my life it always takes the first 3 places out of 10 movies. I would definitely recommend everyone to watch it. After watching it, you watch it over and over again. This is my third viewing and it felt like the first time.",10
"Nowadays it is very difficult to see old films, especially the Shawshank Redemption film which has an interesting storyline and production, but when I saw this film in 2022 it was still good to watch.",10
"""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.

Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.",10
"Everything that happened in this movie happened for a reason, literally every single thing. The whole time I watched this movie it had my full focus. The plot twist was perfectly timed and the ending wasn't stretched out.

This movie has an intresting viewpoint as where the prisoners are the so called ""good guys"" except a few of them but eventually they get what they deserve coming for them.

The ending is just perfect because you think you knew the perfect ending but in fact you didn't. I'd highly recommend to watch this movie with someone or alone either way it's truly a masterpiece and a once in a generation movie!",10
"Finally! For the second time in a week this movie is back to No. 2 where it is rightly placed, second to the Godfather. Thanks to everybody who voted to bring it back. I just wish it will stay there.

It was very awful seeing this movie ranked behind just one of LOR films. What is even worse is that the only movie that collected more votes than Shawshank Redemption is LOR1. I hope that will not be the case one day. If it is the Godfather, we would 've lived with it, but some times it is difficult to understand these IMDb users' votes.

I wont add any other comments to what people already mentioned. I just want to say that if you haven't yet seen this movie, then you don't know what you are missing.

10/10",9
"This movie was awesome from start to finish. Easily one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. A tough, complex story. In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding. A masterclass in pretty much every category. Well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax!",10

Must watch film, that is just as fantastic every time to watch.",10
"Shawshank is a movie which somehow trancends the whole of its parts. In all respects, this is a movie that has no right to work as well as it does. There are so many opertunities where a director and a cast of lesser instincts could have delved into schmatlz, yet the ensemble remains steadfast as the story unwinds. Make no mistake, this an uplifting tale which uses the ubiquitous happy ""Hollywood"" ending. Not only does it take place in the forties, it also seems that the movie itself was a product of the studio era of Hollywood cinema, with a plot and pathos that would have worked in the best of Capra's films. Shawshank, as a result, requires us to check the most ""nintees"" of all mindsets in the process, cynicsm. Shawshank is all about faith in the human spirit and freedom, and how both are impossible to lose as long as you beleive in yourself -- Not exactly a bromide for present day society. That this movie remains popular is evidence that we still thirst for Capra-esque movies that shy away from cynicsm.

Shawshank , unlike most modern films, wears no self-aggrandizing snear. It proudly wears earnestness and faith, while other movies try to mock such feelings. Is Shawshank the most intelligent movie around? No, certainly not. Is it the most philosphically groundbreaking? Not at all. Will it change the face of movies? I don't see it as likely. Instead Shawshank is a timeless piece whose story will leave it's mark on those who approach it with an open mind. It won't change your life, but it will make you walk higher, look farther, and hope harder that such a story can exist is a world where so few tales of redemption come without a snear.",8
"Great movie not much else to it.

Great storyline from top to finish. Begins with a lot of information but makes more sense the further one gets into watching it.",10
I saw this movie almost hundreds times and this movies surprised me every time . The bitter fact of life written by the most celebrated writer and captured by the awful diractor. I suggest this movie toevery new commer and every vetiran . One must see this movie almost ten time in his life otherwise you are living the life of a blind.,10
"It probably wasn't as clear to many, back in 1994, how great the movie is. During my own first viewing of the film (which must have been back in 2008), I enjoyed it a lot, and moved on. But it began to loom so tall in my memory then when I revisited it, I was stunned by how much better it is on repeated viewings. If you haven't watched yet go and watch.",9
"This movie will surely touch your heart. Watched this film on a DVD. Once the movie gets started, you cannot take yourself away from it.

Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.",6

"This film was released in 1994. The lead roles of the movie, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, were amazing. It type is drama and the duration of the movie is almost 2 and a half hours. It was directed by Frank Darabont who I have never heard his name.

This movie is about a man's fight against injustice. Andy Dufresne is a young, succesful and very clever banker whose wife was murdered. After investigations, he was shown as murderer and he was sent to jail. And the rest of the movie is about his extraordinary life in jail. How the movie was proceed is a masterpiece with its settlement, acting and soundtracks are excellent as well for its audience, 2:30 will last as if a second.

This movie must be watched before you die. Accordig to IMDB users it is one of the top 3 movies in the history. I felt many feelings during the movie. It can make you feel a lot of complex feelings at the same time. I felt sad, happy, hopeful or hopeless but i felt impressed.",10
This is a 9/10 hour movie and sometimes these days it's difficult for me to stick with the longer movies but this never felt long. You were always curious what was going on. Let's just say it didn't quite go the way I expected but I was intrigued the whole time. The acting was great. This could for sure be considered a slow burn and I'm actually currently watching the TV show Sharp Objects by the same author and this is paced much better than that. There's a couple things I didn't particularly thing got solved or like how they went at the end but overall a great movie.,9
"A beautiful film, one of my top 10. When I find myself in difficult situation, then I think about this film, and I find inspiration to carry on and to do my best to get better.",10
Its indeed a great movie. I have been suggested by someone to watch this movie. A great direction and great end. The most thrilling part was the way he escaped from the jail.,10
"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best all-round movies of all time. The story is powerful in that it represents real issues in society, not petty ones that a lot of movies nowadays base their stories off of, that are usually unrealistic anyways. The characters are interesting and have strong character arcs, and the highs and lows are extreme highs and lows, there's not doubt you'll be moved by this story. And to top it all off the acting is well executed, believable, and entertaining. It raised the bar for movies for ever. If you haven't seen this movie yet I'd say it is a ""must see movie"" in my books. Do not hesitate to give it a couple hours of your time, you will not be disappointed.",10

"Different people may have different feelings when watching the same film. For me, who is unable to change the status quo at present, the deepest feeling after watching this film is that talent and perseverance are the best way for anyone to get freedom under any circumstances.

The young banker in the film, with his mastery of bank financial knowledge, not only won his own safety and a little freedom in prison, but also won material and spiritual benefits for his cellmates. It is also because of his mastery of finance that the hero finally completely defeated the cruel and sinister warden and made himself gain material freedom.

On the other hand, look at the unremitting application letters every week for six years, the two application letters every week for N years, the tunnels dug day by day with the stone axe that ""I can't dig a tunnel in 600 years"", the sewer pipes smashed with stones in the sound of thunder and lightning, and the 500 long smelly sewer that I crawled through while vomiting... All these deeply depict a word: perseverance.

Anyone who wants to finally get freedom under the blue sky and white clouds must have these two kinds of talent and perseverance.

I finally realized why I am still depressed:

First: there is no talent that can hold hands

I liked painting when I was a child, but when I grew up, I concentrated on reading sages' books. In the college entrance examination, I never mentioned the paintbrush again.

I studied medicine in college, but my medical days were used to learn guitar and read idle books. After work, the guitar doesn't have time to practice, so it's naturally wasted.

For a long time, I have practiced calligraphy, seal cutting, sketching, comics, Photoshop, flash, Dreamweaver, gardening, etc. On and off. However, no matter which one I am interested in, it is typical to taste it briefly. Although the reasons for giving up halfway are different, in the end, I failed to adhere to it.

So, I'm basically the kind of person who knows a little about everything and can't do anything.

Second: no perseverance

In fact, it can be seen from the above that so many hobbies and so many attempts ended in my giving up halfway. If one can persist for half a year, the results will be very different.

I am a typical ""aspiring person who always aspires"". I have a notebook for writing plans. I don't know if others have such a book. I have to create such a small book, because every time, the plan I make will be updated.

In fact, every time I make a plan, I hope I can keep doing it, but

Knowing that I am not regular, so after the recent plan was made, I solemnly wrote down at the back of the plan: ""I hope I can stick to it for three months"" - as a result, a month later, these words made me not have the courage to look ahead when writing a new plan.",10
"Really I loved this movie

Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.

Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.

How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.",9
"If you like hopeful, surprising and never-before-seen characters, you'll love this hilarious tale of a systematically wounded prisoner family and a biblical pig.

Robbins, Freeman, and everyone else played their parts flawlessly. Their movements and body language are perfect for this story and film.",10
"This movie hits every aspect of filmmaking perfectly, every good movie should have Excellent Story, Philosophy, Character development, Suspense, Acting, Direction, bgm, thrilling climax.",10
"GOOD but too long and slow.

It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 8/10.",10
"If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10.",10
A must watch.. you never get boring watching this movie. I saw this movie over and over again and everytime i watch it i want to watch more. If you are planning to go to jail anytime soon it's a must.,10
"This was an astonishing movie it really hits the spot with all the plot twists and the characters it really is a masterpiece. I also love how the roles were played too well and how it all ended, I hope there's more to come.",1
"The acting is great, the directing is wonderful, and the choice of colors is very amazing. The movie made me feel that I am with them in prison. I enjoy when they win and grieve when they lose, and the end is very wonderful and has a wonderful pleasure.",10
"A very good movie which made me cry after so many years. The way it says to you that if you have hope you can fight the whole world, no matter what situations you get. All you need to do is to keep your brain calm and have hope in mind. Everyone's performance was very good especially the two main friends and the warden. The story in between gets a bit slow and it takes time to realise what's the main motive of the story but as it unfolds slowly you realise how epic this movie was. This movie is the best reflection of life i have ever seen and i think a person should definitely watch this before he dies.",10
"Very good film. This is definitely one of the film of all time, and Morgan Freeman is an actor in this movie, very good. Very touching, jail very scary, movie very sad, accounting very important, we should never go to jail without learning accounting, and maybe can go to jail if i am smart like the man. Much wow. I don't know how to write review. 10/10. Me love this movie, very good.",10
"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen! Great cast, direction and music on point. Watched this movie about 20 times. And every time, it's heartbreaking.",10
This is a very good movie. Believe me first I was not interested in this movie my friend recommended this movie to me . Know i just love this movie.this is a masterpiece.please watch this movie.,10
"G, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",10
"That film is a masterpiece. It is a total perfection and few to none can come close to it. I watched it recently and this is my first review. I wish i could watch the play live on the cinema but sadly i wasn't born yet.

The film shows the greatness of friendship and especially in conditions like the one of the prisoners. Without friends we can't live. Furthermore, another special elememnt is the determination, patience and strong character an individual need to have to overcome such difficlt situations. At the end you will be pleased and worth the waiting.

One more thing is we must not waste our lives because we dont have much time on the earth.",10
"It must have been at least 15 years since the last time I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"".. I was a young teenager, I couldn't understand more than what was shown in front of my eyes.. Just the surface.. It was a good movie, but ""I had"" to watch it because everybody said it's a ""must watch"" movie..

Years gone by and I could never understand why this movie was and still is the highest rated movie of all time.. Until recently..

After watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" again, my 30-year old self wants to turn back time and explain it to the young teenager.. It's not just the story, the plot, the twist, the acting, the music, the narration.. All of these surely make a good movie when presented right, but not necessarily the best of all time.. It's the fact that everybody who has experienced or is longing to experience a ""redemption"" can immediately relate to it.. Something a teenager surely can't understand, as the best years, the twisting years, the wish for redemption years just haven't come for him yet..

When you have lived some more than studying and setting pranks at school, you are hooked to this masterpiece.. It's the fact that it is the highest rated movie of all time that makes you watch it, but it's the fact that you watch it that makes it the highest rated movie of all time.. You can't help, but relate to it.. And I'm happy to see that many people out there managed to relate to it with or without understanding why.. As I did and I have now rated it with an easy ""10"".. Now that big changes are coming in my life, it's time for a shot at redemption..

""I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.. I hope I can make it.. I hope to see my future as I imagine it.. I hope to find the redemption.. I hope...""",9
"This is my first review in awhile. Figured I would just review a classic because I don't have a lot of time. GREAT movie, classic, always a good watch on a rainy day with all my classics: Green Mile, Forest Gump, Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Etc.

Just wondered why I had to scroll to the bottom on IMDb in order to review. Could use a meta bar next to the rating review at the top of the page please. I will inquire.

I love the book format this film shows. The narration and the climate build-up until the inevitable escape, leaving you edging to see how he does it, not leaving out how connected we were with the dean to wonder how he did it. I don't think anyone wanted to follow him down the rabbit hole.",10
"Some bird aren't meant to be caged. Their feather are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. But still ... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.",10

"One of the greatest movie ever. Absolutely masterpiece.

It is impossible not to be impressed by watching the book, the movie and the theater in one breath.",10
"This is about hope and freedom, I feel this the most truthful film about the its theme as the theme is so broad that can go haywire easily. This film can watched a hundred times and it can teach you 100 different things everytime. A must watch for all.",9
"The Shawshank Redempion is a great movie! It is a story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) unfairly accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is put into one of the worst prisons in the U.S., the Shawshank prison. At the beginning in the prison his only friend is Red (Morgan Freeman). Other people judge him as a coward with no guts, mainly because he never fights, takes part in sport and always has a sad face. Late the people start liking him because the discover that he a nice creative man. After the old librarian left he became the library director. In a few years he created consisting of thousands of new and old book, and he made a special reading room for people wanting to read. By doing that he improved the behavior of some prisoners and changed the whole prison. One day Andy is gone, and no one knows where he is!",8
The Shawshank Redemption(1994) is really very good movie and its my all time favourite too. Acting and Direction in movie is excellent. I saw it many times and each time I am learning something new.,10
"This is a movie to give to the people that are in need of hope. I remember when it was in the theaters and I was one of the few people that went to see it. I returned to see the film three more times, each time bring a friends that I had preached the film to. They to were inspired to rave about the film to friends.

My disappointment of the year was to see the film nominated for 7 Academy awards and not get any. I felt like Quentin Tarantino at the MTV movie awards. He said something along the lines of, ""You don't know what it is like to lose to that retard every time."" A little harsh, but to the point.

The greatest justice is that ""Forrest Gump"" is fading while ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has gained a life of it's own.",3
"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart....",7
"It is a must watch movie. You can watch it as many times as you can. This man The Morgan Freeman is outstanding with his job.

If you want to see real cinema, this movie is for you..",10
"Up until now, Misery and Stand By Me were the best movies that were turned into movies. Now Shawshank can be added to that list.

This is one of the best movies ever made, and I'm sure I'm not the first person to say that, nor will I be the last. The ranking on IMDb is a good way to measure that. As of right now, it's #3, but I'm sure it could be number 1. So I won't say all the usual good things about the movie, since we all already know how great it is. But let me add that the fact that Stephen King wrote Shawshank is one of the things that makes it so interesting to me.",8
"It deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",9
"Nice movie. Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.

Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.

And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.",10
"Nice movie bro thank you so much.im very like this movie.you must try this movie ,very recomended.just try watch and you never miss it. This is a true story wacth.",9
"I watched this movie when I was very young and I never understood its importance to me. I definitely, understand the movie better as an adult. I suggest watching it as a teen then again as an adult you will appreciate your freedom!!",8
"I think this movie was very realistic and I realized that live in prison is pretty far from reality. Prison is not a joke, prison will change you against your will. Andy Durfsteen is wonderful character. He is full of surprises till the end. He has the power to change the hell into heaven. He shows us that power is not stored only in muscles but in brain too. He believes in hope. He knows that he is supposed to be in prison to the end of his life but there is still hope. He has plenty of time for escape and with hope he can get over everything. With enough time and plenty of hope you can escape through 10 meters fat wall with a spoon. Thats all whats this movie about but its not enough to know, you have to understand, you have to see it. Please excuse my English but I had to write something.",9
"This film is not about escape, as it might seem at first. He: about the hard life fate of people whom she broke for one mistake in life, thus testing for strength. And only the strong could get up and go on, no matter what. These people turned out to be: Andy Dufresne and Ellis Redding, who, having given their time to fate, learned to appreciate simple but good things, like hope, which do not die, but make you happier, albeit in the future, which Andy and Red deservedly become real .",10
"This is with out doubt one of the best film ever made, it shows how the best of human nature can triumph in the darkest hour. The script is flawless and the acting is sublime. I've seen it more times than i can count and it never gets tired. Brilliant! The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it. It's the kind of friendship that is honest, truthful and brings you back to the time in your life when the world was new and you and your friend owned it and in that sense it makes you think of another classic ""Stand by me"" by Stephen King. And it is this friendship and how the author, scriptwriters, director and cast manage to paint in colors that ring true to our heart that truly makes this film stand out.",10
"Well, what can I say? IT'S A MUST-WATCH MOVIE! It will show you a different perspective of life, a reminder to take control of your life. In my opinion, there are only few movies that you would encounter such as this, it's one of a kind. I couldn't elaborate more because that'd spoil your watching. I think I no need to persuade because at the end of movie, I assure you will agree with me.",10
"If i happends to have the chance to see this movie it's because of my mom, i was't really trilled to look azt this movie but then i got more and more exciteded cause it seemed very special. It was such a awsome movie I only can say thank to my mum. Noemaly i 'am the one who gives her the best movies or sugesst her the best ones , but this times i got surprised by my own mother, and noz i 'am chocked cause I was supossed to know every good movie. But when i was listing all the traillers she said stop, your're going to like this one. And i said ohhh welll okay why not,when the movie ended she told me did you like it ? And I said normaly i did ask that question.",10

"This film shaped my life, every character, every dialogue is special in this movie.

This movie taught me so much and helped me to look at things differently.

"Nice movies for me. I think The Shawshank Redemption is the best action drama that you want to watch with your partner. While The Shawshank Redemption received critical acclaim on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box-office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump, the general unpopularity of prison films, its lack of female characters. Over 320,000 VHS rental copies were shipped throughout the United States, and on the strength of its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top video rentals of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. Decades after its release, the film was still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration or naming it a favorite in various surveys, leading to its recognition as one of the most ""beloved"" films ever made. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".",10
"I am someone who loves prison themed movies. The first time I got to know this film was through a friend of mine. After I saw the film, I was very impressed. Because I think this film is very relatable to what I want. Amazingly, the main character managed to escape without the prison guards knowing. What an excellent combination of intelligence and composure. Besides that, the interesting thing that I like about this part of the film is the moment of socializing the main character to all prison prisoners. From being a nobody, he became a respected person thanks to his calm and ingenuity. The storyline is also very interesting, I can't say much more, the point is this movie is very good and I really like it.",10
"'Shawshank Redemtion' is about closure, we all want something in life, which sometimes is fair, which isn't. I have seen drama and the storytelling was amazing and it was a constant hook. The characters shown kept me hooked during the whole movie. I felt goosebumps at times.

I am a filmmaker. From a filmmaker's point of cinematography was brilliant. In the film, there was a true sense of friendship, deception, and corruption were shown. The dialogues made sense and it was inspirational. The movie has a compelling story. The twists and turns. It also inspires people about hope and as well as how time is such a valuable asset in life. A treasured, ceaselessly reentered, classic film.

It is a film finally, persistence and unwaveringness, not provocative characteristics, maybe, yet they develop on you during the underground advancement of this story, which is about how two men carrying out life punishments in jail become companions and figure out how to ward off despair.

There is something interesting about the mood of The Shawshank Redemption: it is a sluggish film, one that takes as much time as is needed to recount to us its story throughout its practically 2.5 hour running time, however it additionally feels like such an arresting encounter. Numerous scenes have the characters simply addressing one another and that's it, yet you can in any case feel the fervor. It seems like they are wanting to get away yet they are simply discussing life. That power happens due to a very much drawn script by Darabont and the astonishing science among Freeman and Robbins. It's simply so gorgeous and profound to watch them bond and their companionship unfurl.

I recommend that it is a must-watch movie.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption is the top-rated movie among the top 250 English-language films on IMBd with a 9.3 rating. Many critics of movies consider it to be among the best movies ever made in cinema history. This film's plot was adapted by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's book Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.

Tim Robbins, who I had never seen before, was in this movie for the first time. He gave without a doubt the best acting performance of his career in this film, but surprisingly, the Oscars did not recognise it. During the early phases of development, a number of renowned actors, including Tom Cruise, were proposed to take the lead part, but nothing materialised. In the end, Tim Robbins.",9

So many feelings and realizations in only one film !!! But what a Film !!! If this film cannot move you ... nobody can !!",10
"This is a great two-hour film about life after an irreparable mistake. It is a simple story about the importance of friendship, hope and faith in oneself. A story of redemption and the condemnation of the innocent.

I have seen this movie more than 5 times and every time I worry about the main character - ""Andy Dufresne run even faster"". The cast is very good and I can't imagine anyone other than these actors. And the duo of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is brilliant, and their chemistry on screen is undeniable.

Overall, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a timeless classic that deserves to be watched and rewatched. It's a film that reminds us of the power of the human spirit and the importance of never giving up hope, no matter how dire the circumstances may seem.",10

"This is the #1 rated movie on IMDb. It's not my #1 but it's up there. This is a perfect example for a perfect movie. While is has dark aspects in a movie that you finish feeling hopeful. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in this and the prison setting. There's something I love about this movies time period, it interacts perfect with the characters. The cinematography is also perfect down to the shots and the look of the prison, it's not shiny and glossy but it fits the story and the setting. This is one of the films that I will first show to my children as it's a timeless movie. The old librarian man is one of the saddest endings to a character ever.",10
"A film is only as good as the after effect that it leaves on you. Shawshank leaves you with a warm glow of fulfilness, which in my opinion is matched only by The Usual Suspects. Tim Robbins, gives a once in a life time performance, as the silver spoon banker wrongly thrown into prison.

The plot is second to none... which is one of the reasons this film is loved by so many. The simple but involving story grabs you, so as you feel almost at one with the prisoners, only to then reveal the clever twist at the end. At which you realise how you never were a part, but only a pawn in this masterpiece.",10

"In addition to its emotional depth, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is also a masterclass in storytelling. The film's structure is expertly crafted, with a series of twists and turns that keep the audience engaged and invested in the characters. The script is filled with memorable dialogue and poignant moments, including the iconic scene in which Andy plays Mozart over the prison's loudspeakers.

Its themes of hope, redemption, and the power of human connection continue to resonate with audiences decades after its release. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and experience this cinematic masterpiece for yourself.",10
"I have not watched nor really into movies but I love the way producers made an effort to produce this one of a kind movie. The story really tells you clearly on what context they are trying to portray. Even the actors are on point with their acting ability and skills. They really show their mastery on creating this craft. Moreover, not everyone will appreciate this as it is normal, but I am belong to those viewers who has been captivated by this movie. I wanna see more of this, not just with the original casts in the movie, but maybe somehow revived into a newer version to cope up with latest elements in movie industry.",10
"I really like The Shawsank Redemption movie. This film has a plot that is a little boring at the beginning but the middle towards the end of the story, the plot is getting more interesting. Make the audience do not want to miss a single scene. A film that teaches patience, struggle and a sense of persistence in defending the truth. Not afraid to fight against the stupidity of the government regime, the police who arbitrarily imprison people. This kind of error occurs frequently. The struggle of the main character to escape from prison really impressed me. Very beautifull and epic ending. I think this movie one of the best all times.",10

"This film is very good where we are very impressed with the storyline presented, especially the dramatic effects given by the producer I always look forward to seeing this film every year in my life.

"I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie.",10
"A very interesting correct film based on real events evokes pity and respect for the main characters, their emancipation admires at the same time makes it clear how complex our world is and how various destinies intertwine unexpectedly gives an impulse to do good deeds despite all the hardships and hardships, while also preserving all those who are watching to remain yourself with all the events that happen and dream as soon as you plunge into the film you will capture the plot and you will really empathize and watch with interest how it all ends at the same time feeling like the main characters but also not like your usual consciousness who feels you as a whole person I wish you enjoy watching.",10
"One of my favorite movies ever, The Shawshank Redemption is a modern-day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place. Realiff is the best real estate company like Zillow, realtor. Based on a Stephen King novel, this movie makes us feel different watching this film than most others as this is an incredibly realistic film. Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne who is convicted of murder and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding who is a fellow inmate and close friend of Dufresne and Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton who is the Warden of Shawshank State Prison and is a character who has mixed feelings and emotions towards everyone around him and a character who is sometimes easy to like and at other times easy to despise. This film is easily considered one of the greatest films of all time and I definitely agree with this fact. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards including (Best Picture, Best Actor Realiff, Morgan Freeman, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound) but didn't win any due to tough competition from the film Forrest Gump. I personally think that Tim Robbins should have been nominated for the Best Actor award as he really gave the performance of his career. Bravo to this brilliant modern-day classic!",10
"An amazing film! When I started watching this film I fell in love with it almost immediately. It's mesmerising from the first seconds and you want to see it through to the end. It was morally difficult at times, but at the same time I didn't want to stop it. I think a lot of people will like this movie and show them that if you want something badly enough, you'll get it. Then people will be motivated and want to do new things and reach new heights. Many people will probably re-watch this film more than once. It definitely deserves it, and the acting is great. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do.",10
"This is a movie you can watch over & over and it's just as good as the first time you watched it!! It has humor, sorrow, and heart warming moments...it goes through all your emotions. It shows what friendship can do for men on the inside. Andy (the main character) is pretty low key, but smart as a whip. And of corse his man man Red...well you can't help but love him. I think it was their friendship that carried the both of them though the day to day life of being locked up and all the caos that comes along with doing hard time. I love the fact that it takes place in the early 1900's. It gives it a slower vibe then if it were made for the 2000's. I would definatly recomend this film for sure!",10
"Based on a novella by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a harrowing tale about the triumph of the human spirit. It is a great film. Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner. The Shawshank Redemption is a roaring artistic success on every level. Not only do the performance of Freeman and Robbins rank among the best of all time, but Shawshank is filled with brilliantly realized supporting characters who surprise and enthrall in equal measure.",10
"It is no marvel that the movie has such a excessive rating, it is pretty actually breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't stated before? Not much, it is the story, the acting, the premise, however most of all, this film is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can not take into account it days later, this movie loves with you, as soon as you have viewed it, you do not forget.

The closing story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I apprehend why so many classification this as the first-class movie of all time, it isn't always mine, however I get it. If you have not considered it, or have not viewed it for some time, you want to watch it, it is.",10
"The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!

It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.

I loved it!!",8
"Best movie ever, i love to watch this movie What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.",9
"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.. Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed.",10
"Aftet watching this movie once, it was in my Top 20, after watching it twice it was in My Top 10, and after watching it multiple times, it's going to take a hell of a good movie took knock it off my #1 movie of all time.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbin's in easily both of their greatest performances of all time, make this one movie that will hands down go as the best movie of all time without an Oscar. The first hour or so is moving beyond a shadow of a doubt, but the last two will draw you to tears and inspire you beyond words.

Watch it, watch it and watch it again!!!",10
"Absolutely loved this movie. The visuals were stellar. The type of movie you can sit and watch from start to finish. Simple and stylesque. This movie is sure to be a classic as time goes on. When it first previewed many were concerned that the movie was heavy on the trailer hype but soon after the first critics flooded the cinemas they quickly learned that Shawshank Redemption was a timeless work of art and destined for top box office ratings. Moreover, the movie was family friendly and a tearjerker for many. We can only hope for more movies such as these by this director and producer. Will be waiting!",10
"Probably Stephen King's best adaptation ever. Of the kind to make have a change of mind those who consider King as a minor writer only good to work in the horror. Having seen this movie and then ""The Green Mile"" and ""The mist"", one thing's for sure : Frank Darabont should be the only one authorized to turn Stephen King's writings into movies. I regret that this magnificent movie received no Oscar, in spite of its nominations numerous. The Oscar of best actor for Morgan Freeman, best score for Thomas Newman and best cinematography for Roger Deakins would not have been stolen. I would have also awarded Bob Gunton as best actor in a supporting role",8
"It is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.

The ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.

I understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing.",9

"The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie(in my views) of all time. The story of the film is fantastic and the cinematography is absolutely splendid. It shows the nature of human being in psychological perspective and in social perspective as well. From early ages Human being adjust himself in the surroundings and feel very depressed when he is compelled to leave that place, this leaves the worse psychological and mental depression on human being. This what this movie shows very well. When you have to release one bird from the cage you should also consult everyone in the cage to decide which bird is to be released.",10
"One of the best hollywood movies I have ever watched. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.

Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".

The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.",10
"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's best performances, along with one of Stephen King's best book, make this phenomenal drama one of the best movies of all time.",10
"Conan is set in modern Japan and tells the story of a famous young detective named Kudo Shinichi. During an investigation of the culprit, he was given a poison to drink by a black organization, causing his body to shrink into an elementary school student. Fortunately, however, his brain was still normal. With the help of a professor, he goes on to live with the other name Conan, solving the mysteries behind the cases and searching for the black organization that has harmed him. This is a movie with a good story and charisma that makes me always excited and look forward to the thrilling situations in the next episodes.",9
"Really love the actors in this movie, such amazing work from everyone. This movie was such a great experience of adventure and excitement, as a kid it really was incredible to learn about the prison system and it was also terrifying to image being stuck in a situation like this.

I think that Morgan Freeman was such an amazing actor in this movie and really made the film flow so well.

The escape scene was my favorite part, the planning and preparation that went into getting out of prison was very fun to watch. I am glad that he made it out and got free but the ending was very sad.

This movie puts like into a delicate perspective and makes you want to live a good one.",10
"I just watched this film for the first time in my media, and it is amazing. My teacher was so right on how good this is, I could watch this all day if i could. We was not able to watch the whole thing in class, but I definitely went straight home after school to finish watching it.

I wonder why no one has recommended this to me before, but I'm glad my teacher had chosen for the class to watch it. I'm for sure recommending this to other people my age. I hope there will more films like this in the future, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

This film also makes me feel that I need to start watching more films from the 1990s. :)",9
"I will highly recommend you all to watch The Shawshank Redemption, it is incredible before watching this movie I thought that it is average but after watching this movie I am in love with this movie. I have watched this movie on loop and still want to watch this movie again in my leisure time.

This is the ultimate story of friendship, hope, life, and overcoming the adversity of you life.

Now I get totally it why so many class this as the best film of all time. If you haven't watched this movie yet, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing and a treat to watch. 10 on 10 for The Shawshank Redemption.",10
This is probably the best movie of all times! It is certainly my favorite movie ever. Tim Robbins does an outstanding job here! I don't think there is another movie that captures the triupmh of the human spirit. It is certainly inspirational. Andy Dufresne is the perfect example of perseverence and faith. Excellent movie!,10
"I'm new to this so don't beat me up. I have seen this movie so may times I can not count. If it is on I'll get hooked into watching and I know I may have seen the beginning of the movie twice. Morgan and Tim friendship in the movie is what makes this movie click. It give us a good idea on what prison life was like in the 50ish years. I would assume in some aspect in prison life a lot has changed, but some stay the same. I'm a sucker for these type of movie that goes through a time line in peoples lives. I tend to want to know my characters in a movie then speed through not knowing a small history of the character It is on my top 20 must see!!!",10
"I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.

Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.

Something that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.

For me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.

Brilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.",1
"I can't count how many times I've watched this movie, but more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me realize Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I've never seen an actor before.

I've been a huge fan of everything Stephen King wrote from a very young age and had read the short story this movie is based on years before I saw this movie.

Everything Stephen King wrote and made into a movie doesn't turn out well, but this one is as close to perfection as can be and has everything you could want in a movie.

One thing that is extraordinary is that there is no real action, no special effects and no cheats. 99% of the movie is about men in prison uniforms talking. Yet it almost certainly catches you from the very beginning and sticks you to the screen all the way.

What really makes this movie one of the best for me is the message of eternal hope it conveys from start to finish. The main character's never giving up attitude is very well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending gives me goosebumps every time I see it, no matter how many times I've seen it.",10
"Given how gorgeous the movie is, it is not surprising that it receives such a high rating. What can I add that hasn't already been said? The script, the performances, and the basic idea are all there, but the main focus of this film is how it makes you feel. Unlike some movies that you watch and then forget about days later, this movie sticks with you after you've seen it.

The ultimate tale of friendship, optimism, and perseverance in the face of difficulty.

Although I don't think this is the greatest movie ever made, I can see why so many people do. You must watch it if you haven't or haven't in a while because it's incredible. 10/10.",10
"Wow....

The acting, writing, cinematography, and the casting are all fantastic. No Matter the number of times you watch this film you will always feel blown away by the the sheer execution and perfection of it by the end. The plot is for finely written that the story keeps you on the edge of your seat/coach the entire time! This movie in-bodies amazing cinema and can be appreciated by all people of all ages, no matter their prior exposure to movies.

Now, nothing deserves a true 10/10, this movie isn't perfect, but it is very close.

Truly one of the greatest films of all time, not my favorite but it is definitely in my top 10. Definitely a must watch for all ages.",10
"This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.",9
